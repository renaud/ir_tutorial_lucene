20922542:0	Introduction 
Conventional or laparoscopic surgery is a controlled trauma with a stress response and immunological consequences.
20922542:1	Operative trauma, measured by the magnitude and type of intra-operative injury determine the extent and duration of the postoperative inflammatory and immunological responses.
20922542:2	Postoperative immunesuppression may have important consequences as it has been related to infectious complications and tumor metastasis formation  . 
Major surgery remains associated with undesirable postoperative side effects such as pain, cardiopulmonary, infective and thromboembolic complications, gastrointestinal paralysis, fatigue, and prolonged convalescence.
20922542:3	A key factor in postoperative morbidity is the surgical stress response with subsequent increased demand on the patient's reserves and immune competence.
20922542:4	Increased demands in organ functions are thought to be mediated by trauma-induced endocrine and metabolic changes.
20922542:5	Some laparoscopic interventions have been shown to reduce postoperative morbidity  .
20922542:6	Since the introduction of the laparoscopic approach, immunological competence and stress response to surgery have been increasingly studied in an attempt to explain short-term advantages found for some minimally invasive techniques  . The most studied cytokine is interleukin-6 (IL-6).
20922542:7	It reflects the operative trauma and is a predictor of postoperative complications.
20922542:8	Laparoscopic interventions such as Nissen fundoplication  and cholecystectomy  offer clear clinical advantages in comparison with the conventional approach, probably based on a better preserved immune system.
20922542:9	More extensive interventions such as laparoscopic colectomy have also been shown to provide clinical benefits such as a reduction of morbidity, less postoperative pain, earlier recovery, and shorter hospital stay when compared with the open approach  . As a result, laparoscopic colectomy is increasingly becoming the preferred procedure in clinical practice.
20922542:10	At the same time, laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) in rectal cancer is being used more frequently, mostly on trial bases.
20922542:11	Currently, no data is available regarding surgical stress response and immune competence following open or laparoscopic TME surgery in rectal cancer.
20922542:12	As a sub-study of the randomized COLOR II study, which compares the open and laparoscopic approach for rectal cancer, we studied the postoperative stress response, inflammatory and immune function in patients undergoing open or laparoscopic TME in an attempt to provide insight into the differences of postoperative trauma here considered.
20922542:13	Study design 
In June 2006, the VU University Medical Center (VUmc) initiated participation in the COLOR II trial; a randomized study comparing laparoscopic to open TME in patients with non-metastasized rectal cancer.
20922542:14	All patients who were randomized until December 2008 for the COLOR II trial at the VUmc were included into this sub-study.
20922542:15	The primary endpoints of the study were to demonstrate differences in inflammatory response by evaluating pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and interleukin-8) and C-reactive protein (CRP); immune status by evaluating white blood cells and HLA-DR expression on monocytes; and stress response by evaluating cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone in both groups of patients.
20922542:16	The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all participating patients.
20922542:17	Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study were as described in the COLOR II protocol 
In the present study, patients were analyzed according to an intention to treat principle.
20922542:18	Material and methods 
Peripheral blood and serum (BD Vacutainer Systems, Plymouth, UK) were collected preoperatively (baseline), 2, 24, and, 72 h after surgery.
20922542:19	Serum interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 samples were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 rpm at 4°C.
20922542:20	All samples were stored in aliquots at −80°C until tested.
20922542:21	Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software package (SPSS 16.0 for Windows; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
20922542:22	Medians, means, ranges, and interquartile ranges were calculated and subsequently depicted when appropriate.
20922542:23	The Mann–Whitney U test, Chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test were applied when appropriate for group comparisons.
20922542:24	The independent samples T test was used to compare group means.
20922542:25	Significance was set at p  < 0.05
20922542:26	Results 
Forty patients with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range, 60–74 years) were included in this prospective randomized trial.
20922542:27	Twenty-eight men (70%) and 12 women (30%) with a median body mass index of 25 kg/m 2 (interquartile range: 23.5–26.4 kg/m 2).
20922542:28	Median distance of the tumor to the anal verge was 10 cm (interquartile range: 5.5–15 cm).
20922542:29	Eighteen patients (45%) were randomized to open surgery and 22 patients (55%) to laparoscopic surgery.
20922542:30	The demographic data are shown in Table  . Patient characteristics in terms of gender, age, body mass index, ASA classification, localization of the tumor, and type of neoadjuvant therapy were comparable for the open and laparoscopic groups (Table  ).
20922542:31	Furthermore, type of operation, proximal mesorectal excision, TME, or abdominoperineal resection was comparable.
20922542:32	Operation time was significantly longer for laparoscopic procedures, but was accompanied by less blood loss.
20922542:33	In patients randomized to laparoscopic surgery, two patients needed some form of conversion by a Pfannenstiel incision and were analyzed according to an intention to treat principle.
20922542:34	Morbidity and mortality data, for both groups, are depicted in Table  . In the laparoscopic and in the open group, six (27%) and four (22%) patients had some form of (infectious) complications ( P  = 0.71), respectively.
20922542:35	The median time to develop the complication in the laparoscopic and open group was 5 days (range 1–10 days) and 6 days (range 3–7 days), respectively.
20922542:36	No mortality was seen in the laparoscopic group, one patient died 3 days postoperatively in the open group due to myocardial infarction ( P  = 0.45).
20922542:37	No differences were observed in terms of tumor stage or extensity of resection (expressed by lymph node harvest and specimen length).
20922542:38	Discussion 
In general, laparoscopic surgery is thought to reduce the magnitude of operative trauma.
20922542:39	If alterations of immune function and stress response are proportional to the extent of injury, the response following laparoscopic surgery will be reduced when compared with conventional surgery.
20922542:40	Many studies have shown that relatively wound-limited interventions such as laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication  and cholecystectomy  are associated with a tempered systemic inflammatory response and preservation of the postoperative immune function when compared to the open approach.
20922542:41	The stress response to injury and surgery has also been previously described.
20922542:42	Anterior pituitary hormone secretion is stimulated by hypothalamic releasing factors . Cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin are secreted in increased amounts from the pituitary in response to a surgical stimulus.
20922542:43	Currently, there are few data of postoperative immune function and stress response after more invasive procedure such as laparoscopic colectomy and rectal resections.
20922542:44	In more extensive operations, with more operative wound surface such as laparoscopic colectomy, differences with the conventional approach concerning systemic inflammatory and immune response are more difficult to demonstrate and only a relatively low postoperative IL-6 level has been found consistently in the laparoscopic group.
20922542:45	Harmon et al.  were the first to describe differences in postoperative IL-6 levels when laparoscopic colectomy was compared to the open technique.
20922542:46	Wu et al.  measured cytokine levels both in serum as well as in peritoneal drain fluid.
20922542:47	They found significantly lower levels of IL-6 after laparoscopic surgery confirming the earlier studies.
20922542:48	CRP is the only acute phase protein which was measured.
20922542:49	Since IL-6 is the mean stimulator of CRP production, it is not surprising that the results are comparable.
20922542:50	A large randomized study by Schwenk et al.  showed significantly lower peak concentrations of IL-6 and CRP 2 days after colon surgery.
20922542:51	Nevertheless, short-term clinical advantages of laparoscopic colectomy have been shown in different randomized studies.
20922542:52	This has been the reason to extend the laparoscopic approach to the surgical treatment of rectal cancer by means of laparoscopic TME, mostly on trial bases.
20922542:53	To demonstrate clinical differences between open and laparoscopic TME, especially the rate of local recurrence and morbidity, the COLOR II study was started.
20922542:54	Along with these questions, the study of biological consequences will offer more insight in the possible advantages of these two different surgical approaches to rectal cancer.
20922542:55	In the here presented sub-study of the randomized COLOR II trial, the immune competence and stress response following laparoscopic and open TME has demonstrated some subtle differences between both groups.
20922542:56	Significantly lower levels of IL-6 were detected 2 h following laparoscopic surgery; in the subsequent days this difference diminished in concordance with a previous study presented by our institution regarding open and laparoscopic colectomy .
20922542:57	Moreover, a significant lower depression was found in immune competence 2 h following laparoscopic surgery, since HLA-DR expression was better preserved.
20922542:58	This may be interpreted as an important short-term enhanced defense mechanism after laparoscopy, against infections but also theoretically against spreading malignant cells in the circulation . Wind et al.  described an important increase in circulating tumor cells shortly after initiating surgery.
20922542:59	Therefore, a better preserved immune function could prevent tumor nestling and therefore distant metastases formation.
20922542:60	Therefore, it will be interesting to further investigate if the short-term advantages described in the present study will have oncological advantages in the long-term.
20922542:61	However, in the subsequent days the differences diminished, as described for the IL-6 levels.
20922542:62	No significant differences between open and laparoscopic surgery were found regarding white blood cell count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein level, interleukin-8 level, or cortisol level.
20922542:63	Moreover, no differences could be found regarding postoperative stress response.
20922542:64	In conclusion, although after both laparoscopic and open TME a decrease in immune competence is seen, this competence is better preserved immediately after laparoscopic surgery when compared to the open approach.
20922542:65	Also, IL-6 levels are lower 2 h following laparoscopic surgery, indicating a diminished surgical trauma.
20922542:66	However, the differences were not consistent at all time intervals, making a definitive conclusion difficult.
20922542:67	Although, in the present study, the described differences did not result in any clinical advantages such as less morbidity, the differences on the short term may reflect the less-invasive character of the laparoscopic TME procedure when compared to the open approach.
20922542:68	Moreover, an increased immune response may be most important shortly after initiating surgery as the level of circulating tumor cells is highest following manipulation of the tumor . Larger studies are required for more definitive results.
18838555:0	Introduction 
Cardiomyocytes actively divide during embryonic development but exit the cell cycle and stop proliferating shortly after birth ( ; ; ).
18838555:1	The incapacity of adult cardiomyocytes to divide underlies the inability of the heart muscle to regenerate after an injury, such as a myocardial infarction, that frequently leads to overload and heart failure.
18838555:2	Notch signaling is normally active in the embryonic heart of multiple species, where it influences cell fate and morphogenesis, including within the early myocardial field, atrioventricular canal myocardium and cushions, and in the ventricular wall ( ; ; ; ; ; ).
18838555:3	In addition to controlling cell fate, several studies indicate that Notch influences tissue formation and morphogenesis during development by regulating the balance between a progenitor or precursor pool and differentiating progeny ( ; ; ; ).
18838555:4	In principal, a similar process could contribute to tissue regeneration ( ; ; ; ; ).
18838555:5	Because the signals that control fetal and early neonatal cardiomyocyte replication and the subsequent postnatal withdrawal from cell cycle are unclear, we explored whether Notch reactivation might trigger and sustain the cell cycle of neonatal dividing and quiescent cardiomyocytes.
18838555:6	Binding to the transmembrane Delta or Jagged ligands on a signaling cell triggers a γ-secretase–dependent proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane Notch receptors on the responding cell.
18838555:7	Cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain (ICD) that complexes with the transcription factor recombination signal-binding protein 1 for Jκ (RBP-Jκ; also known as CSL [CBF1, Su(H), LAG-1]) to activate transcription of downstream targets.
18838555:8	In addition to this canonical cascade, RBP-Jκ–independent signaling has recently been demonstrated to occur through various intermediaries, including the Dishevelled (Dsh) protein required for Wnt signaling ( ; ).
18838555:9	Despite its involvement in tumorigenesis and tissue morphogenesis, details of the mechanisms that might link Notch signaling to cell cycle control are unclear, although the complex containing the Notch ICD and RBP-Jκ directly activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene promoter.
18838555:10	We found that activation of the Notch pathway in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived and early neonatal cardiomyocytes induced cyclin D expression and stimulated cell cycle entry, mitosis, and cell division.
18838555:11	Cell cycle progression involved the RBP-Jκ–dependent induction of cyclin D1, which led to its cytosolic accumulation.
18838555:12	Translocation to the nucleus, retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation, and cell cycle entry, however, specifically required the Notch ICD.
18838555:13	This constitutes a novel function for the ICD that might account for aspects of RBP-Jκ–independent signaling that have been implicated recently in tumorigenesis (for reviews see ; ).
18838555:14	Interestingly, N2 ICD induced older cardiomyocytes to enter cell cycle; however, DNA damage checkpoint activation and G 2/M interphase arrest followed, most likely reflecting an intrinsic barrier to replication of mature cardiomyocytes that might serve a beneficial role in the mature heart by preventing mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in response to mitogenic stimuli.
18838555:15	Together, these results point to a role for Notch in the expansion of cardiomyocyte progenitor or precursor pools needed for heart growth during development and potentially during regeneration after injury in the adult.
18838555:16	Results 
Discussion 
We found that cell cycle entry of mESC-derived and quiescent cardiomyocytes could be profoundly enhanced by Notch activation, which controlled expression and nuclear localization of cyclin D1.
18838555:17	Transcriptional induction of the cyclin D1 gene required canonical Notch signaling through RBP-Jκ.
18838555:18	Nuclear localization however was a distinct property of the Notch ICD that is essential for cell cycle entry.
18838555:19	The implications of these findings for regulating expansion of cardiomyogenic progenitor or precursor cells and in the control of other normal and pathological processes, such as tumorigenesis, are discussed in the following paragraphs.
21707967:0	Background 
The use of medicinal plants has occurred in Egypt since Pharaonic times .
21707967:1	This constituted an integral part of the practiced medicine at that time.
21707967:2	Nowadays, Egyptians still depend of medicinal plants for treatment.
21707967:3	In a recent study conducted by the Information and Decision Support Centre in Egypt , it was found that 23% of the Egyptian use medicinal plants as a remedy; 52% of them are living in urban areas and 48% are living in countryside.
21707967:4	It is important to document these uses and perform studies about their pharmacological activities to assure their efficacy and safety.
21707967:5	Beni-Sueif is situated in the north of Upper Egypt and occupies a land area of approximately 10954 km 2.
21707967:6	The governorate has a total inhabitancy of 1369.41 km 2.
21707967:7	It boasts a population of over 2315512.
21707967:8	The language of inhabitants is Arabic.
21707967:9	Biomedical facilities and prescription medication are available in the towns of the governorate in addition to the herbalist shops.
21707967:10	The latter represents the main healthcare facility in the countryside.
21707967:11	Beni-Sueif has different phytogeographical regions; the desert regions of the western and eastern sides of the Nile and the Nile-valley characterized by its fertile soil . Beni-Sueif governorate is producing 25% of medicinal and aromatic plants produced in Egypt.
21707967:12	This is mainly because of the presence of suitable climate, fertile soil and availability of irrigation water from the Nile.
21707967:13	Pelargonium roseum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Artemisia herba-alba Asso.,
21707967:14	Mentha piperita L., Coriandrum sativum L., Anethum graveolens L., Origanum majorana L. and Jasminum officinale L. are the most important medicinal and aromatic plants produced in the governorate.
21707967:15	Table shows the production figures for these plants.
21707967:16	The present study aims to review traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge of the local people in Beni-Sueif governorate, focusing specifically on the medicinal uses of plants.
21707967:17	These types of studies are urgent considering the loss of traditional knowledge accompanying alteration of the physical and biological environment.

Results 
Discussion 
Documentation of ethnobotanical knowledge is important to study/understand human-plant relationships , implement general policies about the use of natural resources  and assess potential livelihood and monetary benefits . 
In this work, we used two quantitative tools to study the main medicinal plants and spices used by the local people in Beni-Sueif governorate.
21707967:19	With the F IC, the main categories of health conditions for which plants are used, are detected, and with the FI, we selected the most important species from these categories.
21707967:20	The cardiovascular, immunological, gastrointestinal and respiratory categories used the most plants.
21707967:21	The FI and the number of uses mentioned support the F IC.
21707967:22	This is indicated by the observation that the cardiovascular category has the highest F IC.
21707967:23	This means that the cardiovascular illnesses have the greatest agreement among the informants for being treated by medicinal plants.
21707967:24	Hibiscus sabdariffa the most used plant in the cardiovascular category, has the highest FI and number of uses mentioned among all of the plants.
21707967:25	Therefore, the F IC is a good analytical tool to select categories of illness when analyzing the data as they are presented here.
21707967:26	If we consider FI and the use mentions to analyze the most important plants, we get the following plants: Hibiscus sabdariffa for hypertension, Mentha piperita for colic in gastrointestinal tract, Trigonella foenum-graecum for colic in gastrointestinal tract and Pimpinella anisum for upper respiratory tract problems.
21707967:27	These plants are cultivated plants and widely used in the Egyptian folk medicine . There are a lot of studies about the pharmacological activities of these plants; Hibiscus sabdariffa [ - ], Mentha piperita , Trigonella foenum-graecum  and Pimpinella anisum . We have decided to present here the most significant and important studies related to the uses mentioned in our study.
21707967:28	The uncommon ethnopharmacological uses of Glossostemon bruguieri Desf.,
21707967:29	Lupinus albus, Orchis hircine and Portulaca oleracea L. deserves phytochemical and pharmacological studies to examine the reported activities.
21707967:30	Some of the uses mentioned are in agreement with those previously reported in the Mediterranean region . For example, Portulaca oleracea was reported to be used in muscular-skeletal diseases and for nutritional purposes in Albania, Ammi visnaga for kidney and respiratory diseases in Algeria and Egypt, Coriandrum sativum as digestive in Algeria, Foeniculum vulgare as digestive in Algeria and Cyperus, Solenostemma argel for kidney diseases in Egypt, Mentha piperita for mental-nervous disorders in Algeria, Hibiscus sabdariffa for cardiovascular disorders in Egypt.
21707967:31	Conclusions 
The current study targeted the medicinal plants used by local people of Beni-Sueif, Upper Egypt.
21707967:32	Beni-Sueif is a biodiversity area rich of wide-variety of plant species.
21707967:33	The calculated F IC and FI values were used as a tool to understand which illnesses are preferentially treated with medicinal plants.
21707967:34	Gastrointestinal problems, cough and hypertension were the main illnesses treated by medicinal plants in Beni-Sueif governorate.
21707967:35	People may use medicinal plants as an adjuvant therapy to treat these illnesses due to the common occurrence of the former two illnesses and the chronic nature of the latter illness.
21707967:36	This may be the reason for why these illnesses have high agreement values.
21707967:37	The preservation of the traditional knowledge is an essential requirement for maintaining traditional Egyptian medicine as a cultural resource.

20957232:0	Introduction 
The evolution of sex and maintenance of sex are important unanswered questions in evolutionary biology .
20957232:1	Although vertebrates are ancestrally sexual, asexuality has arisen via hybridization at least 90 times in the vertebrate lineage . Asexual vertebrates provide an opportunity to evaluate the reasons why asexual reproduction is rare among vertebrates, and more generally how asexual and sexual species are able to coexist.
20957232:2	All known asexual fishes and amphibians, which together comprise the majority of known asexual vertebrates, are sperm-dependent.
20957232:3	The coexistence of sperm-dependent asexuals with their sexually reproducing sperm donors is particularly problematic because the competitive success of the hybrids, resulting from the two-fold “cost of sex” , , will ultimately lead to the extinction of both hybrids and parentals.
20957232:4	Asexuality may thus be rare among vertebrates because asexuals arise very rarely, or, once arisen, asexuals may be unable to persist.
20957232:5	There are a variety of factors that might contribute to the successful coexistence of asexually- and sexually-reproducing species , .
20957232:6	One such factor is the existence of important ecological differences between the asexuals and sexuals.
20957232:7	If these ecological differences are important in allowing the persistence of the asexuals, then one would expect that coexistence would be successful in some habitats (e.g., lakes with particular physiochemical characteristics) and not in others.
20957232:8	The broad-scale distribution of asexuals may therefore be correlated with broad-scale habitat variation.
20957232:9	Hybrid fish in the genus Phoxinus have originated from hybridization between P. eos Cope, 1862, and P. neogaeus Cope, 1867 . The most striking consequence of hybridization in the case hybrid Phoxinus is that the hybrids are all female and reproduce via gynogenesis – a mode of sperm-dependent asexual reproduction in which sperm from a parental species is required to stimulate egg development, but not for its genetic contribution . A consequence of this sperm-dependent asexual reproduction is that the hybrids must always coexist with at least one parental species.
20957232:10	The hybrid Phoxinus populations studied to date usually coexist with only P. eos although populations coexisting with P. neogaeus or with both parental species are not uncommon , . The two parental species are both widespread in North America and do sometimes coexist, but there is no evidence of ongoing or even recent hybridization between P. eos and P. neogaeus , , . Angers & Schlosser estimated that hybridization between P. eos and P. neogaeus occurred during the last glaciation, roughly 50 000 years ago, when all North American freshwater fish species were confined to a few glacial refugia.
20957232:11	It is possible that many hybrid clones originated at the time when hybrids were formed, but only certain clones (or lineages) were able to survive and expand their range along with the parental species following de-glaciation.
20957232:12	The hybrid Phoxinus “species”, which, in reality, consists of a number of clonal lineages that originated at the time of hybridization is thought to be widely distributed in Canada and the northern United States.
20957232:13	Given that hybrid Phoxinus are asexual, and in many hybrid populations most of the individuals are genetically identical , it is conceivable that a lack of genetic diversity limits the hybrids to a subset of the lakes in which the parental species are able to survive.
20957232:14	Alternatively, the hybrids might be generalists and can coexist with the parentals regardless of a given lake's physical or chemical characteristics.
20957232:15	Also, it is important that the hybrid clones are able to solicit sperm from a parental species male.
20957232:16	It may be that a given hybrid clone can solicit sperm from only one parental species.
20957232:17	Alternatively, a single clone may be able to solicit sperm from, and hence coexist with, either parental species.
20957232:18	There is evidence that the hybrids do have a “general purpose” clonal genotype with respect to their ecological niche and there may be important ecological differences between the hybrids and parental species .
20957232:19	The existence of hybrid Phoxinus was not widely known until recently and many existing sampling records of Phoxinus do not mention any hybrids.
20957232:20	Many museum collections of P. eos and P. neogaeus are actually misidentified hybrids (J.A.M.
20957232:21	personal observations of collections from the University of British Columbia Fish Museum and the New Brunswick Museum).
20957232:22	As such, we have little information about the existence of hybrids in lakes over most of the range of P. eos and P. neogaeus .
20957232:23	An inventory of fish species in Algonquin Park, Ontario, completed in 1991 did include hybrid Phoxinus and this inventory provides an opportunity to study the determinants of the distribution of hybrid Phoxinus over a broad range (147 lakes containing Phoxinus over more than 7700 km 2).
20957232:24	In the present study, we compare the distribution of hybrids to that of parental Phoxinus and relative to physical and chemical characteristics of lakes in Algonquin Park, Ontario.
20957232:25	This comparison of the distributions of hybrid and parental Phoxinus was intended to address the hypothesis that, over the range of lakes and habitats sampled in Algonquin Park, hybrids and parental species should be constrained to particular, and perhaps different, physiochemical environments.
20957232:26	Materials and Methods 
Data on the distribution of hybrid Phoxinus and parental species in Algonquin Park were obtained from a database of collections housed at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM).
20957232:27	Algonquin Park covers an area of 7725 km 2 and encompasses the headwaters of five major watersheds flowing into both the Ottawa River and the Great Lakes.
20957232:28	The ROM collection was compiled from an inventory of fish species in Algonquin Park from 1989 to 1991.
20957232:29	Sampling for the Algonquin Park inventory was conducted between May and August.
20957232:30	A single voucher specimen of each species (including the hybrid “species” and both parental Phoxinus species) found in each lake was retained for the ROM collection.
20957232:31	Phoxinus eos were identified by the presence of a narrow, sharply-defined lateral stripe, a distinct supralateral stripe that is often solid at the anterior end and broken at the posterior end, a small, narrow, upturned mouth (usually not reaching beyond the anterior margin of the eye), and a highly coiled, narrow gut , . Phoxinus neogaeus were identified by the presence of a broad, diffuse lateral stripe, the absence of a supralateral stripe, a large, wide, horizontal mouth (often reaching beyond the middle of the eye), and a simple S-shaped, broad gut , . Hybrids were differentiated from parental Phoxinus species by the presence of an intermittent second lateral stripe, intermediate mouth size, and intermediate gut coiling , . We note that, in other studies, Phoxinus with intermediate morphology have been positively identified as hybrids using the genetic techniques of Binet and Angers . There is, however, no guarantee that the characters used would have always accurately differentiated hybrid and parental Phoxinus . Nonetheless, there is no expectation that misidentification would be biased in any way.
20957232:32	The collectors were aware of the presence of hybrids in these lakes and would have been just as likely to mistake a hybrid for a parental as vice versa . 
There are 147 lakes in the ROM database that contained at least one of P. eos P. neogaeus or hybrids.
20957232:33	Although the ROM database represents neither a comprehensive nor a random sample of Algonquin Park lakes, there is no reason to think that the sampling should bias the presence or absence of hybrids or parental species among lakes in the database.
20957232:34	Sampling gear varied between lakes, but not in a systematic way, and detectability of hybrid and parental Phoxinus should not differ with different sampling gear – when Phoxinus species do coexist in a lake, they shoal together and are usually caught together.
20957232:35	Phoxinus catch rate at a given site within a given lake does not appear to vary seasonally from May through November (JAM, personal observation), and there is good evidence that Phoxinus do not stray much from a given site within a lake, even from year to year . We note that there must have been some lakes where the collectors failed to catch particular species or failed to keep voucher specimens representative of all the species caught in a given lake.
20957232:36	The presence of error in the dataset, however, does not preclude an analysis using this dataset.
20957232:37	We had no a priori reason to think that the degree of error in the ROM dataset would prevent us from detecting any real patterns based on the presence or absence of these species.
20957232:38	Fisher's exact test was used to determine whether the presences of hybrids and parental species were correlated.
20957232:39	There were four lakes in the ROM dataset where only hybrids were found.
20957232:40	Since hybrid reproduction requires the involvement of a parental male, the absence of both parental species must reflect the collectors' inability to capture a parental species in these four lakes.
20957232:41	We use this to calculate a rough estimate of the rate of false absences in the dataset.
20957232:42	The ratio of lakes with P. eos (129 lakes) to those with P. neogaeus (23 lakes) was 5.6∶1, and this ratio ought not to have been affected by false absences in the dataset unless the rate of false absences was not equal among Phoxinus species (which is unlikely).
20957232:43	The closest approximation of this 5.6∶1 ratio of P. eos to P. neogaeus with at least one parental species added to each of the four lakes without any parental species, is achieved if we assume all four of the lakes contained P. eos and one of the lakes contained P. neogaeus .
20957232:44	This brings the total number of hybrid-containing lakes also expected to contain P. eos and P. neogaeus to 45 and 10, respectively.
20957232:45	Since P. eos was absent from 4 of the 45 lakes with hybrids where it was expected to occur (8.9% rate of false absences), and P. neogaeus was absent from 1 of the 10 lakes with hybrids where it was expected to occur (10% rate of false absences), the rate of false absences in the dataset was estimated to be, on average, 9.4%.
20957232:46	Data on physical and chemical characteristics of the sampled lakes in the ROM survey were obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and the Ministry of the Environment (MOE).
20957232:47	Eight variables were taken from the MNR and MOE data sets: surface area, maximum depth, elevation, pH, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon concentration, calcium concentration, and SO 4 concentration.
20957232:48	The pH, conductivity, and chemical concentration data were collected in surveys conducted from June to November (mostly October and November) from 1981 and 1992.
20957232:49	Data for other physical variables were taken from a variety of surveys conducted from 1936 to 1992.
20957232:50	It is important to note that the years over which the fish sampling for the ROM database was conducted coincide quite closely with years when the water chemistry variables were measured.
20957232:51	Although the water chemistry data are based on a measurement at a single time point and do not reflect seasonal variation, they are, nonetheless, useful for identifying general differences in water chemistry between lakes .
20957232:52	It is unlikely that any anthropogenic disturbance would have affected the water chemistry of the lakes in Algonquin Park between the time of water chemistry sampling and the ROM fish inventory.
20957232:53	Ever since the early 1970's, strict forestry management guidelines have required that hundreds of meters of buffer be left between forestry operations and any lake or mapped stream (M. S. Ridgway, personal communication, 2010).
20957232:54	Some of the data for surface area, maximum depth, and elevation were collected many years prior to the fish sampling, but these characteristics are unlikely to have changed in the intervening years.
20957232:55	In total, 70 lakes had no missing physiochemical data and were used in the analysis.
20957232:56	Of these 70 lakes, 24 contained hybrids, 9 contained P. neogaeus and all contained P. eos . So, while we were able to evaluate the physiochemical characteristics associated with hybrid and P. neogaeus presence or absence, we were unable to evaluate the characteristics associated with P. eos presence or absence due to a lack of P. eos absences.
20957232:57	A discriminant function analysis (DFA) conducted using the R programming language was used to determine whether either P. neogaeus or hybrid Phoxinus tend to be restricted to a subset of lakes with particular physical or chemical characteristics.
20957232:58	A DFA essentially uses the input variables (i.e., the physiochemical variables) to construct a model that predicts the membership of each lake into one of two groups (e.g., lakes where a particular species was present or absent).
20957232:59	Since unequal group sizes will lead to an overestimation of the ability of the DFA model to predict which lakes belong in which group (because lakes from the largest group are likely to be classified into the largest group by chance alone), Cohen's kappa statistic (K) , was used to evaluate how well the DFA model performed in predicting group membership.
20957232:60	Cohen's kappa gives the chance-corrected proportion of lakes correctly classified by the DFA model.
20957232:61	The probability that K is significantly greater than zero was evaluated using a Z statistic.
20957232:62	Wilks' lambda was then used as a test statistic to evaluate whether differences in physiochemical characteristics were associated with species presence or absence.
20957232:63	Results 
Hybrid Phoxinus were found in 9 of the 27 lakes with both P. eos and P. neogaeus none of the 5 lakes with only P. neogaeus and 32 of the 111 lakes with only P. eos . The estimated rate of false absences in the dataset (9.4%) predicts 14 false P. eos absences, 3 false P. neogaeus absences, and 4 false hybrid absences.
20957232:64	It is possible to correct for these false absences in such a way that maximizes either a negative or positive correlation between the presences of species.
20957232:65	There was no significant correlation between the presences of hybrids and P. eos.
20957232:66	Accounting for the potential false absences in the dataset allows the possibility that the presences of hybrids and P. eos were either positively or negatively correlated (maximum negative correlation: odds ratio  = 0, p<0.001; maximum positive correlation: odds ratio  =  infinite, p<0.001).
20957232:67	There was also no significant correlation between the presences of hybrids and P. neogaeus regardless of how the false absences are accounted for (maximum negative correlation: odds ratio  = 0.63, p = 0.3104;
20957232:68	maximum positive correlation: odds ratio  = 2.01, p = 0.0999).
20957232:69	There was a negative correlation between the presences of P. eos and P. neogaeus (odds ratio  = 0.20, p = 0.0238), and accounting for false absences allows only the possibility of a negative correlation (maximum negative correlation: odds ratio  = 0, p<0.001; maximum positive correlation: odds ratio  =  infinite, p = 0.5728).
20957232:70	There was a significant association between physiochemical characteristics and the presence of P. neogaeus (DFA: df  = 68, Wilks' lambda  = 0.7811,
20957232:71	p = 0.04551)( ), and the DFA model reliably predicted group membership despite different group sizes (df  = 68, K = 0.4656,
20957232:72	Z = 1.702, p = 0.0446).
20957232:73	Lakes containing P. neogaeus tended to be larger and shallower, and have a lower elevation, higher pH, greater conductivity, higher dissolved organic carbon content, higher calcium concentration, and higher SO 4 concentration.
20957232:74	In contrast, there was no association between physiochemical lake characteristics and the presence hybrid Phoxinus (DFA; df  = 68, Wilks' lambda  = 0.9507,
20957232:75	p = 0.9192)( ).
20957232:76	We assume that our low estimated numbers of false absences in the subset of data used for the DFA analysis (1 for P. neogaeus and 2 for hybrids, based on a 9.4% rate of false absences) is unlikely to bias our results.
20957232:77	Discussion 
Hybrid Phoxinus which are sperm-dependent asexuals, are widely distributed in Algonquin Park.
20957232:78	The presence of hybrids in particular lakes was not correlated with the presence of a particular parental species.
20957232:79	This observation suggests that the hybrids in Algonquin Park are generalists with respect to which parental species they use as a sperm donor.
20957232:80	Also, the presence of hybrids was not correlated with the physiochemical characteristics of the lakes sampled in Algonquin Park.
20957232:81	There was a significant negative correlation between the presences of the two parental species, P. neogaeus and P. eos and there was a significant correlation between physiochemical lake characteristics and the presence of P. neogaeus . Assuming that these correlations are reflective of the known ecological differences (that are reflective of morphological differences) between P. eos and P. neogaeus and that the distribution of P. neogaeus is limited by physiochemical factors, the lack of correlation between the presence of hybrids and physiochemical lake characteristics suggests that the hybrids in Algonquin Park are ecological generalists relative to the parental species.
20957232:82	Schlosser et al. also found evidence that hybrid Phoxinus are generalists relative to the ecological niches of the parental species.
20957232:83	The abundances of hybrid and parental Phoxinus from five adjacent drainages flowing into Lake Kabetogama along an 18 km stretch of shoreline in northern Minnesota suggested that all Phoxinus preferred the most oxygenated habitats . The frequency of hybrids relative to the parental species was highest in habitats with lower oxygen concentration (i.e., more marginal habitats) . The hybrids were also shown to survive longer than either parental species when held in very low or negligible oxygen concentrations suggesting that the hybrids are ecological generalists relative to the parental species, at least in terms of tolerance for low oxygen concentration.
20957232:84	Schlosser et al. also found that the hybrids were intermediate between the two parental species in their trophic morphology.
20957232:85	Phoxinus eos has a long and coiled intestine, a small mouth, a short narrow head, and a single row of slender pharyngeal teeth, while P. neogaeus has a short and relatively straight intestine, a large mouth, a long wide head, robust pharyngeal teeth, and a second row of two teeth on their pharyngeal jaw , , . Hybrids are essentially intermediate in all these morphological characters , .
20957232:86	It has been shown, for the parental species at least, that this variation in trophic morphology is reflected in the diets of these fish – P. eos consumed more plant matter and algae and fewer macroinvertebrates than P. neogaeus . No investigation of the diet of hybrid Phoxinus has been published, but it is reasonable to predict that, given their intermediate trophic morphology, the composition of the hybrids' diet would overlap with both parental species.
20957232:87	It should be noted that an implicit assumption in the present study is that there are no other lake characteristics (i.e., physiochemical characteristics not included in the analysis) that are relevant to Phoxinus distribution.
20957232:88	It would be desirable to have a more complete data set with more lakes for which a larger suite of physiochemical variables has been measured.
20957232:89	The present analysis is limited to eight abiotic variables, but an analysis with twice as many variables would also be limited to a certain degree.
20957232:90	We must acknowledge, however, that we may have neglected a particular variable, or suite of variables, that differentiates the ecological niches of hybrid and parental Phoxinus .
20957232:91	It is also possible that the range of values for the variables in the present analysis (i.e., within Algonquin Park) is small relative to the range throughout the distribution of Phoxinus . Important habitat differentiation may be affecting hybrid Phoxinus distribution at a larger scale.
20957232:92	There was a difference in the characteristics of the lakes that tended to be inhabited by the two parental Phoxinus species in Algonquin Park, and this difference may be reflective of the ecological differences between the parental species described above.
20957232:93	It is possible, however, that the P. neogaeus distribution is the result of a lower dispersal ability relative to P. eos or later arrival following post-glacial dispersal, both of which might explain why P. neogaeus is found primarily in lower elevation lakes with the physiochemical characteristics of such lakes.
20957232:94	The fact that P. neogaeus is found in far fewer lakes than P. eos supports the hypothesis that their distribution is limited primarily by dispersal and colonization ability rather than by environmental factors.
20957232:95	Dispersal and colonization ability may also account for the limited distribution of hybrids relative to P. eos . Hybrids are only able to colonize a lake after one of the parental species has arrived.
20957232:96	Unlike P. neogaeus however, there is no indication that the hybrids' ability to colonize a lake is limited by the physiochemical characteristics of that lake.
20957232:97	An analysis of the combined influence on Phoxinus distribution of post-glacial dispersal distance and elevation would provide valuable insight into species coexistences in this system.
20957232:98	It is intriguing that no hybrid Phoxinus were found in lakes without P. eos which may suggest that hybrid lineages in Algonquin Park are unable to solicit sperm from P. neogaeus males.
20957232:99	There were, however, only 4 lakes with P. neogaeus that did not contain P. eos which provides insufficient statistical power to draw inferences from the lack of hybrids in such cases.
20957232:100	Also, hybrids were found in 9 lakes with both P. neogaeus and P. eos and it remains unclear which parental species acts as the sperm-donor in those lakes.
20957232:101	We are, therefore, limited in our ability to conclude that hybrid lineages in Algonquin Park are adapted to preferentially coexist with either parental species.
20957232:102	The reasons why sex is maintained as the dominant reproductive mode in vertebrates likely have to do with the rarity with which reversions to asexuality occur and with limits on the persistence of asexual lineages once they arise.
20957232:103	In the present study, no limitations on the distribution of hybrid Phoxinus were detected.
20957232:104	This may suggest that asexual reproduction is a successful strategy in this system (as opposed to most other vertebrate systems) because asexuals are able to survive and persist wherever their sperm donors are, regardless of the general physiochemical characteristics of their habitat, and likely regardless of which sperm donor is present.
20957232:105	Further studies on the mechanisms allowing the persistence of both asexual and sexual Phoxinus across their range, especially concerning the ability of hybrids to solicit and successfully use sperm from the two parental species, are certainly warranted.
15189569:0	Background 
The defensive withdrawal reflex of Aplysia affords a model of classical conditioning.
15189569:1	This involves a conditioned stimulus (touching the siphon) and an unconditioned stimulus (shocking the tail), and has been interpreted in terms of the integration of two separate simultaneous signals in the same motor neuron: Ca ++ and Gαs -GTP . Genetic analysis in Drosophila showed that a mutant of learning and memory, rutabaga has a defect in the gene coding for an isoform of adenylyl cyclase (type II), which is regulated by both Ca++ and Gα s . This mutant shows low and unregulated levels of cAMP.
15189569:2	Paradoxically, elevation of cAMP levels in dnc mutants (defect in the cAMP phosphodiesterase gene) causes an identical learning and memory deficit.
15189569:3	The strongest phenotype comes from an allele that increases the cAMP level to as much as eight times normal [ - ].
15189569:4	Moreover, the double mutant dnc/rut has a normal cAMP level but still shows a learning and memory deficit, which suggests that these behavioral defects depend on failure to regulate cAMP levels . Studies of these molecules in mutants and/or transgenic animals have led to an accumulation of interesting data in behavioral analysis of memory, learning and associative competence . Moreover and surprisingly, it has been demonstrated that a high level of cAMP also follows the simultaneous activation of Gi by GABA and G s by isoproterenol in rat neurons, whose combined (opposing) effects were expected to restore the basal cAMP level [ - ].
15189569:5	Biochemical analysis has revealed the role of adenylyl cyclase type II in this phenomenon, which is highly active when complexed with both beta/gamma and Gαs . Interestingly, beta/gamma in such complexes comes from the Gi component [ , ].
15189569:6	Six beta and 13 gamma isoforms and a large family of cyclase isoforms have been cloned [ - ], which suggests that only specific combinations might be involved in coincidental signaling.
15189569:7	Molecules that act as detectors of coincidental signals allow us to understand how the topology of the synaptic network influences its biochemistry.
15189569:8	Our analysis of the molecular components involved in simultaneous GABA/ isoproterenol signaling has been facilitated by previously reported data on the role of beta4/gamma2 and beta1/gamma2 in the activation of cyclase type II . In the present study we investigated whether beta/gamma might influence the GTPase activity of Gαs when beta/gamma Gαs and cyclase are associated in a complex form and conversely, whether G αs pre-associated with a cyclase, might increase the affinity of beta/gamma for this complex.
15189569:9	Results 
Discussion 
Adenylyl cyclases contain two conserved homologous cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2) that form the catalytic core of the enzyme . Forskolin appears to induce the assembly of these two domains by interacting with the catalytic cleft [ - ].
15189569:10	The affinity between C1 and C2 is also facilitated by Gα s binding.
15189569:11	These data have been confirmed by the finding that Forskolin and Gα s stimulate synergistically the cyclase activity . In the presence of Gαs the affinity of Forskolin for the dimer C1/C2 is high (K d = 0.1 μM), which suggests a stronger affinity for the complete cyclase molecule .
15189569:12	The site of interaction of the cyclase (type I or II) for beta/gamma has been located in the C1 b region.
15189569:13	This site is independent of the Gαs and Forskolin interaction domains.
15189569:14	These findings argue in favor of isolating the cyclase(s) and its associated proteins using Forskolin-agarose affinity chromatography although this procedure enriches indistinctly the different isoforms of the cyclase family.
15189569:15	The authors who described this method  reported that the complex could be dissociated with high salt concentrations in order to purify the cyclase(s).
15189569:16	Our 'pull down' material is heterogeneous because this isolation procedure does not discriminate between the different isotypes of cyclase.
15189569:17	Furthermore, Gαs recognizes all the isoforms of adenylate cyclase whereas the association Gbeta /cyclase is limited to two isotypes (type I and II) which share similar features.
15189569:18	Consequently, this mismatch makes the comparison of Gαs/G beta precipitated in the cyclase 'pull down' difficult.
15189569:19	Inconstant data were observed in experiments of kinetics where both molecules were quantified on the same gel.
15189569:20	On the other hand, Gαs-GTP in the Gαs/cyclase(s) complex might have a Kcat for the hydrolysis of bound GTP different from one isoform of cyclase to another.
15189569:21	The heterogeneity of cyclases in the 'pull down' makes the analysis of co-associated Gαs uncertain, specially if we aim to parallel the dynamics of association/dissociation of G beta and Gαs.
15189569:22	Furthermore, our analysis might be hampered by variable elution/retention of components from the affinity column and the yield of their isolation from crude membranes.
15189569:23	These limitations are difficult to assess.
15189569:24	On the other hand, the drastic increase of cAMP synthesis by simultaneous Gi / Gs activation finely analyzed in rat hippocampus  is known to be attributable to the type II isoform . Type I is also regulated by beta/gamma and Gαs but here beta/gamma is inhibitory.
15189569:25	High concentrations of beta/gamma do not eliminate the cyclase type I activity induced by Gαs, but stabilize it at intermediate levels, which suggests that the conformation of cyclase type I is rearranged by association with beta/gamma . The two isoforms show similar affinities for beta/gamma (half-maximal effect about 5 nM) . We postulate therefore that the molecular events described in this report mostly highlight the relevance of cyclase type II, despite isotype I contamination.
15189569:26	We might also speculate that the intra-complex regulatory mechanisms described here have the same characteristics for both isotypes, although they induce opposite effects on cyclase activity.
15189569:27	Furthermore, we carried out our experiments with intact membranes, in order to preserve the architecture of the multiple associated proteins that might be relevant to the biochemistry involved in coincidental phenomenon.
15189569:28	For example, regulators of G proteins (RGS) interact mostly with the Gα subunit of Gi/o/q by accelerating their intrinsic GTPase activity, which alters the amplitude of the effect of a stimulated receptor . Each member of this large family of genes (16 isotypes have been described) displays differential selectivity for these G proteins .
15189569:29	Interestingly, RGS 14 and 12 are unique in that they inhibit the guanine nucleotide exchange of Gi in addition to their GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity.
15189569:30	A recent report shows that PKA phosphorylation of RGS 14 increases the inhibition of nucleotide exchange 3-fold, thereby increasing the binding Gi /GDP and consequently limiting the interactions of Gi with effectors . RGS 14 is expressed in brain , which might be of interest in relation to our work.
15189569:31	By increasing PKA activity, high cAMP concentrations should inhibit more Gi molecules enhancing the effect of the simultaneous stimulation ( Gαs and Gbeta ) of cyclase type II.
15189569:32	After a while beta/gamma would then be captured by Gi /GDP, ending the simultaneous stimulation of cyclase type II by a retro-control loop.
15189569:33	In this report, we have investigated whether beta/gamma bound to cyclase(s) might influence the rate of GTP hydrolysis of Gαs or conversely whether Gαs bound to cyclase(s) might modify its affinity for beta/gamma . We found that the GTPase activity of Gαs coupled to the cyclase(s) complex decreases when beta adrenergic and GABA receptors are simultaneously stimulated.
15189569:34	We also demonstrated that the affinity of beta/gamma (from Gi ) for the cyclase(s) is increased when the latter is associated with GTP-Gαs . Our data strongly suggest that simultaneous application of stimuli, which individually exert opposing effects on the levels of second messengers, triggers specific kinetics of protein association and enzyme catalysis.
15189569:35	This highlights the paradoxically high level of cAMP obtained by simultaneous GABA / beta adrenergic receptor activation.
15189569:36	Adenylate cyclase was reported to function as a GTPase activating protein for Gαs . Our data support the idea that beta/gamma from [GABA]b receptor-coupled Gi retards the GTPase activity of adrenergic receptor-coupled Gαs when these molecules are complexed with adenylyl cyclase isoforms.
15189569:37	Conclusions 
Cyclases are not the only molecules to be regulated ' à la carte ' by simultaneous signaling.
15189569:38	Various molecules in different tissues correspond to the definition of 'detectors of simultaneity': for example, muscle phosphorylase kinase, a tetramer constituted of a catalytic subunit, two cAMP dependent regulatory subunits and calmodulin.
15189569:39	Two stimuli (Ca++ and cAMP) synergistically stimulate phosphorylase kinase activity . Furthermore, some molecules fine-tune their activities, depending on the local context, in 'reading' the temporal order of their regulatory signals.
15189569:40	For example, phosphatase I is associated with a potent protein inhibitor: this inhibitor has a site that is phosphorylated by caseine kinase I.
15189569:41	This phosphorylation protects an adjacent phosphorylated site from calcineurin and consequently these two phospho sites in the inhibitor controls the activity of the phosphatase . Another example is the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
15189569:42	This enzyme has two major phosphorylation sites, which have opposite functions.
15189569:43	One, phosphorylated by PKA, stimulates the enzyme activity, the other, phosphorylated by PKC, inhibits it.
15189569:44	Interestingly, PKA and/or PKC phosphorylation of one site induces dephosphorylation of the other.
15189569:45	Two phosphatases associated with eNOS have one or the other phosphorylated site as specific substrate.
15189569:46	When one phosphatase is active the other is inactive . All these coordinated controls display different modes used by key molecules acting as sensors of multiple converging second messengers.
15189569:47	Specific molecular events induced by simultaneous signals and/or sequentially ordered signals imply interactions of components in a large complex.
15189569:48	This seems the essential paradigm of synaptic function.

20631901:1	Introduction 

				Cutaneous melanoma (CM) has shown to be one of the life-threatening malignancies with the fastest rise in incidence over the last decades.
20631901:2	The highest incidence of CM is observed in Australia (60–70 per 100.000
20631901:3	individuals).
20631901:4	In Europe and the USA the incidence is lower (10–15 and 20–30 per 100.000 , resp.).
20631901:5	CM accounts for more than 90% of all melanomas , whereas uveal melanoma (UM) is only encountered in 5% . Nevertheless, UM is the most frequently occurring intraocular malignancy (85%) in the western world.
20631901:6	Although CM and UM both derive from melanocytes, these two distinct tumors show remarkable differences in tumorigenesis, mode of metastatic spread, genetic alterations, and therapeutic response . CM can occur anywhere on the body but is predominantly observed in sun-exposed body parts.
20631901:7	This partly explains the high incidence of CM in the light-skinned residents of Australia and New-Zealand.
20631901:8	UM can occur anywhere along the uveal tract but tend to occur more frequently in the choroid (80%) and the ciliary body (15%).
20631901:9	The incidence of UM appears to be relatively stable with around 7 new patients per 1 million individuals yearly in the western world.
20631901:10	UV-light exposure has shown not to be of specific risk in UM.
20631901:11	However recently, Schmidt et al.  demonstrated a positive interaction between UM and individuals with light colored eyes who sustained frequent UV-radiation.
20631901:12	In addition, the tendency of iris melanomas to occur in the lower half of the iris has been explained by the increased sunlight exposure of this area .
20631901:13	Other known risk factors for CM and UM are fair skin type (CM and UM), familial occurrence of melanoma (CM) , number of melanocytic naevi (CM), light colored eyes (UM), and oculodermal melanocytosis (UM) .

20631901:14	Diagnostics 
Clinical examination of suspicious lesions remains an important modality in diagnosing CM and UM.
20631901:15	As for the diagnosis in CM, dermatologists rely mostly on clinical examination and reserve (excisional) biopsy for tumors of uncertain origin.
20631901:16	Only UM of the iris can be diagnosed by external examination and is therefore detected in an early stage.
20631901:17	For detection of UM of the choroid or ciliary body, a thorough ophthalmic examination including indirect ophthalmoscopy and ultrasonography of the retina has to be conducted.
20631901:18	Tumor growth can lead to retinal detachment and result in extraocular extension of the tumor.
20631901:19	At this point, defects in visual field or central vision may be present.
20631901:20	Early symptoms of tumor growth, however, can be vague or absent to the patients' notion.
20631901:21	The overall survival is known to be dependent of the tumor thickness (CM) and largest tumor diameter (UM) at time of diagnosis.
20631901:22	Therefore, clinicians still concentrate on early detection of CM and UM.
20631901:23	This resulted in an average tumor thickness of 0.76 mm in CM at time of diagnosis nowadays.
20631901:24	This was shown to relate to an overall 10-year survival of 90%  of these small lesions.
20631901:25	Similarly, UMs with a diameter of under 4 mm relate to a 5-year survival of 84%.
20631901:26	The 5-year survival rate for medium-sized UM (4–8 mm in diameter) is 68%, and 47% with large size UM (over 8 mm in diameter) . The survival of CM and UM patients with metastatic disease is however equally bad with a dismal mean of 2–7 months  . 
3.
20631901:27	Therapy 
The most frequently used therapeutic option in CM is excision of the primary tumor and enucleation of the tumor containing eye in case of large UM.
20631901:28	Most small and medium-sized UMs are currently managed by eye-saving treatments such as observation (small inactive tumors), episcleral brachytherapy or charged-particle radiotherapy, and several other variants of radiotherapy.
20631901:29	In CM, radiotherapy is only used for palliative purposes as CM cells appear to be relatively radio-resistant.
20631901:30	Adjuvant systemic therapy is mainly used in patients at high-risk of metastasis or in patients who already have developed metastasis.
20631901:31	The response rates of chemotherapeutic agents in metastasized CM and UM are however as low as 7%–25%  . 
4.
20631901:32	Metastasis 
Both malignancies display a strong tendency to metastasize .
20631901:33	Although the mode of metastatic spread is different, CMs tend to metastasize by both hematogenous and lymphogenous route and local invasion.
20631901:34	CMs are known to be able to give rise to metastases in skin (13%–38%), distant lymph nodes (5%–34%), distant subcutaneous tissues (32%), lung (18%–36%), liver (14%–20%), CNS (2%–20%), and/or bone (4%–17%) . In UM, metastatic spread is almost exclusively by hematogenous route to remote organs of which the liver is involved in almost all cases (90%) . The reason why UM is not involved in metastatic spread by lymphogenous route is thought to be a direct result of the absence of draining lymphatics of the eye .
20631901:35	It is however still unknown why the liver is especially affected by metastases although there are reports about sporadic metastases in lung (24%) and bone (16%)  . 
Eventually 45% of UM patients die of metastasis regardless of enucleation or radiotherapy .
20631901:36	This has led to theories about the early presence of micrometastasis in the disease process, which remain dormant for years before they give rise to clinically detectable macrometastasis . The exact duration of this proposed state of dormancy and cues for metastatic development remains uncertain.
20631901:37	Shields et al.  reported tumors with a size of just 1.0 mm to be capable of metastasizing, hence the need for highly specific and sensitive prognostic markers to predict which patient is at risk of developing metastasis.
20631901:38	In the quest for significant prognostic markers in UM, already several have been identified.
20631901:39	Age (over 60 years), largest basal tumor diameter (over 18 mm), tumor cell type (epitheloid cellularity), and closed vascular patterns correlate with early metastatic disease and shorter survival  . In CM, tumor thickness (increasing Breslow thicknesses), level of invasion, age (old age), gender (males), anatomic site of primary tumor (head/neck or trunk), number of metastatic lymph nodes, and ulceration on histopathological research appeared to be independent significant prognostic factors of early metastasis . These factors are summarized in a staging system known as the TNM-staging system.
20631901:40	This system relies on tumor stage at time of diagnosis which has shown to be the most important prognostic factor in CM and is now widely used for prognostic purposes and clinical decision making . 
5. Tumor Research Methods 
Genetic analysis of tumor material, either from excised CM or from enucleated eyes, has led to the identification of genetic prognostic markers for both types of melanoma.
20631901:41	In the past years several cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques have been used to investigate the genomic background of melanomas.
20631901:42	With conventional karyotyping, we and others were able to identify chromosomal gains, losses, and translocations in UM.
20631901:43	Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) allows a complete copy number analysis of the entire genome by comparative hybridization of differentially labelled genomic sample and reference DNA to normal human metaphase spreads.
20631901:44	Both these techniques have a low resolution of 5–20 MB.
20631901:45	Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH) provides a higher test resolution and even clonal gains and losses present in only a low percentage of tumor cells can be detected . Furthermore, FISH has high test specificity, and although time consuming, still it is a frequently used technique in tumor research and diagnostics.
20631901:46	Also paraffin-embedded tissue sections can be assayed by FISH.
20631901:47	A drawback to this technique, however, is that only a small number of loci can be analyzed in one single experiment.
20631901:48	Molecular genetic techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and microsatellite instability analysis (MSI) require input of isolated DNA and enable analysis of multiple loci in one experiment with a high resolution.
20631901:49	MLPA is a polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-) based technique which functions through the simultaneous hybridization of multiple (up to 50) probes to tumor DNA.
20631901:50	Each probe with unique length is only amplified when ligated to its unique probe-counterpart.
20631901:51	This provides high specificity of hybridized probes.
20631901:52	The final amount of DNA, after several PCR-cycles, is dependent of its initial quantity and eventually copy number changes can be quantitated by relative quantification (RQ).
20631901:53	MLPA has proven to be a suitable test for detection of chromosomal anomalies in tumor material . 
For loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, MSI is frequently used.
20631901:54	With this technique, specific markers are required which are allowed to hybridize to the so-called microsatellites within genomic intronic DNA.
20631901:55	These microsatellites are tandem repeats of simple polymorphic sequences that are randomly distributed and allow detection of the presence or absence of two different alleles.
20631901:56	A drawback to this technique is that only a limited number of markers can be analyzed in a single experiment.
20631901:57	Microarray-based CGH, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and gene expression analysis are among the most frequently applied array-based techniques nowadays.
20631901:58	All these techniques are based on series of DNA segments (oligonucleotides or bacterial artificial chromosomes; BACs) orderly arranged on a chip, to which fluorescently labeled DNA or RNA can be hybridized.
20631901:59	This enables the analysis of copy number status or gene expression of one entire genome very rapidly.
20631901:60	Nowadays, there are chips available which enable analysis of structural variation at high level of detail with up to 1.2 million markers.
20631901:61	The use of SNP arrays can also provide evaluation of loss of heterozygosity or isodisomy of parts of the genome.
20631901:62	Drawbacks to array technology are its cost, which is about tenfold compared to FISH, and the inability to detect balanced anomalies and genomic abnormalities in frequencies below 10% of analyzed nuclei.
20631901:63	provides an overview of the differences in resolution and detection limits among the cytogenetic and array-based techniques.
20631901:64	The different research techniques previously mentioned certainly contributed to our understanding of melanoma by identification of chromosomes and genes involved in the disease.
20631901:65	In the following section we will discuss the most important chromosomal and genetic alterations UM and CM.
20631901:66	6. Chromosomal Aberrations in UM 
7. Chromosomal Aberrations in CM 
CMs display a more complex karyotype compared to UM.
20631901:67	The most frequently observed chromosomal aberration in CM is monosomy 10.
20631901:68	This aberration is found in approximately 60% of CM cases and appears to be significantly more frequent compared to UM, where monosomy 10 is found in 27% of cases . Because monosomy 10 could include loss of tumor suppressor genes, much research has been aimed at identifying possible tumor suppressor genes involved.
20631901:69	Phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) is one of the identified tumor suppressor genes, located on 10q23, with strong evidence for a role in CM tumorigenesis . PTEN is thought to be inactivated by deletion or mutation and through loss of its negative regulatory effect on AKT, lead to activation of the AKT-pathway, and consequently prevent apoptosis .
20631901:70	The actual inactivation of PTEN is observed in up to 30%–40% of CM cell lines , but only in 10% of primary CMs.
20631901:71	PTEN inactivation or downregulation is mainly found in tumors with an increase in aneuploidy, suggesting that it is a late event in tumor progression . In UM, inactivation of PTEN is reported in 15% of cases and has been linked to an increase in aneuploidy but also poor clinical outcome . 
The other frequently reported chromosomal aberrations involved in CM are −1p, +1q, −4, −5, −6q, +7, −9p, −11q, −12q, −14, −15, −16, −17p, +18, +20, −21, and −22 . Some of them will be discussed here along with the most well-known genes, involved in tumorigenesis and/ or metastatic development.
20631901:72	8.
20631901:73	Epigenetics 
Over the last years, there have been growing interest for the role of epigenetics in CM and UM pathogenesis and metastasis.
20631901:74	The most well-known epigenetic features are methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs).
20631901:75	Both act through different mechanisms by which they are thought to alter normal gene transcription.
20631901:76	Methylation is frequently reported to induce silencing of certain genes by direct methylation of DNA strands or hypermethylation of specific promoters.
20631901:77	Because human cancers are theorized to cause global demethylation and promoter hypermethylation, it is thought that this could lead to activation of imprinted genes and the inactivation of genes . In CM, several genes commonly hypermethylated have been identified such as RASSF 1A APC, PYCARD, RARB, MGMT, DAPK, 3- OST -2 HOXB 13 SYK, TIMP 3A CDKN 2A FHIT, SOCS 1 SOCS 2, and PTEN . In UM, the studies regarding gene/promoter methylation status are still limited but CDKN2 A is found to be methylated in 33% of cases . Similarly, RASSF 1 appears to be methylated in 13%–70%  and hTERT in up to 52% .
20631901:78	It is not certain whether these methylated sites contribute to metastasis.
20631901:79	MiRNAs have recently come to the attention because of their inhibitory effect on translation of mRNAs into proteins.
20631901:80	Although there are limited studies available on the role of miRNAs, several miRNAs have been marked as possibly involved in UM tumorigenesis and/or metastasis such as let-7b miR18a miR-199a miR495 miR549, and more . Worley et al.  and Radhakrishnan et al.  reported differentially expressed sets of miRNAs that could accurately distinguish two different classes with a low- and high- risk potential for metastatic disease.
20631901:81	These miRNAs were shown to bind to genes often found to be deleted in UM such as 8p22, but also 13q and 17p.
20631901:82	In CM, many different miRNAs have been identified such as miR-137 miR-182 miR-221 miR-222, and different subtypes of the let-7 family  .
20631901:83	These are thought to act as important factors in CM tumorigenesis and metastasis; further research is however required to analyse their exact role in CM.
20631901:84	9.
20631901:85	The Relation between CM and UM 
Although there are many differences between CM and UM, they do share some features.
20631901:86	First of all, both tumors derive from neural crest melanocytes which migrated to the epidermic tissue or the eye.
20631901:87	This common origin is still observed on morphologic and gross histopathologic research of tumor material from CM and UM.
20631901:88	The chromosomal regions frequently observed to be amplificated or deleted in both melanotic tumors do resemble each other although the exact frequencies in which they occur differ.
20631901:89	For instance, monosomy 3 is observed in around 50% of UMs and in 25% of CMs.
20631901:90	The same holds for gene expression status: many of the genes found to be frequently overexpressed or underexpressed in CM are also observed in UM.
20631901:91	Furthermore, both tumors are highly metastatic which is illustrated by the early initiation of metastases.
20631901:92	UM, however, is not known to spread by lymphogenous route as CM is.
20631901:93	This is an important difference and possibly due to the anatomical restrictions of the eye and the lymphatic system.
20631901:94	Another difference concerns the role of UV-radiation, which appears to be an important risk factor for the development of CM but is not known as a risk factor for development of choroid-localized UM.
20631901:95	There is however evidence regarding an interaction between UV-radiation and development of UM in the easily to sunlight exposed iris . 
Maybe the two types of melanotic tumors are more similar than previously thought because of its common origin and the differences are merely a result of the exact location of the melanoma and its direct environment.
20631901:96	Each location has its own array of carcinogens to which the tissue is exposed to.
20631901:97	For instance, the retina is less intensely exposed to UV-radiation than the skin.
20631901:98	The epithelial environment the cutaneous melanocytes reside in leads to the cells having more epithelial qualities of which downregulation of the molecule E-cadherin during local invasion is an example.
20631901:99	Uveal melanocytes do not require this “mesenchymal to epithelial transition” because they are not in an epithelial environment.
20631901:100	This could for part explain the differences in the spectrum of mutations between the two types of melanocytic tumors.
20631901:101	10. Conclusion 
Despite all developments in diagnostics and therapeutics of primary UMs in the last 20–30 years, there have been no significant decrease in metastasis-related deaths . The prognosis for patients with metastasized disease still is 2–7 months, regardless of systemic therapy.
20631901:102	This is probably due to the early initiation of metastasis in both CM and UM, which underlines the need for early prognostication.
20631901:103	This could, at least for part, be achieved by continuing the search for prognostic factors in CM and UM through genetic research on tumor material.
20631901:104	Genetic research has showed us that CM and UM have aberrations in common but that these differ in frequency between the two tumors.
20631901:105	Even so, both express many of the same genes but not all.
20631901:106	In CM, alterations of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, and 21 are frequently observed and already several candidate genes and proteins involved in the tumorigenesis of CM have been identified.
20631901:107	UMs were shown to frequently display chromosomal aberrations on chromosomes 1, 3, and 8.
20631901:108	Of these, monosomy 3, gain of 8q, and the combination of loss of 1p36 and monosomy 3 appeared to be significant prognostic factors for decreased survival; There have not been identified genes yet that are prognostically active in UM, and at this point developments in UM lag behind compared to CM.
20631901:109	New insights in UM, however, came about by gene expression profiling of UMs which were shown to cluster naturally in two classes with different prognosis  . Generally, array technology has proven to outperform clinical and histopathological parameters in determining a patients' prognosis.
20631901:110	This led to the frequent usage of gene expression testing in the current clinical setting in an attempt to identify high-risk patients.
20631901:111	We do have to remind that we do not yet know whether monosomy 3 and classifier genes are truly involved in tumor progression and metastatic potential or that those are merely markers of the underlying cause.
20631901:112	Additionally, we have to evaluate whether these results may aid clinicians in assessing eligibility of patients for future (adjuvant) systemic therapies.
20631901:113	Most of the genetic research is conducted on relatively large UMs because small UMs are treated conservatively and this has biased UM research.
20631901:114	Recent groups already reported about the suitability of fine needle aspiration biopsy in harvesting of tumor material from patients treated with eye-saving modalities  . Also for this diagnostic option we have to evaluate whether this will be beneficial for patient care and can lead to predictions about prognosis for the individual patient.
20631901:115	Some genetic markers have already proven its value in predicting prognosis next to clinical and histopathological markers and could lead to selection for patient-tailored therapies in the near future.
20631901:116	Also, the challenge will be to prove or disprove the cost-effectiveness of array technology and find additional genetic markers predictive of worse prognosis in CM and UM patients.
20631901:117	Concluding, much information has been gained by genetic research of melanonomas and further research could augment our knowledge.
20631901:118	Because there are similarities between the two tumors, research on one of two tumors could provide clues for research on the other.
20631901:119	Epigenetics, the whole new field in genetic research, does look like a promising ally in our quest to understanding of pathogenesis and metastasis in CM and UM and might provide us with valuable prognostic information in the near future.

19161603:0	Background 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death throughout the world.
19161603:1	Multistage development of the disease has been associated with remarkable genetic events, mainly at the level of oncogenes and oncosuppressor genes, most notably the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) , ras , and p53 .
19161603:2	Although great advances have been made during the last few decades in understanding the molecular biology of colorectal cancer , the prognosis of patients with this neoplasm has not improved in parallel.
19161603:3	The overall five-year survival rate remains poor (40–45%) .
19161603:4	It can be assumed that several genes involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are still unknown.
19161603:5	Therefore, further elucidation of the molecular biology of colorectal cancer may be useful to devise new methods for the diagnosis and the treatment of the disease.
19161603:6	Several approaches have been taken to identify and compare gene expression in normal and disease states [ - ].
19161603:7	The differential display technique was employed in this study based on its ability to identify both up-regulated genes (putative oncogenes) and down-regulated genes (putative tumor/metastasis suppressor genes) simultaneously.
19161603:8	Differential Display (DD) is a useful method to compare patterns of gene expression in RNA samples of different types or under different biological conditions .
19161603:9	The technique produces partial cDNA fragments by a combination of reverse transcription (RT) and PCR of randomly primed RNA.
19161603:10	Changes in the expression level of genes are identified after separation of the cDNA fragments produced in an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction on a sequencing-type gel.
19161603:11	When combined with real-time quantitative PCR to eliminate false positives, DD becomes a powerful method for generating high confidence hits in the screening of hundreds of potentially differentially expressed transcripts.
19161603:12	A number of genes such as UCC1 , Reg , and PIGR  have been detected by DD-PCR to be associated with colorectal cancer.
19161603:13	In this study, we found that DHX32 a novel RNA helicase, was significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancer compared to its adjacent normal tissue using a combination of DD-PCR and real-time PCR methods.
19161603:14	Our results suggested that the level of DHX32 gene expression in colorectal cancer was significantly associated with cancer location, lymph gland metastasis, cancer nodal status, differentiation grade and Dukes' stage.
19161603:15	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The study of the molecular biology of colorectal cancer has progressed rapidly, but the survival of patients with this neoplasm has improved rather modestly . Consequently, further studies of CRC-related genes would help better understand the tumorigenesis of CRC and develop new methods for population screening, follow-up of treated patients, prognosis, and new therapies of the disease.
19161603:16	In this study, we demonstrated that human DHX32 a novel RNA helicase, was up-regulated in colorectal cancer compared to its adjacent normal tissues.
19161603:17	Furthermore, our results suggested that the level of DHX32 gene expression in colorectal carcinoma was significantly associated with tumor location, lymph gland metastasis, tumor nodal status, differentiation grade, and Dukes' stage.
19161603:18	DHX32 was originally identified as a novel RNA helicase with unique structure in the helicase domain, but with overall similarity to the DHX family of helicases . RNA helicases are enzymes that utilize the energy derived from nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to modulate the structure of RNA molecules and thus potentially influence all biochemical steps involving RNA which at least include transcription, splicing, transport, translation, decay, and ribosome biogenesis . The involvement of RNA molecules in these steps is influenced by their tendency to form secondary structures and by their interaction with other RNA molecules and proteins . DHX32 is composed of 12 exons spanning a 60-kb region at human chromosome 10q26 and encodes for a 743 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 84.4 kDa.
19161603:19	DHX32 has a widespread tissue distribution and also has cross-species counterparts, such as 84 and 80% amino acid identity with mouse and rat counterparts, respectively.
19161603:20	The high level of similarity between human and murine DHX32 and the widespread expression of DHX32 message suggest that it is an evolutionally conserved and functionally important gene.
19161603:21	With a few notable exceptions, the biochemical activities and biological roles of RNA helicases, including DHX32 are not very well characterized.
19161603:22	In our study, we found that DHX32 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer compared with the adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that abnormal expression of DHX32 is associated with the development of colorectal cancer.
19161603:23	The involvement of DHX32 in other cancer development was previously demonstrated by other groups.
19161603:24	For example, the expression of DHX32 was dysregulated in several lymphoid malignancies . DHX32 was reported as anti-sense to another gene, BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A Interacting Protein), and BCCIP was down-regulated in kidney tumors . The overexpression of one of BCCIP isoforms can inhibit tumor growth . 
So far, several groups have attempted to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which DHX32 involves in cancer development, but the exact biochemical activities and biological functions of DHX32 are still elusive.
19161603:25	DHX32 contains sequences which are highly conserved between a subfamily of DEAH RNA helicases, including the yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp43 , and its mammalian ortholog DHX15.
19161603:26	The structural similarity of DHX32 to RNA helicases involved in mRNA splicing suggests a role in pre-mRNA splicing.
19161603:27	It is possible that the dysregulation of the normal function of RNA helicases can potentially result in abnormal RNA processing with deleterious effects on the expression/function of key proteins in normal cell cycles and contribute to cancer development and/or progression.
19161603:28	There are several examples of dyregulation of RNA helicases in cancer , mostly in the forms of overexpression including those of DDX5  and DDX6  which were reported to be overexpressed in colorectal tumor.
19161603:29	Our results indicated that the differential expression of DHX32 in colorectal carcinoma was significantly associated with tumor location, lymph gland metastasis, tumor nodal status, differentiation grade, and Dukes' stage.
19161603:30	These results not only further confirmed the possible critical role of DHX32 in human colorectal development, but also suggested that additional studies may help develop DHX32 as a potential biomarker to judge the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients: the patients with higher gene expression of DHX32 may have worse prognosis.
19161603:31	In conclusion, to our knowledge, we are the first to report the more frequent and significant overexpression of human DHX32 in human CRC than that of the adjacent normal tissue, indicating that overexpression of DHX32 may play a pivotal role in the multistage carcinogenesis of human CRC.
19161603:32	It still remains to be further investigated for the functions of DHX32 during the progression of colorectal cancer.
19161603:33	DHX32 may also serve as a bio-marker for judging the levels of malignancy of colorectal cancer, which may guide the development of anticancer therapy regime after additional studies.
19161603:34	Conclusion 
DHX32 may play an important role in the development of colorectal cancer and additional studies may help use DHX32 as a novel biomarker for colorectal cancer.

10704469:0	Introduction 
Progenitor T cells must go through distinct check points as they differentiate in the thymus before becoming mature T cells . The most immature CD4 −CD8 − (DN) thymocytes can differentiate into CD4 +CD8 + (DP) cells only after the expression of TCR β chains, a process termed β selection .
10704469:1	The DP thymocytes, which subsequently rearrange the TCR α chain genes and express TCR-α/β, are subjected to the positive and negative selection by the specificity of TCR . Only positively selected thymocytes can mature into either CD4 + or CD8 + single positive (SP) T cells.
10704469:2	In the β selection of pre-T cells, the signaling from TCR-β/pre–TCR-α (pTα)–CD3 complex ( ; pre-TCR) is shown to play a crucial role .
10704469:3	Based on the analysis of pTα-deficient mice it is indicated that pre-T cells drastically expand during β selection, which is essential for the subsequent generation of clonal diversification.
10704469:4	However, it remains to be verified whether the β selection process somehow affects the final TCR repertoire of mature T cells.
10704469:5	PD-1 is a 55-kD type I transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily bearing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic region . In the thymus, PD-1 is selectively expressed in a very minor population of DN thymocytes while it is also induced on peripheral T and B cells after activation . Expression of PD-1 in DN thymocytes is significantly augmented in both normal and recombination activating gene (RAG)-2–deficient mice by the injection of anti-CD3 mAb, implying that PD-1 might be involved in the β selection process . Recently, PD-1–deficient mice were found to spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases characterized by lupus-like glomerulonephritis with immune complex deposition and destructive arthritis as they age and it has been suggested that the PD-1 deficiency results in the breakdown of peripheral tolerance against self-reactive T cells . The possibility that the PD-1 deficiency affects the repertoire of mature T cells also remains open . In the present study, we report that the absence of PD-1 significantly facilitates the transition of thymocytes from DN to DP stage in the TCR transgenic lines as well as in RAG-2 −/− mice injected with anti-CD3 mAb, suggesting that PD-1 controls the threshold of β selection.
10704469:6	On the other hand, efficiency of positive selection for the transgenic T cells in the relevant genetic background was significantly reduced in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:7	Mechanisms for the opposing effects of PD-1 deficiency on β and positive selections as well as their possible involvement in the development of lupus-like diseases are discussed.
10704469:8	Materials and Methods 
Results and Discussion 
We have comparatively analyzed the expression of PD-1 in the thymus of normal and various TCR transgenic mice.
10704469:9	As shown in a, PD-1 was expressed in only ∼1% of total thymocytes of normal mice, which was confined to the DN population as reported previously . PD-1 + cells in the DN population showed two peaks, PD-1 high and PD-1 low, which represented γ/δ T cells and α/β T cells, respectively . In the thymus of Vβ8 transgenic mice, there was a slight yet significant increase in the PD-1 + cells (1.2 versus 3.8%), which mostly reflected the increase in the PD-1 low cells in the DN population (40 versus 65%).
10704469:10	In both mice, the CD4 +CD8 + population totally lacked the expression of PD-1.
10704469:11	We then examined the mice transgenic for both TCR α and β chain genes.
10704469:12	In the thymus of H-Y mice, ∼20% of total thymocytes and nearly 90% of the DN population were found to express PD-1 with high intensities in both neutral (H-2 d) and positively selecting (H-2 b) backgrounds.
10704469:13	The thymus of 2C mice in the positively selecting background (H-2 b) exhibited as much as 63% PD-1 + cells, and again nearly 90% of the DN population strongly expressed PD-1.
10704469:14	Unlike normal and Vβ8 transgenic mice, significant proportions of DP thymocytes in H-Y and 2C mice also exhibited PD-1, ∼15 and 50%, respectively ( a).
10704469:15	However, the CD4/CD8 expression of thymocytes in the TCR-α/β transgenic mice was quite diffuse, particularly in 2C mice.
10704469:16	To have a better picture of the distribution of PD-1 + cells, the CD4/CD8 profiles of PD-1 + and PD-1 − populations were analyzed separately.
10704469:17	As shown in b, PD-1 + cells were present in the CD4 low and/or CD8 low in addition to DN populations in both H-Y (H-2 b) and 2C (H-2 b) mice.
10704469:18	The vast majority of CD4 highCD8 high DP cells as well as CD4 highCD8 − and CD4 −CD8 high SP populations lacked PD-1 expression.
10704469:19	In the female H-Y (H-2 b/d) transgenic as well as control mice, CD69 + thymocytes barely expressed PD-1 and vice versa ( c), implying that thymocytes during the positive selection process lacked PD-1 expression.
10704469:20	In 2C (H-2 b) mice, the majority of thymocytes expressed CD69 weakly, including both PD-1 + and PD-1 − cells ( c).
10704469:21	In the TCR transgenic mice, β selection largely proceeds based on the expression of transgenic TCR β chain, either as TCR-β homodimer in Vβ8 transgenic mice or as TCR-α/β complex in H-Y and 2C transgenic mice.
10704469:22	Although the studies on pTα −/− mice suggest that the three types of pre-TCR complex mentioned above achieve β selection in somewhat distinct fashions signaling downstream of the CD3 complex is expected to be similar . Our results here have reinforced that PD-1 expression is induced during the β selection process of DN thymocytes, which is variably enhanced in the TCR transgenic mice.
10704469:23	It remains to be further analyzed whether PD-1 is also expressed during the later selection processes such as positive and negative selection, particularly in 2C mice (see below).
10704469:24	To explore the functions of PD-1, we crossed Vβ8 and H-Y (H-2 d/d) transgenic mice with PD-1 −/− mice and analyzed their thymocytes.
10704469:25	As summarized in the total cell number of thymocytes in Vβ8 × PD-1 −/− transgenic mice was significantly increased compared with that in Vβ8 × PD-1 +/+ transgenic mice (1.49 ± 0.17 vs. 0.99 ± 0.3 × 10 −8, P < 0.005).
10704469:26	The increase was ascribed mostly to DP thymocytes (109.82 ± 12.65 vs. 73.51 ± 2.27 × 10 −6, P < 0.01), whereas the number of DN thymocytes remained unaffected.
10704469:27	Essentially similar results were obtained in the H-Y (H-2 d) mice, DP thymocytes being increased selectively in the absence of PD-1 (80.04 ± 30.83 vs. 125.11 ± 27.92 × 10 −6, P < 0.005).
10704469:28	The results strongly suggest that PD-1 negatively regulates the transition of DN thymocytes to the DP stage in the TCR transgenic mice.
10704469:29	The numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + SP thymocytes were increased proportionally to DP thymocytes in both Vβ8 × PD-1 −/− and H-Y (H-2 d/d) × PD-1 −/− mice, suggesting that the overall efficiency for the positive selection based on the TCRs of transgenic β chains and endogenous α chains was largely unaffected in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:30	Next, to define the effect of PD-1 deficiency on the positive selection for the transgenic TCR-α/β, we crossed PD-1 −/− mice with the female H-Y (H-2 b) and 2C (H-2 b) mice, in which the CD8 + cells expressing the transgenic TCR-α/β are positively selected.
10704469:31	The number of DP thymocytes in female H-Y (H-2 b) mice was significantly increased in the absence of PD-1, as before.
10704469:32	In the female H-Y (H-2 b) × PD-1 +/− mice, the number of CD8 + SP cells was also increased proportionally to both DP and CD4 + SP cells (∼1.5-fold; ).
10704469:33	In contrast, the number of CD8 + SP cells in the female H-Y (H-2 b) × PD-1 −/− mice remained the same as in the control female H-Y (H-2 b) mice (17.6 ± 7.63 vs. 16 ± 3.89 × 10 6) in spite of the fact that the numbers of DP and CD4 + SP cells were increased in parallel ∼1.5-fold.
10704469:34	FACS ® analysis indicated that the relative proportions of both T3.70 (transgenic TCR-α) high and CD24 −CD8 + cells were indeed decreased in the absence of PD-1 ( a), indicating that the efficiency of positive selection for the clonotypic T3.70 +CD8 + SP cells was significantly reduced.
10704469:35	On the other hand, the proportion of CD4 + SP thymocytes, which are positively selected on the basis of diversified TCRs of the transgenic TCR-β and endogenous TCR-α, was unaffected ( a).
10704469:36	In 2C (H-2 b) mice, the number of total as well as DP thymocytes was far less and the relative proportion of CD8 + SP thymocytes was much higher than in female H-Y (H-2 b) mice ( and ), probably reflecting higher affinity and/or avidity of 2C TCR-α/β for the selecting ligands . In the 2C (H-2 b) × PD-1 −/− mice, a significant reduction of CD8 + SP thymocytes was observed in terms of both absolute cell number and relative proportion, whereas the DP population was increased slightly compared with 2C (H-2 b) × PD-1 +/+ mice ( and b).
10704469:37	Furthermore, within the CD4 −CD8 + population, the percentages of those with the mature phenotypes (CD24 − and CD8β high) were significantly reduced in 2C (H-2 b) × PD-1 −/− (50%) than in 2C (H-2 b) × PD-1 +/+ mice (70%) ( b), suggesting that the reduction of positively selected CD8 + SP thymocytes in the former mice was apparently underestimated by the presence of transient CD4 low/−CD8 + cells.
10704469:38	Consistently, expression of CD69, a marker associated with positive selection, was also significantly reduced in both total and DP thymocytes in the absence of PD-1 ( b).
10704469:39	Although there was an apparent increase in the CD4 + SP thymocytes ( and b), the vast majority of CD4 + SP thymocytes in both groups highly expressed the clonotypic epitope (1B2) of transgenic TCR-α/β ( b).
10704469:40	Therefore, it probably reflects the increase in the transitional thymocytes rather than positively selected mature CD4 + SP cells, which is consistent with the accelerated β selection in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:41	These results have collectively suggested that the efficiency of positive selection for the cells expressing transgenic TCR-α/β is significantly reduced in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:42	We have reported previously that the injection of anti-CD3ε mAb into RAG-2 −/− mice induces significant expansion of DP cells expressing PD-1 .
10704469:43	Since the procedure is considered to mimic the β selection process we have generated RAG-2 −/− × PD-1 −/− mice and injected varying amounts of anti-CD3ε mAb.
10704469:44	50 μg of the anti-CD3ε mAb induced more expansion of the thymocytes in RAG-2 −/− × PD-1 −/− than in RAG-2 −/− × PD-1 +/+ mice (47.1 ± 21.8 vs. 27.3 ± 14.5 × 10 −6; n = 9, P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed any more by 100 μg or more (54.5 ± 26.1 vs. 53.1 ± 12.3 × 10 −6; n = 6, P > 0.05).
10704469:45	Our preliminary biochemical studies indicate that the cross-linking of PD-1 indeed inhibits the cell activation signals such as Ca 2+ influx mediated by B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking in a B cell line transfected with PD-1 cDNA (our unpublished data).
10704469:46	Therefore, it is suggested that PD-1 functions as a negatively regulating receptor for antigen stimulation.
10704469:47	These results have strongly suggested that PD-1 negatively regulates the β selection process probably by affecting the threshold of pre-TCR/CD3 complex–mediated signaling.
10704469:48	It has been further indicated that the efficiency of positive selection for SP thymocytes expressing transgenic TCR-α/β, but not for those expressing diversified endogenous TCR α chains, is significantly reduced in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:49	Two explanations may be considered for this phenomenon.
10704469:50	First, reduced efficiency of positive selection in the absence of PD-1 can be an indirect consequence of the accelerated β selection.
10704469:51	Since PD-1 deficiency is suggested to lower the threshold for pre–TCR-β/CD3 signaling, the DP thymocytes developed in the absence of PD-1 would include those that were selected by a weaker activation signal that otherwise could not allow them to expand.
10704469:52	Such DP cells that expanded by suboptimal β selection signaling may not be qualified for positive selection as long as the transgenic TCR-α/βs are fixed, resulting in the reduced efficiency of the subsequent positive selection.
10704469:53	However, these unqualified thymocytes may be rescued by the expression of endogenous TCR α chain to form new TCR-α/βs with compensatory higher avidity for the selecting ligands, which may explain the unchanged efficiency of positive selection for such thymocytes in the absence of PD-1.
10704469:54	Alternatively, PD-1 might directly affect the positive selection process, independently of the effect on the β selection.
10704469:55	Unlike in normal and Vβ8 transgenic mice, the H-Y and 2C mice expressed PD-1 in a portion of DP thymocytes, the CD4 lowCD8 low population, which may undergo positive selection .
10704469:56	It may then be possible that the deficiency of PD-1 causes the hyperactivation of this population upon interaction with selecting ligands for TCR, resulting in negative rather than positive selection.
10704469:57	We consider the latter less likely because the efficiency of the positive selection for CD4 + SP thymocytes was unaffected in H-Y × PD-1 −/− mice in both neutral and positive selecting backgrounds.
10704469:58	If PD-1 directly regulates the positive selection process, the PD-1 deficiency should affect both CD4 + SP and CD8 + SP thymocytes similarly.
10704469:59	In addition, at least in the H-Y model, PD-1 is not significantly expressed in the CD69 + population ( c).
10704469:60	Whichever is the case, PD-1 deficiency is strongly suggested to result in the significant alteration of the final T cell repertoire either directly or indirectly.
10704469:61	We have reported that B6 mice deficient for PD-1 develop autoimmune diseases, including lupus-like glomerulonephritis and destructive arthritis, as they age, which are greatly accelerated by the additional lpr/lpr mutation . In addition to the dysregulation of peripheral tolerance it is tempting to speculate that the altered T cell repertoire formation in the absence of PD-1 may also increase the likelihood of the emergence of mature autoreactive T cells and thereby predispose the mice to the systemic autoimmune diseases.

19190745:0	Introduction 
Human lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by the filarial parasites Brugia malayi Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti infects 120 million people worldwide, of which 40 million people show chronic disease symptoms . The disease is estimated to be responsible for 5.5 million DALYs, and is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide . A further one billion people (18% of the world's population) are at risk of infection.
19190745:1	The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) aims to use mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission and to reduce morbidity, with annual doses of a multi-drug regimen for at least five years .
19190745:2	The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control aims to establish by 2010 community-based sustainable ivermectin treatments of 50 million people in 19 African countries having meso- and hyper-endemicity.
19190745:3	However, it appears unlikely that any of these MDA regimens will be sufficient to eliminate LF or onchocerciasis in all endemic areas . Numerous technical challenges threaten the success of these eradication programs , including incomplete efficacy of available drugs against adult filarial worms , severe drug toxicity in people with heavy loiasis infections and the risk that filarial worms will develop resistance to the drugs available for MDA . Ivermectin (IVM) resistance has been reported worldwide in several other parasitic nematodes . 
The emergence of drug resistant strains of the O. volvulus parasite was initially suggested by reports of patients with onchocerciasis who failed to respond to IVM treatment and a recent report from Ghana has provided the first direct proof of IVM resistance in O.
19190745:4	volvulus populations . A number of studies have associated IVM resistance with genetic markers (reviewed in ), while a recent, more extensive study using worms taken from individuals before and after repeated IVM treatments, has demonstrated that IVM causes genetic selection on O. volvulus .
19190745:5	At present there are no alternative drugs for IVM for use in the onchocerciasis MDA programs that can reduce Mf or kill adult worms and no vaccines are available . Vaccines that decrease transmission would complement MDA programs and may be necessary for complete elimination . Notably, antibiotic treatment targeting Wolbachia endosymbionts of filarial nematodes is emerging as an alternative drug treatment for filariasis.
19190745:6	Doxycycline treatment has been shown to result in an almost complete loss of Mf and macrofilaricidal effects in LF and in sterilization of adult worms and macrofilaricidal effects in O.
19190745:7	volvulus (reviewed in ).
19190745:8	However, the period of treatment with doxycycline at present (between 4–8 weeks) is not applicable to mass treatment strategies, due to both the logistical difficulties and contra-indication in children under eight and pregnant women , as a result antibiotic treatment regimens require further refinement.
19190745:9	Therefore, a major priority has to be the identification of new drugs with strong activity against adult filarial worms (macrofilaricidal) which have new classes of chemistry, new molecular targets, and novel modes of action.
19190745:10	Recent breakthroughs in genomics and chemistry make macrofilaricidal drug development more feasible, and accordingly a high priority goal with the WHO/TDR and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , , . 
RNA interference (RNAi) was first described in Caenorhabditis elegans where it was shown to spread systemically throughout the whole organism and is widely used to identify gene function and has been developed for high-throughput genomics , .
19190745:11	This powerful reverse genetics mechanism thus provides an invaluable tool which could be transferred to gene function studies and novel drug discovery in filarial nematodes.
19190745:12	Moreover, it potentially provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify pre-validated drug targets after efficient mining of nematode genomic databases and RNAi genome wide C. elegans databases.
19190745:13	. RNAi has been successfully demonstrated in a number of parasitic nematodes (reviewed in ), including filarial nematodes , , .
19190745:14	However, although RNAi has been demonstrated in parasitic nematodes, its application as a tool for high-throughput functional genomic screening for identification of essential parasite genes has not yet been achieved due to variable success in transferring the technology from C. elegans to parasitic nematodes and problems with inconsistent results and poor reproducibility . 
While a wide range of target genes have been screened using RNAi in parasitic nematodes, only a small number of these genes have been selected due to their potential as drug targets . Filarial proteases have been recognized as potential drug targets . RNAi targeting the cathepsin L- and Z-like cysteine proteases (CPL & CPZ respectively) has clearly validated their essential role during O.
19190745:15	volvulus L3 molting . The function(s) of CPLs in filarial nematodes during embryogenesis, however, was only predicted indirectly by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) , while detailed studies of the CPLs in C. elegans have provided more direct proof of their function in the free living nematodes.
19190745:16	However, their predicted essential function during development may not always be conserved in both filarial nematodes and C. elegans as has been shown for the roles of CPL and CPZ in the molting of O. volvulus and C. elegans . Therefore it would be beneficial to be able to directly and reliably assess their essential function(s) using RNAi technology in filarial adult worms, in particular during embryogenesis.
19190745:17	Here we demonstrate the use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated silencing to study the possible function of several of the cathepsin-like enzymes in B.

Discussion 
Cysteine proteases play important roles in both intracellular and extracellular processes which are important in both development and survival.
19190745:19	Cathepsin-like enzymes have been identified as potential targets for drug or vaccine development in many parasites, including filarial nematodes , due to as their potential essential roles in feeding , molting , embryogenesis and immune functions (reviewed in ).
19190745:20	Here we describe the use of RNAi techniques in B.
19190745:21	malayi adult females to directly assess the function(s) of the cysteine protease (CP) genes that belong to the CPZ and the group Ia of Bm -CPL protein families.
19190745:22	In filarial nematodes the gene family of group Ia cathepsin L-like protease enzymes ( Bm-cpl : Bm-cpl-1 Bm-cpl-4 and Bm-cpl-5 ) has been shown to be associated with larval molting and remodeling of the cuticle and eggshell . Antibodies raised to Ov -CPL-1 (64–65% identity with Bm -CPL-1, -4 and -5) and Bp -CPL-4 (77, 91 and 94% identity with Bm -CPL-1, -5 and -4, respectively) recognized the reproductive system in B.
19190745:23	malayi similarly (S.
19190745:24	Lustigman, unpublished data), and this localization was similar to that of Ce -CPL-1 . The putative functions of the group Ic cathepsin L-like protease enzymes ( Bm-cpl-2 Bm-cpl-3 Bm-cpl-6 Bm-cpl-7 and Bm-cpl-8 ) are still unknown.
19190745:25	In C. elegans Ce-cpl-1 was shown to be essential for embryogenesis while Ce-cpz-1 has a function during embryogenesis but is not essential and also has an important role during molting . The C. elegans Ce-cpl-1 knock-out mutant has an embryonic lethal phenotype . RNAi targeting of Ce-cpl-1 produced an early embryonic lethal phenotype with 95–100% of F 1 embryos arresting with only 100–200 cells following dsRNA injection and ∼92% of F 1 embryos arresting after soaking of L4 in dsRNA . Interestingly, the H. contortus cpl-1 gene can rescue the C. elegans cpl-1 RNAi effect, suggesting that the parasite CPL is an orthologue of C. elegans CPL-1 and that CPL-1 is functionally conserved in parasitic nematode species .
19190745:26	This is further demonstrated in O.
19190745:27	volvulus where Ov-cpl-1 can rescue the C. elegans Ce-cpl-1 mutant, using a rescue construct containing the Ce-cpl-1 promoter, the full length Ov-cpl-1 cDNA from the first ATG to the stop codon and the Ce-cpl-1 3′UTR (S.
19190745:28	Hashmi, unpublished data).
19190745:29	However, despite high sequence similarity the predicted essential function of a gene is not always essentially conserved in both filarial nematodes and C. elegans as has been shown for the different roles of CPL and CPZ in the molting of O. volvulus and C. elegans . dsRNA-mediated silencing of the Bm-cpl group Ia genes in B.
19190745:30	malayi adult females leads to phenotypic changes in embryos, where embryos from Bm-cpl treated worms were not fully developed within the eggshell, leading to space between the embryo and eggshell.
19190745:31	Embryonic viability following RNAi treatment with Bm-cpl was also affected.
19190745:32	The role(s) of cysteine proteases during embryo development have been shown to include an essential role in yolk processing.
19190745:33	Cysteine proteases are known to be involved in yolk degradation during invertebrate embryonic development , and Ce -CPL-1 has been shown to play an essential role in yolk protein processing during embryonic development, where a loss of CPL-1 activity in the Ce-cpl-1 mutant leads to formation of enlarged cytoplasmic yolk vesicles and embryonic lethality . Whether the Bm-cpl cysteine proteases are also involved with yolk protein processing would be interesting to investigate.
19190745:34	Immunolocalization of the native Bm -CPLs indirectly suggests that they do localize to yolk vesicles within the developing embryonic stages but further co-localization studies are required to confirm these observations.
19190745:35	Also of relevance would be to investigate the co-localization of the native Bm -CPLs with their endogenous cysteine protease inhibitors, such as the cystatins . The activities of cathepsin-like cysteine proteases are controlled by their specific endogenous protein inhibitors . In C. elegans co-localization of CPL-1 and CPZ-1 enzymes with both endogenous CP inhibitors and yolk proteins has been clearly demonstrated and data indicates that CPL-1 and CPZ-1 and their putative inhibitor, Ce -CPI-2a, play a role during oogenesis and fertilization in C. elegans . The O. volvulus CPL-1 and CPZ are also localized in the same regions as the endogenous inhibitor, Ov -CPI-2 , implying that Ov -CPI-2 may regulate both enzymes during O.
19190745:36	volvulus development.
19190745:37	In addition, both enzymes are essential for third to fourth stage larva molting as demonstrated by RNAi . 
dsRNA-mediated silencing of the Bm-cpl genes suggests that some of the B. malayi CPs such as the Bm -CPL group Ia enzymes may function during embryonic development and show similar function(s) to C. elegans CPL-1, their most phylogenetically related CP, therefore suggesting conserved essential function(s) between these filarial nematode and C. elegans CPs.
19190745:38	As CP inhibitors targeting parasite CPs have been proposed as therapeutics in both protozoan , and metazoan parasites, CPs involved in embryogenesis clearly provide a valuable putative target if it results in a block in embryogenesis which, in filarial nematodes, would, in essence, lead to sterility of the adult worm.
19190745:39	Therefore, it would be invaluable to determine specific cysteine protease inhibitors which would target the endogenous Bm -CPL group Ia enzymes and moreover, could be used as therapeutic agents against the parasite.
19190745:40	Methodologies, such as synthetic combinatorial library analysis specific chemical library screening and small molecule affinity fingerprinting are available to identify such specific inhibitors.
19190745:41	In order to elucidate the function(s) of the cysteine proteases of B. malayi we have developed and improved the reverse genetics RNAi techniques which have been used previously in filarial nematodes.
19190745:42	RNAi has been demonstrated successfully in parasitic helminths and could provide an invaluable tool in determining gene function and identification of drug and vaccine targets.
19190745:43	Using RNAi to selectively target the potential drug targets; the cathepsin-like cysteine protease genes, in adult female B.
19190745:44	malayi we have demonstrated that these genes can be affected; dsRNA-mediated silencing of the Bm-cpl genes led to significant reductions in the number of Mf released by adult female nematodes.
19190745:45	While Bm-cpl-1 Bm-cpl-5 and Bm-cpz all showed this persistent phenotype following dsRNA-mediated silencing the most significant reductions in the release of Mf were observed with dsRNA corresponding to Bm-cpl-5 therefore we focused on optimization of the RNAi technique using fragments corresponding to Bm-cpl-5 and the 100% conserved pro-region of Bm-cpl-1 Bm-cpl-4 and Bm-cpl-5 designed to target all three of the B. malayi filarial group Ia cathepsin L-like cysteine protease transcripts which we named Bm-cpl . Treatment of adult worms with dsRNA or siRNA corresponding to the Bm-cpl genes resulted in a persistent and significant reduction in the release of Mf, the majority of which were dead, and changes in intrauterine progeny.
19190745:46	At the same time, these treatments also resulted in a specific reduction in the Bm-cpl transcript levels.
19190745:47	While we can not directly correlate the observed phenotypic effects with the specific reduction in Bm-cpl transcript levels it is tempting to speculate that the effects on embryonic development and Mf production are due to the specific knock-down of the Bm-cpl genes using the dsRNA-silencing pathway.
19190745:48	Interestingly, while RNAi treatment using both dsRNA and siRNA were effective in specific gene silencing, the uptake studies have suggested that smaller fragments of dsRNA and siRNAs are able to penetrate adult female B.
19190745:49	malayi worms more efficiently than longer dsRNAs, pointing to the possibility that the cuticle barrier in the female worm is more yielding to the penetration of smaller fragments of dsRNA and siRNA.
19190745:50	Therefore, the efficiency of RNAi may be dependent on the dsRNA fragment size.
19190745:51	It is also important to note that due to RNA fragment size differences the molarity of each dsRNA tested was different (dsRNA range; 400–800 bp, siRNA; ∼13.5 bp, at 1.5 mg/ml; dsRNA range; 2.82–5.63 µM, siRNA; 166.83 µM, at 2.0 mg/ml; dsRNA range; 3.75–7.51
19190745:52	µM, siRNA; 222.44 µM).
19190745:53	However, despite these molar differences, RNAi using longer dsRNA was still effective in this in vitro screening system.
19190745:54	dsRNA molarity has been shown to affect the efficiency of RNAi targeting of actin in L. sigmodontis ( Ls-act ) with 3.5 µM giving the most consistent reductions in transcript, while higher molar concentrations of dsRNA (17.5 and 35 µM) resulted in increased levels of heat shock protein 60 ( Ls-hsp60 ) suggesting the worms were stressed . Therefore dsRNA molarity might still be an important consideration to keep in mind when optimizing RNAi techniques.
19190745:55	While successful siRNA application has been reported in T. colubriformis and S. mansoni it has not previously been documented for filarial nematodes.
19190745:56	We have shown for the first time that RNAi treatment using siRNA can also be effective in filarial nematodes and show the same phenotypic changes and reduction in transcript levels as RNAi treatment with fragments corresponding to the same region of dsRNA.
19190745:57	This provides an additional RNAi strategy for future projects aimed at assessing the function(s) of genes in filarial worms and the discovery of novel drug targets.
19190745:58	This is important as many of the inconsistencies with RNAi in parasitic helminths could be due to differences in the RNAi pathways between these helminths and free-living C. elegans . Analyses of genome databases, including H. contortus and B. malayi have shown that while putative orthologues of many genes required for RNAi are present, other genes which are essential for the recognition and systemic spread of dsRNA in C. elegans such as rde-4 sid and rsd genes, appear to be absent.
19190745:59	The absence of these genes could explain the problems associated with RNAi in parasitic helminths, although it could be that these genes are not required or alternative pathways exist.
19190745:60	However, although the genes for dsRNA processing appear to be missing, the machinery for processing siRNA appears to be present.
19190745:61	Therefore, the use of siRNA vs. dsRNA may provide a more robust RNAi assay for some of the target transcripts.
19190745:62	We have also tested an alternative method for delivering the dsRNA molecules to adult B.

19190745:64	This technique provides a way of minimizing the handling of nematodes and has the potential to facilitate higher-throughput RNAi screens.
19190745:65	Dialysis of the dsRNA prior to RNAi treatment was also important in reducing the non-specific off-target effects which can occur following RNAi . In filarial parasites treatment with control dsRNA, resulted in a 24.7–49.8%
19190745:66	reduction in molting of O. volvulus L3 larvae , and resulted in reduced motility in B.
19190745:67	malayi adult worms . Off-target effects following RNAi treatment have also been demonstrated in S. mansoni these including non-specific changes in mRNA levels, changes in cercariae distribution and reduction in sporocyst length following treatment with control dsRNA . We noted some non-specific toxic effects of unrelated dsRNA; for example the RNAi with the negative control dsRNA we selected to use, Ov-cpz-int2 resulted in 14.9% reduction in the release of Mf 48 h after RNAi.
19190745:68	However, this was not accompanied by any indirect knock-down in target gene transcription.
19190745:69	E. coli β-lactamase ( Ec-bla ) dsRNA (GenBank accession no.
19190745:70	NC_010862, position 24517-24770) was also used as a negative control and also showed some off target effects (1.8%, 10.5% and 26.0% reduction in Mf release on day 1, 3 and 5).
19190745:71	Regardless, the effect with the gene specific RNAi was significant.
19190745:72	These off-target effects could, in part, be due to an innate immune response mounted in the nematode in response to foreign RNA.
19190745:73	Viral RNAs are recognized by the innate immune response through toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 for dsRNA and TLR7 or TLR8 for ssRNA . In addition, RNA silencing serves as an innate anti-viral mechanism in plants, fungi and animals , and has been shown to be involved in C. elegans . RNAi silencing in nematodes may have evolved to protect them against viruses and it could be speculated as a reason to why nematodes appear to be free from viruses.
19190745:74	Another possibility is that the off-target effects could be due to the generation of microRNAs (miRNAs) from the dsRNA control sequence used.
19190745:75	Intronic sequences have been shown to potentially also contain functional miRNAs .
19190745:76	However, searching the intron sequence used in this study ( Ov-cpz-int2 ) shows that it contains no miRNA regions so this appears unlikely.
19190745:77	In order to effectively assess the essential function(s) of filarial genes using RNAi it is important to keep in mind the unpredictability associated with RNAi and to take care to optimize the conditions according to the target gene of interest.
19190745:78	Suppression of gene expression following RNAi treatment, using current methodologies, appears to be more effective for some genes rather than others .
19190745:79	This could be due to experimental parameters such as dsRNA preparations, length of dsRNA, and regions of dsRNA amplified, or parasite factors including abundance and location of the target gene transcript.
19190745:80	As seen in C. elegans the life-cycle stage may also be important; RNAi is often not efficient in the treated worms (P 0), and the phenotypic effects are only obvious in the progeny (F 1), after the target mRNA that is produced in the F 1 generation is also degraded . Our studies, unfortunately, can only measure the phenotypic and genotypic outcomes in treated (P 0) adult female worms.
19190745:81	When the steady-state transcript levels in the adult worms are high it can be difficult to observe significant reduction even though the phenotypic release of F 1 progeny is affected.
19190745:82	One potential solution will be, in the future, to also measure the transcript levels of the targeted mRNA in the F 1 progeny within the uterus or secreted into culture.
19190745:83	In order to be able to obtain information as similar as possible to C. elegans the culture conditions in parasitic nematodes need to be optimized in order to maintain parasites for longer periods of time and, ideally, to allow for their subsequent development into the next life-cycle stages.
19190745:84	The effects of RNAi treatment may also need to be studied directly in vivo or after monitoring the development of the F 1 following treatment of adult worms in vitro then passing the secreted Mf through the full life-cycle in vivo .
19190745:85	It may also be possible to perform RNAi directly on early developmental stages such as eggs and embryos.
19190745:86	Using uptake studies we can demonstrate that dsRNA is taken up into eggs and embryos isolated from the uterine contents of adult female B.

20175904:0	Introduction 
Suicide is a known worldwide leading cause of death with psychiatric illnesses listed among the strongest predictors .
20175904:1	Other predictors listed are familial troubles and poverty . 
There is a dearth of literature on the subject of suicidal cut throat injuries in Nigeria.
20175904:2	It is either the cases are unreported or that they are fortunately very rare.
20175904:3	However, literatures from other parts of the world on the prevalence of these injuries are available . 
These self-inflicted injuries are obvious with transection of the hypopharynx, larynx or trachea and involvement of other parts of the body in some occasions . Their initial management is straightforward and involves establishing an airway either via endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and then surgical repair of the transected tissues , this may follow wound debridement if the wound is infected.
20175904:4	Surgical repair is fraught with laryngo-tracheal stenosis which can be a long term morbidity suffered by patients . 
Cut throat injuries with suicide as the motivating factor usually require rapid and interdisciplinary treatment . The anesthetist and psychiatrists working in conjunction with the Otolaryngologist should manage these patients.
20175904:5	This paper reviews the management of three men with suicidal intent who presented to our hospital at different times within a period of 14 months with cut throat injuries.
20175904:6	Case presentations 
Discussion 
The incidence of suicidal cut throat injuries in our country may be fortunately rare or the cases are unreported in literature.
20175904:7	When they occur, a multi disciplinary approach is required in the effective management of affected patients . This requires the close collaboration of the Otolaryngologist, the anesthetist and the psychiatrist.
20175904:8	The anesthetist secures an uncompromised airway and makes sure the patient is breathing, the otolaryngologist assesses the injury and repairs the severed tissues with the aim of restoration of swallowing, phonation and breathing.
20175904:9	The psychiatrist provides adequate care and supervision during and after surgical treatment.
20175904:10	Our patients presented without respiratory distress and the management of their airway was by executing a tracheostomy to secure a reliable airway and through which anesthetic gases were administered to effect proper surgical repair of the severed anterior neck structures under general anesthesia.
20175904:11	However, in severe airway compromise, the airway can be maintained via endotracheal intubation . 
Surgical repair of the severed tissues is the treatment option .
20175904:12	One patient had wound debridement with secondary suturing as a result of wound infection from late presentation, a common feature in our environment.
20175904:13	All our patients had injuries exposing their hypopharynx and larynx.
20175904:14	Suturing was achieved in all of them with complete restoration of swallowing, phonation and breathing.
20175904:15	Suicide is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the world with more than a million deaths occurring annually .
20175904:16	It occurs 20.4 times more frequently in individuals with major depression than the general population and therefore these patients will require psychiatric intervention . In a 5 year study in New Zealand of 302 individuals making medically serious suicide attempts, it was found that 6.7% died by suicide and 37% made at least one fatal suicide attempt within a 5 year period.
20175904:17	Hence, the need for enhanced follow-up, treatment and surveillance of any individual making serious suicide attempts . 
All our patients were considered suicidal, therefore had close psychiatric care and supervision in the immediate post-operative period and after discharge from otolaryngologic care.
20175904:18	Unemployment can act as a stressful life event leading to suicide  with studies suggesting an increase in the parasuicide and suicide rates among unemployed individuals than in the general population . It is a known fact that the suicide rate among non-waged workers is significantly higher than that of waged workers . The link between unemployment and mental illness is however bidirectional as individuals with mental illness are less likely to be employed than those without mental illness.
20175904:19	All our patients were unemployed and gave that as the motivating factor for their injuries.
20175904:20	In our society like many others, the male is the bread winner of the family, providing for not only his immediate family but members of an extended family.
20175904:21	The male as the breadwinner of a family when unemployed, can be frustrated and may want to take his own life.
20175904:22	Socioeconomic improvement of otherwise normal individuals and early detection and treatment of depression in the community is important in order to prevent serious suicide attempts.
20175904:23	Although suicide prevention efforts should include a focus on screening and treating mental disorders, ways must also be found to identify the many people without mental disorders who are at risk of suicidal behaviors.
20175904:24	Conclusion 
Suicidal cut throat injuries are fortunately rare in our environment but they do occur.
20175904:25	A close collaboration of the Otolaryngologist, Anesthetist and Psychiatrist is required in the effective management of patients with good outcome.
20175904:26	Providing jobs for individuals in our country may act as confounding factors in the reduction of the prevalence of cut throat injuries of suicidal origin.
20175904:27	Apart from focusing on screening and the treatment of mental disorders, ways must also be found to identify the many people without mental disorders who are at risk of suicidal behaviors.

20565809:0	Background 
TTF-1 is a tissue-specific transcription factor expressed in epithelial cells of the lung and the thyroid, including C-cells as well as certain areas of the brain.
20565809:1	TTF-1 is expressed in approximately 72% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas, and may be a valuable marker for identifying the lung as the site of origin of a metastatic adenocarcinoma.
20565809:2	Case Presentation 
A 72-year-old gravida 1/para 1 woman presented with a palpable mass in the left breast.
20565809:3	Her sister died of breast cancer some years earlier.
20565809:4	There was a past history of operated parathyroid adenoma some years ago but no previous history of any malignancy.
20565809:5	The patient was a non- smoker and had never used hormonal drugs.
20565809:6	Clinical examination demonstrated a palpable tumour in her left breast in the upper inner quadrant, no fixation to skin or underlying fascia.
20565809:7	Mammography from upper inner quadrant of the left breast showed a dense, relatively well defined, oval shaped mass lesion with a microlobulated margin measuring 51 × 33 × 35 mm with coarse calcifications centrally in the mass and in addition finer micro calcifications antero lateral to the main tumour, malignant in appearance.
20565809:8	The total maximal diameter including the calcifications was approximately 6 cm.
20565809:9	Ultrasound left breast showed an irregular solid malignant appearing tumour, corresponding to the mammographic lesion, measuring approximately 38 mm maximal diameter.
20565809:10	No enlarged lymph nodes in the left axillae.
20565809:11	PET scan and CT scan showed no other malignancy other than known breast tumour.
20565809:12	As no other origin for the tumour was found, the patient was treated with left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping.
20565809:13	The sentinel node was normal.
20565809:14	The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged the next day following the operation.
20565809:15	Materials and methods 
We performed immunohistochemical investigation using the indirect streptavidin-biotin method on 3-5 μm slices.
20565809:16	Regarding TTF-1 staining we used same methods at two different laboratories for verification of the findings.
20565809:17	Further staining for CK5/6, CK 7, CK20, CK 18, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, ER, PGR, chromgranin, synaptophysin, CD 56, HER 2/neu, Ki67, p 63 and MA was performed (table ).
20565809:18	Results 
Macroscopic investigation showed a mastectomy specimen measuring 21 × 18 × 3 cm, weighing 1042 gram.
20565809:19	In the upper inner quadrant there was a round, well-circumscribed tumour with largest diameter 3,8 cm laying 0,6 cm from the chest wall.
20565809:20	The tumour was white with pale yellow necrotic areas (Figure ).
20565809:21	Microscopic investigation showed a sharp demarcation of the tumour to the surrounding breast tissue.
20565809:22	There was some necrosis centrally, with more preserved structure peripherally in the tumour.
20565809:23	The tumour tissue grew as trabeculae and confluent nests with scanty glandular tissue.
20565809:24	The tumour cells were large with moderate amount of cytoplasm.
20565809:25	The nuclei were variable in appearance being round, oval or spindle shaped.
20565809:26	The chromatin was coarsely granulated and vesicular.
20565809:27	There were numerous mitoses and apoptotic bodies (Figure ).
20565809:28	The nuclei in the invasive tumour cells showed diffuse and strong positive immunoreactivity to TTF-1 marker (Figure ).
20565809:29	The neuroendocrine marker CD56 was slightly positive (Figure ), whilst chromogranin and synaptophysin were negative.
20565809:30	CK 5/6 was demonstrated in isolated cells within the tumour (Figure ).
20565809:31	Ki67 was positive in over 50% of the tumour cells.
20565809:32	The tumour was positive for CK7 and CK18 but negative for ER, mammaglobin, GCDPF-15 and CK20.
20565809:33	HER2/neu showed heterogeneous C-erb-2 protein score 2+/3+, but silver in situ hybridization (SISH) without gene amplification.
20565809:34	There was a weak positive reaction to PGR in the biopsy material, but not in the mastectomy tissue.
20565809:35	An in situ component was seen in the vicinity of the tumour.
20565809:36	The myoepithelial layer of the carcinoma in situ was verified immunohistochemically with p63 and MA.
20565809:37	The in situ tumour cells had the same morphological appearance as in the invasive tumour (Figure ).
20565809:38	The in situ component showed a positive reaction to TTF-1(Figure ) and CK5/6 (Figure ).
20565809:39	Discussion 
We believe this case represents TTF-1 positive infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, histological grade 3.
20565809:40	The tumour was heterogeneous with small areas of basal-like and neuroendocrine differentiation.
20565809:41	In three large studies of primary breast carcinomas [ - ] there were 96, 51 and 35 (total 182) carcinoma cases, respectively, that were all TTF-1 negative.
20565809:42	Only a few cases of TTF-1 primary small-cell carcinoma in breast have been reported . Yamamoto described two small-cell breast carcinomas with positive TTF-1 whilst Ersahin reported one case of small-cell breast carcinoma which was positive for TTF-1 and basal-like markers.
20565809:43	In the case we report, we found no areas typical for small cell carcinoma growth, although some areas with trabecular growth gave a partial neuroendocrine impression.
20565809:44	Because of heterogeneous growth with focally oval and spindled shaped nuclei, a metaplastic carcinoma was considered.
20565809:45	It is difficult to rule out this alternative, but a lack of squamous or heterologous metaplasia makes this less possible.
20565809:46	The initial investigations of the biopsy gave suspicion of metastasis from lung cancer because of the positive TTF-1 reaction.
20565809:47	Previous studies have shown that lung cancer, malignant melanoma and lymphoma are the three most common candidates for secondary breast tumours [ - ].
20565809:48	An almost round tumour could resemble a metastasis, but some high grade primary tumours can also have this shape.
20565809:49	In our case the tumour was deep seated in the breast (6 mm from the chest wall).
20565809:50	This correlates poorly with secondary breast tumours which are often found near to the skin . 
The presence of a positive TTF-1 reaction in the in situ component as well as in the invasive component in this case gives strong support for primary breast carcinoma.
20565809:51	We are not aware of any previously reported TTF-1 positive ductal carcinoma in situ of non small-cell type.
20565809:52	In order to be quite sure that this represented breast ducts and not vessels with tumour tissue or peritumoral retraction artefacts, we also investigated these areas with MA and p63.
20565809:53	Both markers were positive for myoepithelial cells.
20565809:54	Mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 were negative in the tumour, but this does not exclude primary breast carcinoma as these markers have a varied sensitivity of 60-75% in primary breast carcinomas . 
HER2/neu expression can be seen in both carcinomas of breast and lung . Our findings with C-erb-2 protein score 2+/3+ and SISH without gene amplification have no differential value in this case.
20565809:55	We found weak postive reaction for PGR in the core biopsies.
20565809:56	Positive reactions for both ER and PGR have been reported for lung cancer  and give therefore no support to either breast cancer or metastasis diagnosis.
20565809:57	In agreement with Ersahin et al we found a positive expression of the basal-like marker CK5/6.
20565809:58	This was especially noticeable in the in situ component, but only scattered positive cells in the invasive component.
20565809:59	This can possibly represent a dedifferentiation in the tumour tissue.
20565809:60	Previous studies have considered ductal carcinoma in situ with basal- like phenotype as a possible precursor to invasive basal-like cancer . 
Our case showed high grade ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive tumour, and such tumours are more commonly basal like than low to intermediate grade lesions . 
Conclusion 
We have presented an unusual case of TTF-1 positive primary infiltrating ductal carcinoma with focal basal-like and neuroendocrine differentiation.
20565809:61	The in situ component with positive TTF-1 is the most important indication that this represents a primary tumour.
20565809:62	Despite the fact that TTF-1 is known as a specific marker for lung and thyroid tumours, this case shows that primary non small-cell breast carcinomas can also be positive.

21373272:0	Introduction 
The signaling of ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) is a major contributing condition leading to gastric mucosal injury induced by stress, (,) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), () and Helicobacter pylori infection.
21373272:1	() Gastric I-R causes mucosal ulcerative lesions as well as acute inflammation associated with neutrophil accumulation.
21373272:2	(–) Previous studies have demonstrated that the infiltration of neutrophils into gastric tissue via neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of I-R-induced gastric injury, because neutrophils generate tissue damage factors such as reactive oxygen species and proteases.
21373272:3	(,) Neutrophil accumulation is a complex phenomenon that also involves various adhesion molecules and inflammatory mediators.
21373272:4	Using a rat model of gastric I-R, we have revealed that reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion-induced mucosal injury.
21373272:5	(,) In addition to reactive oxygen species, a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β, are released from post-ischemic gastric tissue to modulate tissue repair and adaptation.
21373272:6	These cytokines are elaborated soon after gastric ischemic injury and can acutely regulate gastric mucosal survival or apoptosis and trigger additional cellular inflammatory response.
21373272:7	The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor supergene family that function in ligand-activated transcription.
21373272:8	(,) PPARs consist of at least three isoforms, α, β, and γ, encoded by unique genes.
21373272:9	Among them, PPAR-γ is highly expressed in adipose tissue, colon, spleen, adrenal gland, and macrophages.
21373272:10	Previous studies have demonstrated that the naturally occurring arachidonic acid metabolite, 15-deoxy-Δ 12,14-prostaglandin J 2 (15d-PGJ 2), as well as thiazolidinedione (TZD) and certain novel non-TZD insulin-sensitizing agents, are ligands and agonist of this receptor.
21373272:11	Although PPAR-γ play a key role in adipose differentiation, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis, recent studies suggest that they might be involved in the control of inflammation and especially in the modulation of the expression of various cytokines in monocytes and macrophages.
21373272:12	(–)
Recently, our group and others reported that PPAR-γ plays an anti-inflammatory role in gastric inflammation induced by I-R, (–) aspirin, () and Helicobacter pylori infection () in rats.
21373272:13	In 2001, we firstly demonstrated that pioglitazone, a synthetic TZD, markedly reduced gastric erosions induced by aspirin as well as inhibited the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α.
21373272:14	() In addition, we have reported the gastric cytoprotection by pioglitazone and 15d-PGJ 2 against I-R injury, associated with anti-inflammatory actions of these ligands.
21373272:15	(,) This beneficial effects by PPAR-γ ligands on I-R-induced gastric injury have been also confirmed by several investigators, however, the precise mechanism of the cytoprotection in vivo is not elucidated thoroughly.
21373272:16	In addition, Nakajima et al. () showed that no expression of PPAR-γ could be detected by Western blot analysis in the rat stomach.
21373272:17	On the basis of these observations, we determined the gastric localization of PPAR-γ expression in the rat gastric mucosa, and examined whether GW9662, an antagonist of PPAR-γ, can attenuate the protective effects of pioglitazone and 15d-PGJ 2 in order to elucidate whether the protective effects of these ligands are related to the activation of the PPAR-γ receptor.
21373272:18	Finally, to clarify the mechanism of cytoprotective properties of pioglitazone, we performed a global analysis of gene expression in the gastric mucosal cells of rats treated with pioglitazone.
21373272:19	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In the present, we demonstrated the gastric expression of PPAR-γ in rats by the immunohistochemistry and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody for PPAR-γ, and by mRNA expression for PPAR-γ, and showed that GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist, reversed the gastro-protective effects of pioglitazone and 15d-PGJ 2 against I-R injury.
21373272:20	In addition, enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the stomach after I-R was markedly inhibited by pioglitazone.
21373272:21	Finally, the global analysis of mRNA expression of gastric mucosal cells obtained by the microdissection showed that up- and down-regulated genes after the pioglitazone treatment, and that anti-inflammatory effects of pioglitazone may be associated with the up-regulation of HSPs and endoplasmic reticulum-related proteins.
21373272:22	The most striking findings of the present study are that expression of PPAR-γ is observed in mainly gastric epithelial cells in vivo and in cultured normal gastric epithelial cell line, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-PCR.
21373272:23	This is the first report in which the gastric PPAR-γ expression in rats is confirmed.
21373272:24	More interestingly, the expression of PPAR-γ protein in the stomach was enhanced after the treatment of pioglitazone without increased mRNA transcription, indicating that pioglitazone may stabilize the protein of PPAR-γ.
21373272:25	In contrast to a previous report uisng renal cells by Matsuyama et al. () PPAR-γ expression was not enhanced after ischemia-reperfusion in rats.
21373272:26	Although the mechanism in regulating gastric mucosal PPAR-γ expression is still unknown, the present data using DNA microarray may give possible information about it.
21373272:27	In order to confirm whether the protective effect of PPAR-γ ligands is due to activation of PPAR-γ, we have investigated whether the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662 attenuates the observed protective effects of these ligands.
21373272:28	We demonstrate here that GW966 completely reversed the gastro-protective effects of pioglitazone and 15d-PGJ 2 against I-R injury.
21373272:29	Recently, Wada et al. () further defined the protective effects of endogenous PPAR-γ activity in gastric injury induced by I-R through an examination of PPAR-γ-deficient mice.
21373272:30	They provided strong evidence in support of an important role for endogenous PPAR-γ activity in protecting from I-R injury in the stomach.
21373272:31	Taken together, these findings support the view that the activation of PPAR-γ contributes to the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-γ ligands in rats subjected to gastric I-R.
21373272:32	The next meaningful finding of the present study is that treatment with pioglitazone significantly inhibited I-R-driven activation of proinflammatory cytokines (CINC-1 and TNF-α) both in vivo (gastric mucosa) and in vitro (cultured gastric epithelial cells).
21373272:33	We demonstrated that, in I-R-induced gastric inflammation, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (CINC-1 and TNF-α) was enhanced in association with neutrophil accumulation, as determined by myeloperoxidase activity in the homogenate of the stomach.
21373272:34	() These results suggest a transcriptional mechanism by which PPAR-γ agonists may protect against gastric mucosal injury via an inhibition of cytokine production.
21373272:35	Finally, to investigate cytoprotective action by pioglitazone further, we compared the gene expression profiles between vehicle- and pioglitazone-treated gastric mucosal cells.
21373272:36	By the pathway analysis, we demonstrated the associated network that was significantly affected by pioglitazone.
21373272:37	The shown network was associated with cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and cancer.
21373272:38	This network includes CANX, ERP70, HSP60, HSPA5, HSPCA, and PSMB4 genes, and the mRNA expression of these genes were also confirmed by real-time PCR.
21373272:39	In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in the synthesis and maturation of a variety of important secretary and membrane proteins.
21373272:40	For glycoprotein, the ER possesses a dedicated maturation system, which assists folding and ensures the quality of final products before ER release.
21373272:41	Essential components of this system include the lectin chaperones CANX and calreticulin (CRT) and their associated co-chaperone ERP, a glycoprotein specific thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase.
21373272:42	() These data suggest that ER stress response induced by pioglitazone may be associated with its anti-inflammatory or cytoprotective actions on gastric mucosa.
21373272:43	This hypothesis is supported by a recent report, in which 15d-PGJ 2 a PPAR-γ ligand, induced ER stress, and that ER stress activation was associated with an attenuation of cytokine signaling in pancreatic β-cells.
21373272:44	()
In summary, we confirmed the expression of PPAR-γ in the rat gastric mucosa, and determined that the gastroprotective action of PPAR-γ ligand was dependent on the activation of the PPAR-γ receptor.
21373272:45	Finally, we demonstrated that DNA microarray was a highly effective way to generate a novel hypothesis on mechanism of action of PPAR-γ ligand.
21373272:46	In conclusion, activation of PPAR-γ may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the therapy of gastric inflammation.

16191200:0	Introduction 
Studies in both humans and animals indicate that lipid metabolism is altered in chronic lead exposure [ - ].
16191200:1	The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this lead-induced alterations are not completely understood.
16191200:2	Lead has been shown to accelerate lipid oxidation in the presence of hemoglobin or Fe 2+ . Lead was also shown to enhance Fe 2+-initiated lipid oxidation in liposomes, erythrocytes, microsomal fractions and rat brain homogenates [ , ].
16191200:3	Altered fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes has also been demonstrated in chronic lead exposure [ , ].
16191200:4	It has also been demonstrated that lead exposure affects levels of galactolipid metabolic enzymes in the developing rat brain resulting in myelin defects . All these observations are largely more suggestive than conclusive about lead-induced alterations in lipid metabolism.
16191200:5	Lead poisoning is presently becoming the most common disease of environmental origin and is increasing very rapidly in developing countries [ - ].
16191200:6	While lead exposure studies is a well-trodden subject in economically advanced countries [ - ], few published reports exist about lead poisoning and its associated effects in developing countries like Nigeria [ - ].
16191200:7	During the past years, numerous reports have appeared in the literature indicating that abnormal blood lipid levels like total cholesterol and other lipids and lipoproteins predispose individuals to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [ - ].
16191200:8	We have previously reported on chronic lead poisoning and its associated biochemical effects in auto-mechanics, petrol station attendants and some other artisans in Abeokuta, Nigeria [ - ].
16191200:9	To the best of our knowledge, data regarding the distribution of blood lipids and the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with this distribution in those who are occupationally exposed to lead in Nigeria, are lacking.
16191200:10	In order to gain an insight into lead exposure and its effects on lipid profiles, we investigated the distribution of blood lipids in various artisans in Abeokuta, Nigeria, who have been shown to be occupationally exposed to lead.
16191200:11	Subjects and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
During the past decade, a vast amount of evidence has confirmed that lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities play a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [ - ].
16191200:12	These chronic degenerative disorders have become a growing health problem worldwide.
16191200:13	In African populations, dyslipidemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and increasing incidents of death due to cardiovascular disease in both urbanised and underdeveloped rural countries have been reported . There is also increasing evidence that environmental factors contribute to this dyslipidemia . In this present study, we evaluated the distribution of some blood lipids in a population of artisans who are occupationally exposed to lead, an occupational and environmental pollutant.
16191200:14	We found that majority of the artisans had HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels not significantly different from controls.
16191200:15	On the contrary, total cholesterol levels in the artisans were between 1.5 and 2.0 times higher than controls.
16191200:16	In addition, LDL cholesterol in some of the artisans was considerably higher when compared with controls.
16191200:17	To our knowledge, the distribution of blood lipids in artisans in Nigeria has not been reported in the literature.
16191200:18	We were compelled to compare our data with the guidelines of risk factors for cardiovascular disease given by the American Heart Association . According to these guidelines, blood pressure < 130/85 mmHg; total cholesterol < 200 mg/dl; triglycerides < 200 mg/dl; HDL > 40 mg/dl and LDL < 130 mg/dl, are favourable risk factors.
16191200:19	In addition, certain lipid ratios like total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio also correlate with cardiovascular disease.
16191200:20	The recommended ratios for the two are ≤ 3.5 . Indications from this comparison are that while the HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of both the controls and artisans were within the acceptable range prescribed by the American Heart Association, the battery chargers with total cholesterol of 203.50 ± 48.51 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol of 147.00 ± 49.50 mg/dl, drivers with LDL cholesterol of 133.85 ± 81.69 mg/dl, and petrol station attendants with LDL cholesterol of 148.52 ± 29.62 mg/dl, seem to have unfavourable risk profiles for cardiovascular disease when compared with other artisans and control.
16191200:21	Furthermore, the LDL/HDL ratio of the artisans indicate that battery chargers, petrol station attendants and drivers seem to have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with other artisans and controls.
16191200:22	As regards total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, the auto-mechanics, battery chargers, drivers, panel beaters, petrol station attendants, spare parts/oil sellers and upholsterers, seem to be at risk of cardiovascular disease.
16191200:23	Although cholesterol levels are lower in African population when compared with their American counterparts , the findings of the present investigation indicate that exposure to lead alters the metabolism of cholesterol and thus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in lead-exposed subjects.
16191200:24	Although correlations do not imply causality, the observation of a positive relationship between lead and total cholesterol on one hand, and lead and LDL cholesterol on the other hand, seems to support these experimental findings.
16191200:25	HDL and LDL are two of the four main groups of plasma lipoproteins that are involved in lipid metabolism and the exchange of cholesterol, cholesterol ester and triglycerides between tissues [ - ].
16191200:26	Numerous population studies have shown an inverse correlation between plasma HDL levels and risk of cardiovascular disease, implying that factors associated with HDL protect against atherosclerosis.
16191200:27	Some of these factors appear to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects which may obviate processes that initiate atherogenesis . Epidemiological studies have also shown that elevated concentrations of total or LDL cholesterol in the blood are powerful risk factors for coronary disease . Most extra-hepatic tissues, although having a requirement for cholesterol, have low activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.
16191200:28	Their cholesterol requirements are supplied by LDL, which is internalised by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
16191200:29	A major function of HDL cholesterol is to enhance reverse cholesterol transport by scavenging excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues followed by esterification through lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and delivering it to the liver and steroidogenic organs for subsequent synthesis of bile acids and lipoproteins and eventual elimination from the body . This role of HDL has been shown to be responsible for its atheroprotective properties.
16191200:30	HDL cholesterol also regulates the exchange of proteins and lipids between various lipoproteins . In addition, HDL provides the protein components required to activate lipoprotein lipase which releases fatty acids that can be oxidised by the β-oxidation pathway to release energy [ - ].
16191200:31	Most importantly, HDL can inhibit oxidation of LDL as well as the atherogenic effects of oxidised LDL by virtue of its antioxidant property . The observation of increased total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, and normal HDL cholesterol levels in the artisans in this study suggests that reverse cholesterol transport in these artisans was not affected by lead exposure, rather cholesterol synthesis and transport to the peripheral tissues might be affected.
16191200:32	It is possible that lead increases the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis) and reduces the number/affinity of LDL receptors for cholesterol.
16191200:33	Further studies that we are pursuing in this laboratory are addressing this hypothesis.
16191200:34	Exposure to lead has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of hypertension  and this is supported by experimental animal studies in several species as well as epidemiological studies of blood pressure in relation to blood lead levels [ - ].
16191200:35	Most, but not all, of the studies have demonstrated that blood lead increases from 10 to 25 μg/dl are associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure increases of 1.4–8 mmHg and 1.2–4 mmHg, respectively .
16191200:36	Mean blood lead levels observed in the artisans in this study were between 2.5 and 3.0 times higher than control subjects.
16191200:37	Even though job experience indicated that lead exposure has been going on in these artisans for 4 to 26 years, only the auto-electricians had a borderline high systolic blood pressure as prescribed by the American Heart Association.
16191200:38	It remains to be established in these artisans the threshold value of blood lead that might be associated with increased blood pressure.
16191200:39	In addition to blood lipids, other factors such as age, physical activity, genetics, body composition, alcohol intake, tobacco use and body fat distribution, contribute significantly to risk of cardiovascular disease . All the subjects who participated in this study were non-smokers and all consume cassava-based meal as their carbohydrate source.
16191200:40	Alcohol intake was limited to only six of the auto-mechanics who consume 1 bottle of beer per day.
16191200:41	By virtue of the demands of their occupations, most of the artisans are physically active and this might account for the normal levels of HDL cholesterol observed in them . The anthropometric parameters measured in the artisans did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the control subjects and artisans, thus suggesting that these factors may not play any significant role in the dyslipidemia observed in these artisans.
16191200:42	The increased plasma cholesterol levels observed in these artisans raises a few questions.
16191200:43	Since erythrocyte cholesterol reflects plasma cholesterol, it might be interesting to investigate cholesterol levels in the erythrocytes in lead exposure and how this affects cholesterol:phospholipid ratio in both plasma and erythrocytes.
16191200:44	The consequences of these alterations might probably explain alterations observed in cation fluxes in the erythrocyte membrane in lead exposure.
16191200:45	Studies going on at present in this laboratory are directed towards addressing these questions.

Discussion 
In FDNY-FFs—all highly exposed to WTC dust and combustion/pyrolysis products during the morning of the collapse and nearly all with additional cumulative workday exposures to WTC dust—IS analysis were significantly different from controls, in inflammation (percentages of neutrophils and eosinophils that increased with exposure intensity; increased MMP-9) and particulate matter deposition (a shift in PSD toward larger size particles and chemical/mineral analysis consistent with WTC dust).
15531443:1	It is not surprising to find abnormalities in lung particulate matter and inflammation months after exposure.
15531443:2	After chronic occupational exposures, IS has shown increased eosinophil counts in sensitized asthmatics ( ; ) and in asbestos, radon, and uranium workers.
15531443:3	Asbestos bodies and particles with abnormal chemical compositions have been observed in IS years after exposure ( ; ; ).
15531443:4	Firefighters are exposed to numerous irritants (e.g., combustion and pyrolysis products, particulate matter), and such exposures have the potential to alter lung permeability ( ; ).
15531443:5	Inflammatory changes have been documented in BAL from nonsmoking firefighters compared with healthy volunteers ( ; ).
15531443:6	In a previous case report, we found an eosinophilic inflammatory response (70% of total cell count) and increased levels of interleukin-5 in the BAL of an FDNY-FF with acute pneumonitis several weeks after repeated WTC dust exposures.
15531443:7	The present study is the first to use IS to characterize differential cell counts, inflammation, particle size deposition, and composition in subjects with WTC exposures.
15531443:8	It is also the first to report these findings in firefighters.
15531443:9	IS from FDNY-FFs and TA-FFs, all never smokers, had increased percentages of eosinophils and neutrophils compared with healthy nonfirefighter controls.
15531443:10	For FDNY-FFs, a significant dose–response relationship was demonstrated, with the proportions of neutrophils and eosinophils increasing as cumulative WTC exposure intensity increased (measured in number of days working at WTC).
15531443:11	Neutrophils and eosinophils are important components of the inflammatory cascade responsible for airway inflammation, injury, and remodeling ( ; ; ).
15531443:12	The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases with a central role in inflammation and combined ability to degrade components of connective tissue matrices.
15531443:13	MMPs are synthesized and secreted by connective tissue and some hematopoietic cells, and are known to be important mediators of airway inflammation, remodeling, and pulmonary injury ( ; ).
15531443:14	We chose to measure MMP-9 because it a ) plays an important role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung; b ) is detectable in IS with reliable and reproducible results ( ; ); and c ) is increased in IS from workers exposed to hazardous dust.
15531443:15	We found a trend for higher levels of MMP-9 in IS samples from FDNY-FFs than in those from TA-FFs, and both groups were significantly higher than nonfirefighter controls.
15531443:16	Moreover, we found a positive correlation between accumulation of neutrophils and MMP-9 levels.
15531443:17	In these non-smoking firefighters, the increase in MMP-9 levels provides biochemical evidence for exposure-related immune activation in the lung, complementing the evidence from IS differential cell counts.
15531443:18	Persistent inflammation, 10 months after the WTC collapse, is consistent with the clinical findings of new and persistent cough, airway hyperreactivity, and asthma previously reported in FDNY-FFs ( ; ; ) and other rescue workers ( ; ; ) after exposures to WTC dust.
15531443:19	PSD measurements demonstrated significant differences between FDNY-FF and TA-FF IS samples.
15531443:20	We found a high load of relatively large particles (1–50 μm in diameter) with irregularly shaped structures in FDNY-FF IS samples that were completely different from the smaller, regular shaped particles found in TA-FF IS samples.
15531443:21	Chemical and mineral analyses also demonstrated differences between FDNY-FF and TA-FF IS samples.
15531443:22	TA-FF IS showed findings typical of soil contaminants from the Tel-Aviv area.
15531443:23	In contrast, a heterogeneous mixture was found in FDNY-FF IS, consistent with exposures to aerosolized building debris and dust and smoke generated by the collapse and fires.
15531443:24	Mineral particles were seen in macrophages and epithelial cells.
15531443:25	The presence of these particles in epithelial cells illustrates the high concentration of respirable particulate matter, overwhelming normal nasopharyngeal filtering, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar macrophage defense systems.
15531443:26	Although asbestos fibers were found in the BAL from the FDNY-FFs with eosinophilic pneumonitis after WTC exposure, we did not find asbestos fibers in our FDNY-FF IS samples.
15531443:27	Despite our finding significant correlations between inflammation and cumulative WTC exposure and significant differences in PSD between FDNY-FFs and TA-FFs, we could not detect a significant effect of cumulative WTC exposure on PSD.
15531443:28	This may be related to other physical factors at the WTC site, such as differences in work location, minute ventilation (related to subject size, physical fitness, experience, and work tasks), specific work task–related exposures, and the use of respiratory protection (minimal during week one and variable thereafter).
15531443:29	It may also reflect potential limitations of scoring cumulative exposure only in terms of workdays, unweighted for the above differences and other variables such as environmental conditions.
15531443:30	Additionally, selection bias (all FDNY-FF subjects volunteered for this study) may have influenced our current ability to detect the effect of cumulative exposure.
15531443:31	However, the strengths of this study outweigh these limitations and include the following: a ) all FDNY-FFs had significant WTC dust exposures because they were caught in the dust cloud during the collapse and then continued to work at the WTC site for days thereafter; b ) IS provided an assessment of persistent inflammation and cumulative particle deposition because the enormity of the disaster prevented us from collecting IS until 10 months after the collapse; c ) IS assessments were not biased toward acute, transient inflammation and particle deposition because at least 1 month had elapsed between collecting IS and the last workday at the WTC site; and d ) controls were truly unexposed because they were recruited from outside this region—a necessity because by this time nearly every FDNY-FF and most other rescue workers and many Manhattan residents had reported some level of exposure.
15531443:32	We believe the differences between FDNY-FFs, TA-FFs, and controls demonstrate a unique exposure following the WTC collapse ( and ).
15531443:33	This conclusion is supported by similarities between quantitative and qualitative analyses of IS sputum samples and dust samples collected from settled material one block east of the WTC.
15531443:34	These dust samples demonstrate a complex mixture of coarse particles and fibers consisting of relatively larger particles (> 90% of dust particle mass was > 10 μm in diameter).
15531443:35	Thus, the fact that IS samples from FDNY-FFs had higher amounts of particles > 2.0 μm in diameter than samples from TA-FFs was due to the nature and composition of the sources that dominated FDNY-FF exposure patterns.
15531443:36	In 87% of FDNY-FFs, > 20% of the particles found in IS were > 2.0 μm in diameter compared with only 8% of those from TA-FFs.
15531443:37	SEM also showed relatively larger and more irregularly shaped particles in FDNY-FFs compared with TA-FFs.
15531443:38	Once inhaled, particles > 2.0 μm in diameter are most commonly deposited in the upper airways, causing significant irritation because of their alkaline, caustic nature; this explains the increased incidence of upper airway symptoms (nasal congestion/drip, throat irritation, cough, and gastroesophageal reflux) described in highly and moderately exposed FDNY-FFs ( ; ; ).
15531443:39	Although helpful, measurements obtained from settled dust samples, which are often enriched with larger particles, are not entirely representative of the particle types or size distribution of aerosolized, potentially respirable dust during the height of exposure.
15531443:40	In fact, the majority of particles in FDNY-FF IS samples were < 2.0 μm in diameter: 74% of FDNY-FFs had > 60% of PSD < 2.0 μm in diameter.
15531443:41	Compared with settled WTC dust samples, FDNY-FF IS samples demonstrated a distinct leftward shift of the average curve of all PSD measurements toward smaller particles.
15531443:42	Particles 2.0 μm in diameter are commonly deposited in the smaller airways.
15531443:43	This may explain why post-WTC FDNY-FFs ( ; ) have shown an increased incidence of bronchial hyperreactivity, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and asthma.
15531443:44	Six months after the WTC collapse, methacholine challenge testing demonstrated that highly exposed FDNY rescue workers were 6.8 times more likely to have bronchial hyper-reactivity than moderately exposed and unexposed FDNY controls.
15531443:45	Our findings support both the practical utility and scientific usefulness of IS as a non-invasive method for screening and follow-up monitoring of populations exposed to high concentrations of aerosolized particulates following a disaster—natural or man-made.
15531443:46	IS is superior to BAL because it is noninvasive and collection can occur at nearly any field location.
15531443:47	In contrast to traditional blood and urine biomonitoring, IS directly samples the lung, the specific target organ of interest following an inhalation exposure.
15531443:48	For example, blood and urine samples were collected 1 month after the collapse in a different group of FDNY-FFs, and only a few of the 110 chemicals measured showed significant, yet small, differences when WTC-exposed FDNY-FFs were compared with nonexposed FDNY-FFs.
15531443:49	In contrast, IS directly assesses respired particulate matter and pulmonary inflammation, thereby serving an important complementary role to traditional biomonitoring techniques.
15531443:50	In conclusion, IS from FDNY-FFs caught in the WTC dust cloud during the morning of the collapse showed an influx of inflammatory cells, percentages of neutrophils and eosinophils that increased with exposure intensity, increased MMP-9 levels, a shift in PSD toward larger-size particles, and chemical/mineral analyses consistent with exposure to building debris, smoke, and dust generated by the attack on the WTC.
15531443:51	If future population studies demonstrate that IS measures of inflammation or PSD correlate with health outcomes, then IS evaluations would be a valuable addition to medical screening/monitoring programs following inhalation exposures.
14769848:0	GABA in the Endocrine Pancreas 
γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a principal nonpeptidal neurotransmitter with a well-characterized role as an inhibitor of neuronal firing in the CNS ( ; ).
14769848:1	GABA is also found in other tissues, such as the endocrine pancreas.
14769848:2	In the neuron, GABA is synthesized in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, it is produced from glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then transported into the synaptic vesicles against a proton electrochemical gradient.
14769848:3	Exocytosis of neuronal synaptic vesicles is triggered when voltage-sensitive calcium channels open, causing a transient increase in cytosolic calcium.
14769848:4	GABA is consequently released into the synaptic space, where it interacts with ionotropic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, increasing their chloride conductance and thereby inducing membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of exocytosis ( ; ).
14769848:5	However, when the electrochemical chloride gradient across the membrane is directed outward, as in neonatal hippocampal neurons, GABA is excitatory.
14769848:6	The endocrine pancreas also contains high concentrations of GABA, and the 65-kD isoform of GAD (GAD 65) predominantly in the core of the islets of Langerhans, where insulin-producing β-cells are located ( ; ; ).
14769848:7	For more than three decades the role of β-cell GABA has puzzled scientists, with interest intensifying on the discovery that GAD 65 is one of the major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes mellitus, a disease in which β-cells are systematically destroyed by an autoimmune mechanism.
14769848:8	Evidence suggests that β-cell GABA localizes to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) and is exocytosed in a regulated manner, as it is in neurons.
14769848:9	What are the stimuli for β-cell GABA release?
14769848:10	Which islet cell type/s are the targets of this fast-acting signaling molecule and what, if any, are its effects on hormone secretion?
14769848:11	These important questions have remained unanswered largely because of the difficulty in obtaining quantitative amounts of secreted GABA to detect temporal changes in GABA release.
14769848:12	A fresh approach to the detection of secreted GABA, providing both high temporal resolution and sensitivity, is presented by Braun and colleagues in this issue.
14769848:13	This new methodology and its application contribute a significant step toward the characterization of the mechanisms of β-cell GABA release and offers a platform for further studies of GABA stimulus-secretion coupling and SLMV exocytosis.
14769848:14	SLMVs in β-cells 
SLMVs have been identified in peptide-secreting endocrine cells, including those in the gut, adrenal chromaffin cells, and the pancreatic islets ( ; ).
14769848:15	These microvesicles are classified as synaptic-like because they contain membrane proteins involved in neuronal synaptic vesicle exocytosis, including synaptophysin, the vSNARE (vesicular soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) synaptobrevin-2, and the putative calcium sensor synaptotagmin I/II ( ; ; ).
14769848:16	Other proteins implicated in the regulation of exocytosis, e.g., SNAP25, syntaxin I, and Rab3, have been identified in β-cells and derived cell lines.
14769848:17	Ultrastructural studies have previously demonstrated that β-cell SLMVs are distinct in both appearance and size from the insulin-containing large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) ( ; ).
14769848:18	Now, provide quantitative information and show that a proportion of these SLMVs appear to be localized in abundance at the plasma membrane, with some vesicles apparently docked.
14769848:19	The striking similarity between β-cell SLMVs and neuronal synaptic vesicle morphology, subcellular distribution and the overlap in exocytosis-associated membrane proteins suggests that they may share a role as vehicles for storage and release of signaling molecules.
14769848:20	GABA Is Synthesized in β-cells 
An extensive body of research has demonstrated that GABA is present in high levels within pancreatic islets, and that the majority is localized to the β-cells, although small amounts are also detected in the islet mantle (for review see ; ).
14769848:21	GABA is synthesized in the cytosol from its precursor glutamate by GAD.
14769848:22	Glutamate is generated in the mitochondria, either from the TCA-cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase or by other transamination reactions.
14769848:23	Glutamate is then transferred to the cytosol, where it can also be produced by glutaminolysis.
14769848:24	GABA catabolism occurs in the mitochondria where GABA is transaminated with α-ketoglutarate by GABA transaminase to form succinate semialdehyde.
14769848:25	This has been referred to as the GABA shunt.
14769848:26	β-cells express high levels of GAD 65, the membrane-associated isoform of GAD, which is also linked with synaptic vesicles in neurons ( ; ).
14769848:27	High levels of GAD activity have indeed been detected in islets.
14769848:28	GAD 67, another isoform of GAD, exhibits different subcellular localization to GAD 65 in β-cells and neurons.
14769848:29	This isoform has been identified in rat but not in human or mouse islets ( ; ).
14769848:30	In rat, GAD 67 appears to be more abundant in the islet mantle, where glucagon-secreting α-cells and somatostatin-secreting δ-cells predominate, rather than in the β-cell containing core, where GAD 65 is exclusively localized.
14769848:31	However, it should be noted that endocrine cells might not be the only source of islet GABA in vivo and in some experimental systems, such as isolated islets and in situ perfused pancreas.
14769848:32	The presence of GABAergic neurons, closely associated with, and indeed penetrating into the islet mantle, has been confirmed by immunocytochemistry.
14769848:33	Is β-cell GABA Localized within SLMVs?
14769848:34	Although a direct demonstration of GABA localization in β-cell SLMVs by immunogold electron microscopy is lacking, such analyses have thus far indicated that GABA is concentrated in regions enriched with SLMVs and indeed excluded from LDCVs ( this issue).
14769848:35	Moreover, GAD 65 clearly colocalizes with β-cell SLMV membrane proteins, as it does with synaptic vesicles in neurons, strongly supporting the notion that GABA is transported into SLMVs once synthesized.
14769848:36	Uptake studies of radio-labeled GABA by purified SLMVs of the β-cell line βTC3 have revealed an ATP-dependent proton ionophore-sensitive GABA uptake mechanism, similar to that observed in neuronal synaptic vesicles.
14769848:37	A similar demonstration of ATP-dependent GABA uptake was made in permeabilized RIN 38 cells, a pancreatic β-cell line.
14769848:38	The only fly in the ointment is that the GABA/glycine transporter VGAT (VIAAT), initially characterized in GABAergic neuronal cells, was recently identified in rat, but not human islets.
14769848:39	Moreover, the VGAT expression pattern paralleled that of GAD 67, being more abundant in the islet mantle than the core.
14769848:40	It is possible that β-cells utilize an alternative transporter for GABA uptake into SLMVs, which displays similar properties to the neuronal vesicular transporter.
14769848:41	Despite the lack of a molecular identity for the β-cell vesicular GABA transporter, it seems that GABA is in all probability stored in, and exocytosed from, SLMVs, as has become increasingly evident from studies of GABA secretion, discussed below.
14769848:42	Regulated GABA Release from β-cells 
Synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons occurs by regulated rather than constitutive exocytosis, in response to a transient rise in cytosolic calcium.
14769848:43	Is β-cell GABA also released by a regulated process?
14769848:44	Studies of GABA release have until now required large amounts of starting material, usually cell lines, to obtain sufficient amounts of secreted GABA for quantitative analysis.
14769848:45	These studies have revealed that in the β-cell line RIN 38, and the neuroendocrine cell line BON, GABA secretion can be stimulated by high concentrations of extracellular K +, or the calcium ionophore A23187, both dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium ( ; ).
14769848:46	GABA release from BON cells was also stimulated twofold by the cAMP-raising agent IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
14769848:47	This suggests that, like insulin secretion, GABA is released in response to an increase in cytosolic calcium, as a result of membrane depolarization, which triggers the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels.
14769848:48	Other studies in MIN6 cells, a widely used mouse β-cell line, have shown that GABA release can be stimulated up to threefold by mastoparan, a wasp venom peptide that activates G-proteins and stimulates LDCV exocytosis.
14769848:49	Moreover, mastoparan-stimulated GABA release was attenuated by the tetanus toxin C1 light chain, a neurotoxin that cleaves synaptobrevin-2.
14769848:50	In contrast, overexpression of the t-SNARES SNAP 25 or syntaxin IA inhibited mastoparan-induced insulin secretion but not GABA release.
14769848:51	These findings imply that regulated GABA release involves similar but not identical mechanisms to those of insulin secretion.
14769848:52	Both of these processes appear to involve machinery implicated in neurotransmitter release.
14769848:53	The notion that β-cell GABA release is a regulated process has been reinforced by using dispersed rat islets.
14769848:54	The authors employed an adenoviral system to overexpress the GABA A receptor, a GABA-activated Cl − channel, as a novel detection system for GABA release.
14769848:55	To this end, whole-cell patch-clamped β-cells were used as biosensors for their own secreted GABA, detected as fluctuations in current (current transients).
14769848:56	The authors show that GABA release occurred in response to membrane depolarization, dependent on the entry of extracellular calcium through Cd 2+-sensitive (voltage-gated) channels.
14769848:57	The release of caged calcium in GABA A receptor overexpressing β-cells also induced an increase in transient currents associated with receptor activation.
14769848:58	These findings demonstrate that calcium entry through voltage-gated channels, and not membrane depolarization itself, can trigger GABA release.
14769848:59	Interestingly, when the concentration of calcium within the pipette solution was increased from 3–25 μM, a twofold increase in GABA A-mediated current changes and a similar increase in total membrane capacitance was observed.
14769848:60	As the authors state, an increase in cell capacitance is largely reflective of exocytosis of LDCVs rather than SLMVs (<2% of total increase).
14769848:61	However, this does not necessarily indicate that the same calcium sensor is involved in GABA (SLMV) and LDCV release, as the sensors identity and detailed calcium-dose response relationships remain to be established.
14769848:62	It was also noted that depolarization-induced current changes rapidly desensitized, but recovered after a 2-min break in trains of depolarizations.
14769848:63	This supports a vesicular origin for GABA, perhaps within readily releasable and reserve SLMV pools, compatible with their ultrastructural findings.
14769848:64	In agreement with the stimulatory effect of IBMX on GABA release from neuroendocrine cell lines, the presence of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, increased the number of depolarization-induced GABA release events detected.
14769848:65	Therefore, cAMP acts as a potentiator not only of LDCV, but also SLMV exocytosis.
14769848:66	Does High Glucose Stimulate β-cell GABA Release?
14769848:67	An important question when considering the role of GABA as an intraislet paracrine signaling molecule must be whether islet GABA secretion is stimulated, as insulin, or inhibited during post-prandial hyperglycemia.
14769848:68	Glucose metabolism stimulates LDCV exocytosis by depolarizing the plasma membrane, which promotes calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels.
14769848:69	Many authors who believe GABA secretion is stimulated by glucose have relied on an early paper demonstrating an increase in GABA release from the β-cell line βTC6 only apparent after a long (total of 12 h) exposure to high glucose.
14769848:70	However, such a prolonged exposure to high glucose may have altered the expression of the enzymes involved in GABA metabolism, or SNARES involved in SMLV exocytosis.
14769848:71	Moreover, a concurrent increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion was not demonstrated, questioning the validity of this cell line as a model for primary β-cells.
14769848:72	In another paper where the widely accepted β-cell model, MIN6, was used, no significant increase in GABA release was observed after a 2-h incubation in high glucose, contrasting with a twofold stimulation of insulin secretion, also reported in a later study.
14769848:73	A mere handful of studies have addressed the question of glucose-stimulated GABA secretion in primary pancreatic preparations.
14769848:74	Increased GABA release in the presence of high glucose was detected using pieces of rabbit pancreas.
14769848:75	After 15 min, a twofold increase in secreted GABA was observed.
14769848:76	However, a convincing demonstration of glucose-induced insulin secretion was again lacking in this study.
14769848:77	In contrast, a later investigation showed inhibition (40%) of GABA release from reaggregated rat β-cells after a 2-h (or 24-h) culture period in high when compared with low glucose conditions.
14769848:78	A threefold increase in insulin secretion was observed in parallel.
14769848:79	In agreement with this finding, a second study demonstrated a twofold increase in GABA release from rat islets after 30 min when islets were transferred from high to low glucose conditions.
14769848:80	A concurrent decrease in insulin secretion was confirmed.
14769848:81	The overall trend from these studies is not clear and so the effect of glucose on GABA release remains inconclusive.
14769848:82	However, the function of GABA in the CNS as a fast-acting signaling molecule should be considered.
14769848:83	All of the aforementioned studies examined GABA release after a relatively long incubation time (minutes to hours), which might be inappropriate for analyzing physiologically relevant GABA secretion.
14769848:84	The new approach by enables GABA exocytosis to be monitored in real-time over milliseconds to seconds.
14769848:85	Although glucose-induced GABA secretion was not demonstrated directly by it was inferred by the ability of a depolarization-induced calcium rise to elicit GABA secretion.
14769848:86	Their GABA biosensor approach could be used to directly substantiate the effect of glucose by patch clamp monitoring of membrane currents in “sniffer” cells, overexpressing the GABA A receptor, but located adjacent to normal β-cells.
14769848:87	“Sniffer” cells would not be anticipated to sense glucose as they would be patched in whole-cell mode.
14769848:88	Superfusion with high glucose could stimulate GABA release from control cells, and in turn activate the GABA A receptors on the “sniffer” cells.
14769848:89	GABA Receptor Expression in the Endocrine Pancreas 
There are two distinct types of GABA receptors in the CNS, the ionotropic GABA A (a chloride channel) and GABA C receptors, and the metabotropic GABA B receptor.
14769848:90	GABA B is a G-protein coupled receptor that can suppress presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
14769848:91	This involves the direct inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, or the reduction of postsynaptic neuron firing by indirectly activating Kir3-type potassium channel subunits and inhibiting adenylate cyclase via G-protein subunits.
14769848:92	It is widely accepted that GABA A receptor is expressed in the islet.
14769848:93	However, exactly which islet cell types express this receptor is still to be elucidated.
14769848:94	In whole human islets, the α2, β3 and γ1 subunits of the GABA A receptor were detected by RT-PCR, a more limited spectrum than in the brain (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–2), perhaps indicative of only one pharmacologically distinct receptor or expression in just one cell type.
14769848:95	In the rat islet, however, antibodies against α1 and 2 and β1 and γ2 all strongly stained all cell types.
14769848:96	Immunostaining of guinea pig pancreatic islets indicated that GABA A receptors are expressed in α and δ, but not β-cells.
14769848:97	GABA B receptors have been detected by both RT-PCR and Western blotting in whole human islets and MIN6 cells.
14769848:98	In view of the apparent discrepancies between species, detailed islet cell-type specific molecular profiling of GABA receptors should be performed.
14769848:99	GABA Action on Islet Hormone Release 
The existence of large amounts of GABA in β-cells, the likelihood that it is released from SLMVs in a regulated manner, and the presence of GABA receptors on neighboring islet cells strongly suggests a signaling role for GABA within the microorgan.
14769848:100	Does GABA act as a modulator of islet hormone release by auto and/or paracrine actions?
14769848:101	In vivo, insulin is secreted from β-cells and somatostatin from δ-cells during hyperglycaemia, whereas α-cells are active in the hypoglycaemic state.
14769848:102	The evidence presented below advocates that insulin secretion may be inhibited by GABA.
14769848:103	In the perfused rat pancreas, where islet microcirculation is preserved, glucose-induced insulin secretion was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both GABA and baclofen (a GABA B-specific agonist), indicative of GABA action by the GABA B receptor.
14769848:104	The underlying mechanism for this could be the attenuation of the glucose-evoked increase in cytosolic calcium, as seen in isolated β-cells.
14769848:105	In a separate study, muscimol (a GABA A receptor agonist) had no effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion in the perfused rat pancreas, despite a concurrent inhibition of somatostatin release.
14769848:106	These findings indicate that GABA A receptors may be expressed on delta but not β-cells, in agreement with receptor localization studies in guinea pig islets discussed above.
14769848:107	Surprisingly, however, GABA had no effect on arginine-stimulated somatostatin release from isolated guinea pig islets.
14769848:108	This discrepancy between results from isolated islets and perfused pancreata has also been seen for insulin secretion.
14769848:109	In studies of rat islets, GABA, muscimol, or baclofen had no effect on insulin or somatostatin release.
14769848:110	Such findings are consistent with the concept that GABA may act as an autocrine inhibitor of insulin secretion, at least in rodents.
14769848:111	There is evidence to suggest that in some species GABA can inhibit the secretion of the blood-glucose–elevating hormone glucagon.
14769848:112	In studies of isolated islets, GABA has been shown to inhibit arginine-induced glucagon release in guinea pig islets and glucagon release from mouse islets.
14769848:113	In the latter experiment, the same result was obtained with muscimol, but not bacolfen, indicative of GABA action via the GABA A receptor.
14769848:114	Importantly, muscimol was also found to inhibit arginine-induced glucagon secretion in the perfused rat pancreas.
14769848:115	In the αTC6 cell-line, glucagon secretion was inhibited by GABA in a dose-dependent manner, in low (1 mM) but not in high (10 mM) glucose.
14769848:116	Under the latter condition, glucagon secretion appeared to be already maximally inhibited.
14769848:117	These findings lead us to the interesting possibility that GABA might act as a paracrine inhibitor of glucagon secretion in high glucose conditions, as previously proposed.
14769848:118	GABA as a Paracrine Regulator of Glucagon Secretion 
In conditions where β-cell insulin secretion is stimulated by nutrients, glucagon release is suppressed.
14769848:119	In vivo, this situation occurs during hyperglycaemia, but is known to be deranged in the diabetic state where insulin secretion is impaired.
14769848:120	The concept of paracrine regulation of glucagon secretion by secretory products from β-cell LDCVs, has recently been addressed.
14769848:121	Candidate paracrine inhibitors include insulin and zinc, the latter cocrystallizes with insulin in LDCVs.
14769848:122	To also qualify as a paracrine inhibitor during hyperglycemia, GABA must be released under high glucose conditions.
14769848:123	Given the ability of GABA to hyperpolarize the plasma membrane of neuronal cells, a similar effect on the α-cell plasma membrane could be envisaged to have an inhibitory effect on exocytosis of glucagon-containing LDCVs.
14769848:124	Indeed GABA hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and concurrent inhibition of spontaneous calcium spiking has been demonstrated with the cell-attached patch clamp technique in isolated guinea pig α-cells.
14769848:125	It is noteworthy that the fundamentals of voltage-gated calcium influx–dependent LDCV exocytosis are similar in α- and β-cells.
14769848:126	Indirect evidence for a hyperpolarization effect of GABA on stimulated rat β-cells has been reported.
14769848:127	Evidence for paracrine suppression of glucagon secretion by GABA during glucose stimulation remains controversial.
14769848:128	The GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline was unable to prevent high glucose-associated inhibition of arginine-induced glucagon secretion in the perfused rat pancreas.
14769848:129	This finding is significant in view of the preserved islet microcirculation in the perfused pancreas set-up (see below).
14769848:130	Only one study has demonstrated an antagonistic effect of bicuculline (50%) on high glucose-associated inhibition of glucagon secretion in the guinea pig islet.
14769848:131	However, the action of bicuculline on glucagon release in low glucose conditions was not explored, and indeed a stimulatory effect of bicuculline on somatostatin release from the same islets exposed to low glucose and arginine was observed.
14769848:132	This raises the possibility that interstitial GABA may have acted as an inhibitor of glucagon secretion in both low and high glucose conditions.
14769848:133	It is clear, therefore, that the actions of GABA on islet hormone release need to be elucidated.
14769848:134	Islet GABA and Glutamate as Paracrine Effectors 
Evidence suggests that the LDCVs of α-cells contain glutamate.
14769848:135	This is suggested by the colocalization of the glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 with glucagon-positive secretory granules and L-glutamate.
14769848:136	Glutaminase, usually enriched in glutaminergic nerve endings, was also detected in α-cells.
14769848:137	L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, and like GABA, is stored and released from synaptic vesicles.
14769848:138	Activation of ionotropic L-glutamate receptors has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion from rat islets at permissive glucose concentrations, whereas GABA release was evoked at low glucose concentrations.
14769848:139	Glutamate is also present in β-cells, generated from glucose, and thought to participate as an intracellular cofactor in nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion.
14769848:140	The colocalization of glutamate with glucagon could suggest that any intraislet glutamate paracrine signaling activity occurs during hypoglycaemia, as supported by the observation that glutamate release from islets is greater in low rather than high glucose conditions.
14769848:141	In contrast, the distinct partitioning of GABA and insulin within the β-cell to the SLMVs and LDCVs, respectively, confers possibilities for tailored stimulatory and inhibitory signaling pathways for exocytosis.
14769848:142	Paracrine signaling in the in situ islet is dictated by the direction of the microcirculation.
14769848:143	It is generally believed that the intraislet portal system places the α and δ-cells, situated in the islet mantle, downstream of the β-cells in the core.
14769848:144	This is supported by the observation that glucagon secretion is suppressed when β-cells are activated and α-cell hyperfunction in the absence of β-cells.
14769848:145	What roles can be envisaged for the two candidate signaling molecules GABA and glutamate in the short-term regulation of islet hormone secretion?
14769848:146	Under conditions where both SLMV and LDCV exocytosis is stimulated, GABA could act as an autocrine inhibitor of insulin secretion.
14769848:147	In this situation, GABA may well act as a paracrine inhibitor of glucagon and somatostatin release (see ).
14769848:148	Glutamate, however, is a conceptually less attractive paracrine regulator of β-cell vesicular exocytosis in the light of our current understanding of islet microcirculation.
14769848:149	We anticipate that these outstanding questions of islet physiology, including the puzzle of islet GABA function, will be resolved with the aid of the many biophysical and genetic tools now available, in particular the biosensor approach to detecting GABA release.

17537234:0	Introduction 
Cartilage is frequently damaged by trauma and in disease but shows only a limited capacity for repair.
17537234:1	Most focal cartilage lesions, left untreated, progress to more extensive lesions and in the long term these require joint arthroplasty.
17537234:2	Autologous chondrocytes harvested from low-weight-bearing areas of articular cartilage are being used for the repair of focal hyaline cartilage defects .
17537234:3	Although short-term clinical results have been good, evidence suggests some incidence of progressive degenerative changes in the joint .
17537234:4	This procedure is also accompanied by donor site morbidity, and the limited amount of tissue available necessitates prolonged cell expansion.
17537234:5	There is therefore interest in alternative sources of adult stem cells for cell-based tissue engineering approaches for cartilage repair.
17537234:6	Cells with stem cell characteristics have been reported in many tissues and more recently in subcutaneous adipose tissue and the infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) [ - ].
17537234:7	Conditions for the differentiation of these cells into chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocytes have been used to show that they are multipotent . Because of their multipotency and practical access, cells from the IPFP are of interest as a potential source of cells for the repair of focal cartilage defects in the knee . In previous work we demonstrated the ability of IPFP-derived cells to undergo chondrogenic , osteogenic  and adipogenic differentiation (W.S.
17537234:8	Khan and T.E.
17537234:9	Hardingham, unpublished data).
17537234:10	Mammalian cells are normally cultured in air (containing 20% oxygen) with 5% carbon dioxide added, but some cells, including adult stem cells, have been reported to proliferate more rapidly at lower oxygen concentrations [ - ].
17537234:11	Articular cartilage is avascular and exists at a decreased oxygen tension of (1 to 7%) in vivo . In chondrocyte culture systems it has been shown that under hypoxia there is increased synthesis of extracellular matrix by chondrocytes , and this has been extended to stem cells from bone marrow  and liposuction-derived adipose tissue  undergoing chondrogenesis.
17537234:12	Thus, oxygen tension seems to be an important regulatory factor in the proliferation, differentiation and matrix production of chondrocytes, but few studies have characterised gene expression changes.
17537234:13	In our investigation of the potential of IPFP-derived stem cells from elderly patients undergoing joint replacement for osteoarthritis, we investigated the gene expression changes that characterised the response of these stem cells to hypoxic conditions in chondrogenic cultures.
17537234:14	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The cell surface epitope characterisation and flow cytometry of the IPFP cell population showed a similar staining pattern to that of bone marrow-derived stem cells, and although they stained poorly for STRO-1 and for LNGFR, the expression of these markers on bone marrow-derived stem cells is reported to decline with culture [ - ].
17537234:15	In preliminary work the cells have shown osteogenic  and adipogenic (W.S.
17537234:16	Khan and T.E.
17537234:17	Hardingham, unpublished data) differentiation.
17537234:18	It has also previously been noted that other adipose tissue-derived stem cells did not express STRO-1 . In IPFP tissue sections we have identified perivascular cells, which stained with the antibody 3G5 . The antigen recognised by 3G5 is a cell surface ganglioside, characterised originally on vascular pericytes from bovine retina, which have been shown to have multidifferentiation potential [ - ].
17537234:19	In the cultured IPFP cells only 3 to 7% stained positively for 3G5, and the fraction that stained did not change with further passage; we have also observed that with clonally expanded IPFP cells only a small proportion of the progeny of each stained with 3G5 (W.S.
17537234:20	Khan and T.E.
17537234:21	Hardingham, unpublished data), suggesting this was not a separate subpopulation.
17537234:22	These results suggested that the culture conditions did not favour 3G5 expression, and previously it has been reported to vary in culture .
17537234:23	It may therefore be possible that the IPFP cells isolated were derived from those staining with 3G5 in the tissue, but that in culture 3G5 was expressed on only few cells at any one time.
17537234:24	The IPFP cells responded to chondrogenic culture in cell aggregates, and this was much enhanced under hypoxic conditions.
17537234:25	The wet mass of cell aggregate provides a simple measure of in vitro chondrogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells ; cell aggregates cultured under hypoxic conditions had a 1.8-fold higher wet mass than those cultured under normoxia.
17537234:26	The GAG content reflected proteoglycan biosynthesis and accumulation in the matrix, and under hypoxic conditions there was a 1.9-fold increase in the total GAG per aggregate.
17537234:27	In spite of the increased mass there was a lower DNA content than under normoxia, reflecting a lower cell proliferation rate, and this was balanced by a much greater production of GAG per cell.
17537234:28	These results with IPFP cells are comparable to those from a previous study on stem cells derived from other human liposuction-derived adipose tissue, in which 5% oxygen was reported to increase collagen and GAG synthesis and reduce cell proliferation .
17537234:29	However, with mouse inguinal fat-derived cells, decreased chondrogenesis and osteogenesis was reported in 2% oxygen .
17537234:30	The effects of hypoxia on the propagation of human bone marrow-derived stem cells suggested that 2% oxygen favoured more primitive stem cells with higher colony-forming unit capability and stronger expression of stem cell genes, and that when switched to normoxic conditions they showed stronger osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation .
17537234:31	The gene expression analysis provided an assessment of the changes induced by hypoxia in the chondrogenic cultures, and the gene expression in monolayer culture provided a measure of expression before the cell aggregates were formed.
17537234:32	The transcription factor SOX9 has been shown to be essential for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation .
17537234:33	One of its actions is to activate specific enhancer elements in cartilage matrix genes such as collagen type II and aggrecan .
17537234:34	This action of SOX9 is further enhanced by SOX5 and SOX6.
17537234:35	In the chondrogenic cultures of IPFP cells there was an increase in the expression of SOX9, which was already expressed at a significant level and this was increased more strongly in hypoxia.
17537234:36	SOX5 and SOX6 showed different proportionate responses, as SOX5 was not increased under normoxia but was increased by hypoxia, whereas SOX6 was upregulated in normoxia and this was further enhanced by hypoxia.
17537234:37	The net effect was that under hypoxia there was higher expression of SOX5, 6 and 9 than under normoxic conditions.
17537234:38	The expression of key cartilage collagens II, IX and XI were all correspondingly increased under hypoxia, showing that hypoxia enhanced the potential for the assembly of a complete cartilage fibrillar template.
17537234:39	Although TGF-β inhibits the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes in vivo  there was also a higher level of collagen type X expression in IPFP chondrogenic cultures.
17537234:40	However, TGF-β has previously been associated with increased expression of collagen type X in chondrogenesis in bone marrow stem cells . Aggrecan, and to a smaller extent versican, were also increased in hypoxia.
17537234:41	The response by cells to hypoxia is complex and is mediated by several genes . HIF1α is one of the major regulators of hypoxic response in most cells and tissues , where it is frequently associated with angiogenesis and the formation of new blood vessels.
17537234:42	Targets of its molecular signalling are reported to include a cluster of hydroxylases that are crucial for collagen fibre formation such as prolyl 4-hydroxylase and procollagen lysyl-hydroxylase [ - ].
17537234:43	Through these actions, HIF1α affects the rate of synthesis of procollagen chains in vivo and in vitro . HIF2α is closely related to HIF1α, with similarities in DNA binding and dimerisation, but with differences in transactivation domains . The genes downstream of HIF2α have been less well characterised, but it seems to act through some of the pathways common to HIF1α.
17537234:44	Both genes are upregulated together in some cells, but many examples of selective activation of one or the other are known, and an increasing number of cell-type-specific gene targets have been identified .
17537234:45	It was therefore an important finding here that HIF2α and not HIF1α was upregulated in the IPFP cells in response to 5% oxygen.
17537234:46	It suggests that in chondrogenic IPFP cells the response to hypoxia is mediated by HIF2α and that this helps to drive the increased matrix production, assisted by increased expression of the hydroxylases necessary for collagen fibril formation.
17537234:47	It may be an important factor that this was the response in 5% oxygen, which is a low oxygen tension but within the physiological range for chondrocytes . In other chondrogenic systems we have noted reduced matrix production with cell aggregates in 1% oxygen (A.B.
17537234:48	Adesida and T.E.
17537234:49	Hardingham, unpublished data).
17537234:50	It has also been noted that only HIF2α, and not HIF1α, was upregulated in neuroblastoma cells cultured in 5% oxygen, whereas HIF1α and HIF2α were both upregulated when the oxygen tension was decreased to 1% . In the context of these cultures the oxygen concentration is 5% at the surface but is likely to be below 5% towards the centre of the aggregate.
17537234:51	It has also been noted that in prolonged hypoxia in lung epithelial cells, the upregulation of HIF1α was transient, whereas increases in HIF2α were sustained . A transient upregulation of HIF1α cannot be ruled out in these cultures, but the expression of HIF1α was much lower than HIF2α under all conditions (Figure ) and it is clear that at 14 days under hypoxic conditions HIF2α was expressed about 40-fold more than HIF1α.
17537234:52	The present results suggest that HIF2α expression in chondrogenic cells may act to selectively enhance the expression of the cartilage matrix genes.
17537234:53	However, this may be an indirect action through the increased expression of the transcription factors SOX9, SOX5 and SOX6.
17537234:54	The differential effect of hypoxia on the expression of the cartilage matrix genes suggests that the cartilage collagens may become actively expressed at lower levels of SOX9, SOX5 and SOX6 transcription factors, whereas aggrecan may require higher levels of SOX9, SOX5 and SOX6 to achieve full expression.
17537234:55	Conclusion 
Our results show that cells with stem cell or progenitor cell characteristics can be isolated from the IPFP derived from elderly patients with osteoarthritis.
17537234:56	Cells from each patient tested ( n = 3) showed the ability to undergo chondrogenic differentiation, and this was enhanced in 5% oxygen.
17537234:57	This is the first study that has characterised chondrogenic gene expression in IPFP-derived cells.
17537234:58	Our results extend previous observations and identify here most importantly that HIF2α, and not HIF1α, was upregulated in response to lowered oxygen tension in the chondrogenic cultures.
17537234:59	The results showed that chondrogenesis was enhanced in an atmosphere of decreased oxygen tension and that this is mediated by a significantly increased expression of key genes expressed by chondrocytes, notably the transcription factors SOX5, SOX6 and SOX9.
17537234:60	These findings show that oxygen tension has an important role in regulating the synthesis and assembly of matrix by IPFP-derived stem cells as they undergo chondrogenesis and that this has important implications for the use of the IPFP in cartilage tissue engineering.

19930627:0	Background 
Group A rotaviruses are the major etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.
19930627:1	More than 125 million infants and young children develop rotavirus diarrhea globally each year, resulting in 440.000
19930627:2	deaths in children, mostly in the developing countries .
19930627:3	Although the infant mortality rate due to rotavirus disease is low in developed countries, the consequences of the disease can be very costly and cause a significant economic burden, which can be both direct (medical costs, outpatient visits, diagnosis, medication) and indirect (lost working hours of parents).
19930627:4	For example, the costs associated with rotavirus diarrhea in the United States were estimated at $100-400 million to the healthcare system and $1 billion to the society . 
Extensive genetic variation and reassortment of the 11 double-stranded RNA rotaviral genome segments has resulted in the presence of a large spectrum of different rotavirus genotypes in humans and animals.
19930627:5	Rotaviruses, which form a separate genus in the family Reoviridae are divided into seven (A to G) antigenically distinct groups that infect mammalian and avian species, of which group A rotaviruses are the most important due to their high prevalence and pathogenicity in both mammalian and avian species.
19930627:6	Group A rotaviruses have a genome that is enclosed in a triple-layered icosahedral capsid, consisting of 11 segments encoding six viral structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6) . Like influenza viruses, a dual classification system for group A rotaviruses has been established depending on two outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7, defining respectively P en G genotypes.
19930627:7	Recently, a genotyping system based on complete nucleotide sequences of all 11 genomic RNA segments has been proposed by Matthijnssens and colleagues . In this new classification system, nucleotide identity cut-off percentages were defined to identify different genotypes for each of the 11 segments (Table ).
19930627:8	Likewise, a nomenclature for the comparison of complete rotavirus genomes was considered in which the notation Gx-P [x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx (with x indicating the number of the genotype) is used for the VP7, VP4, VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 encoding genes, respectively.
19930627:9	In this new group A rotavirus classification system, the complete open reading frame (ORF) of a rotavirus gene is compared to other complete ORFs of cognate genes available in the GenBank database.
19930627:10	If pairwise nucleotide identities between the gene of the novel strain under investigation (strain A) and the strains belonging to an established genotype X are above the cut off value of that gene segment (Table ), strain A can be assigned to genotype X.
19930627:11	The exact relationship between the gene of strain A and cognate genes of all established genotypes, has to be obtained phylogenetically.
19930627:12	When all the pairwise nucleotide identities between a gene of the new strain B, and the cognate genes of all the established genotypes are below the cut-off value for that gene segment (Table ), strain B may be the prototype of a new genotype . If only a partial ORF sequence of a rotavirus genome segment is available, assigning it to a specific genotype is less certain because the genotypic diversity across the ORF is not a constant value.
19930627:13	Some regions of the ORF may be highly variable, while others may be more conserved.
19930627:14	Since the cut-off percentage values for each of the 11 genome segments has been calculated based on entire ORFs, applying these cut-off percentages to only a part of the ORF, might lead to erroneous conclusions.
19930627:15	In accordance with the recommendations of the RCWG, only under certain circumstances when all three of the following restrictions are obeyed, a partial gene sequence might be used to assign a rotavirus gene to an established genotype: (a) at least 50% of the ORF sequence should be determined; (b) at least 500 nucleotides of the ORF should be determined; and (c) identity between strain X and a strain belonging to an established genotype A should be at least 2% above the appropriate cut-off sequence (Table ), before strain X can be assigned to genotype A.
19930627:16	Implementation 
The classification tool for group A rotaviruses (RotaC v1.0) is written in java with a simple object model in order to make it easy to maintain the code.
19930627:17	The interface of the website is written in perl.
19930627:18	The RotaC tool can analyze up to a 1000 nucleotide sequences in 'strict' FASTA-format (a first line with a sequence identifier preceded by '>', followed by a second line with the sequence).
19930627:19	The analysis of nucleotide sequences with a length below 500 bases is not suitable according to the RCWG guidelines and is not allowed in the RotaC tool.
19930627:20	The genotyping process consists of several subsequent steps.
19930627:21	In a first step, the appropriate gene segment is identified by comparing the query sequence with a full genome reference alignment consisting of well-characterized group A rotavirus sequences and by the neighbor-joining algorithm.
19930627:22	After the recognition of the segment of origin, the query sequence is aligned using the profile alignment functions of Clustal W v2.0 with a reference alignment of the appropriate segment (detailed information about the alignments used with the RotaC tool can be found on ).
19930627:23	In a second step, a distance matrix, based on pairwise alignments with the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm , and a phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor-joining algorithm using the Paup* software  are constructed and analyzed to identify the genotype of the query sequence by using the nucleotide identity cut-off values summarized in Table . The reliability of the clustering of the neighbor-joining tree is assessed using 100 bootstrap replicates, considering 70% as the cut-off value.
19930627:24	If the query sequence has a shared identity of at least 3% above the appropriate cut-off value with an established genotype, the query sequence is considered as a member of that specific genotype.
19930627:25	If the shared identity is at least 3% below the cut-off value, the query sequence is considered as a new genotype of the proper rotavirus segment.
19930627:26	For identities less than 3% below or above the cut-off value, the tool provides only tentative conclusions.
19930627:27	In this case, it is recommended to send the sequence to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group for further phylogenetic analysis and correct identification of the genotype.
19930627:28	For queries covering less than 50% of the ORF region, no conclusion will be drawn.
19930627:29	The user should pay attention that the assignment of a genotype to the query sequence with identities less than 3% below or above the genotype cut-off values should be confirmed by more extensive phylogenetic analysis, or should be send to the RCWG for further analyses and/or validation.
19930627:30	Results and Discussion 
Due to the very limited number of completely sequenced rotavirus genomes, studies on reassortments have been limited to a few gene segments.
19930627:31	Recently, the increased availability of complete rotavirus genome sequences, and the introduction of an extended classification and nomenclature system, comprising all 11 rotavirus gene segments, has prompted many investigators to start complete rotavirus genome sequencing projects.
19930627:32	Both reassortments between strains belonging to the same host species, and between strains belonging to different host species have been documented several times in the past [ - ].
19930627:33	The new classification system creates a necessary framework to thoroughly analyze possible interspecies transmissions of whole rotaviruses from one host to another, and to study the effect of reassortments on the generation of genetic rotavirus diversity, host range restriction, co-segregation of certain gene segments, and adaptation to a new host species . A Rotavirus Classification Work Group was setup to evaluate potentially new genotypes that will be discovered when more and more complete rotavirus genomes from multiple host species will be sequenced . The analyses of complete rotavirus genomes, and the assignment to the appropriate genotypes will be highly facilitated by the use of the free online RotaC-tool.
19930627:34	The RotaC-tool will be updated regularly, an will work closely together with the RCWG in order to update the tool with new genotypes, to reflect all established and new genotypes.
19930627:35	Conclusion 
There are several useful web-based tools and database resources for the genotyping analysis of viral sequences, based on phylogenetic trees, or sequence similarities of whole/partial sequences for the genotyping of HIV-1/HIV-2, HTLV-1/HTLV-2, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and poliovirus sequences [ - ].
19930627:36	Here we have introduced a reliable and easy-to-use automated classification tool for group A rotaviruses.
19930627:37	Our RotaC classification tool is in agreement with the rotavirus classification strategy and guidelines as proposed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.
19930627:38	The web-based RotaC tool can be freely accessed at .

20711351:0	Introduction 
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are highly sophisticated signal transduction machines able to respond to extracellular stimulus by activating diverse intracellular signaling pathways.
20711351:1	Recent research in this field is unveiling the complexity of the mechanisms involved, which are far from being understood in detail.
20711351:2	Among these mechanisms, allosteric modulation plays a central role in the fine-tuning of signaling.
20711351:3	Unfortunately, the experimental study of allosteric regulatory processes in GPCRs is difficult because contemporary techniques (X-ray crystallography – and FRET ) are unable to provide structural information of sufficient spatial resolution and time scales for describing specific atomic-level aspects of allosteric interactions.
20711351:4	In this scenario, computational methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can be used to provide unique insight into some elusive aspects of the problem, by meeting the aforementioned requirements in terms of both spatial resolution and time scale needed.
20711351:5	The present work describes the application of long (microsecond) MD simulations for exploring the effect of sodium ions in class A GPCRs and the mechanism involved in their role as allosteric modulators.
20711351:6	Dopaminergic receptors are GPCRs, belonging to the class A family, which have been used as drug targets for the treatment of diverse central nervous system disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease).
20711351:7	Allosteric modulation of dopaminergic GPCR by sodium ions has been extensively studied experimentally – and confirmed for the receptor subtypes in D 2 and D 4.
20711351:8	It has been proposed that sodium ions bind in an allosteric site (Asp2.50,
20711351:9	using residue numbering scheme of Ref.
20711351:10	) of the transmembrane (TM) region located below the orthosteric binding site.
20711351:11	The high conservation of Asp2.50 among GPCRs suggests its structural importance for the GPCR function.
20711351:12	Presumably, the negatively charged carboxylic group of Asp2.50 interacts via electrostatic interaction with the positively charged sodium ion.
20711351:13	Indeed, the introduction of uncharged residues in position 2.50 (Asp2.50Ala,
20711351:14	Asp2.50Asn) produces sodium insensitivity in D 2 and D 4 , demonstrating that the presence of a negative charge in the allosteric site is essential for maintaining sodium sensitivity.
20711351:15	Neve et al. proposed that the sodium binding site is a pyramidal hydrogen-bonding network formed by Asp2.50,
20711351:16	Ser3.39,
20711351:17	Asn7.45, and Ser7.46, with a sodium ion occupying the centre.
20711351:18	However, and in spite of the experimental information available, the molecular mechanism of the allosterically sodium-induced modulation on GPCR activation remains unknown.
20711351:19	In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of the sodium-induced effect, we have computationally investigated the mobility of sodium ions in the sodium-sensitive D 2 receptor.
20711351:20	All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the D 2 receptor were performed to analyze more than 6 µs of simulation data.
20711351:21	This analysis comprises a single 1.1 µs long simulation (MD1), one hundred 50 ns simulations (MD2) and biased metadynamics simulations (MD3) to compute accurate two-dimensional free energy profiles (see ).
20711351:22	The simulation of the sodium ion's trajectory into the D 2 receptor reveals a sodium ion entrance from the extracellular side of the receptor, which is followed by its threading into a pyramidal hydrogen-bonding network near the allosteric binding site (Asp2.50)
20711351:23	deep inside the receptor.
20711351:24	Most remarkably, the analysis of all these trajectories showed a correlation between the position of the sodium and the conformation of the Trp6.48 side chain.
20711351:25	This residue is part of the so called rotamer switch, a set of residues which are known to undergo major conformational change upon GPCR activation , . Kobilka and co-workers propose based on experimental data that the conformational state of the rotamer switch Trp6.48 is affected by ligands in the orthosteric binding site and is linked to a particular receptor response (agonists, partial agonists, neutral antagonist, inverse agonist) . Our study shows that, for dopaminergic receptors, the conformational state of the rotamer switch Trp6.48 can also be modulated from an allosteric site by sodium ions locking Trp6.48 in a conformational state identical to the partially inactive structure of the experimentally derived β 2 adrenergic receptor . 
Results/Discussion 
Recent advances in GPCR engineering and X-ray crystallography techniques has allowed the resolution of the structures of GPCRs closely-related phylogenetically to the D 2 receptor (PDB ID codes: 2RH1 and 3D4S, 2VT4, 3EML).
20711351:26	Superimposition of these templates shows larger structural deviations in the intra- and extracellular loop regions whereas high structural similarity is found in the TM region indicating that the topology of the TM region is highly conserved among aminergic GPCRs.
20711351:27	In our study, the high resolution X-ray structure of the β 2 adrenergic receptor (PDB entry 2RH1, resolution 2.40 Å) was selected as a template for the D 2 receptor modeling.
20711351:28	The TM region, which is the major focus of our study, has a sequence homology of about 42% (calculation based on the PAM 250 scoring matrix), which is above the suggested threshold of 30% acceptable for transmembrane models of membrane proteins .
20711351:29	The Asp2.50 residue has been modeled in a deprotonated form as indicated by the predicted protonation state of the carboxylic acid side chain of Asp2.50 for a pH value at 7.4 (for details see Supporting Information).
20711351:30	The predicted protonation state is in agreement with experimental studies which show that Asp2.50 is a putative sodium binding site with a deprotonated Asp2.50 side chain.
20711351:31	In order to allow a full structural relaxation of the obtained homology model, the D 2 receptor model is embedded in a realistic membrane bilayer environment (hydrated POPC, palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) and unconstrained MD simulations with the CHARMM forcefield are carried out under physiological ionic strength conditions.
20711351:32	The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of the D 2 receptor model over the course of a 1.1 µs molecular dynamics simulation (MD1) indicate that the structural relaxation of the receptor is reached after 190 ns.
20711351:33	Overall, the generated system proved to be very stable during more than 1 µs, with no major structural changes in the TM region of the D 2 receptor and larger structural rearrangements in the more flexible loop regions ( and see Figure 1 in ).
20711351:34	Assessment of the final D 2 receptor (snapshot at 1094 ns) relative to the initial D 2 receptor model and the experimental X-ray crystal structures using global pairwise 3D structural alignments of 191 C-alpha atoms of their corresponding TM regions demonstrates that the primary 7TM topology is well maintained during simulation (RMSD<2 Å in TM region, see Table 1 in ).
20711351:35	Consequently, the D 2 receptor model reflects a realistic ensemble of the helical arrangement, supporting the significance and physically realistic correctness of the generated system.
20711351:36	Moreover, this structural conservation of the TM region shows that the larger helical movement associated with GPCR signaling is not seen in 1.1 µs simulation time.
20711351:37	Methods 
For the realistic, three-dimensional structural molecular system, a D 2 homology model was built based on the β 2 adrenergic receptor (PDB ID 2RH1) according to a previously used protocol . The highly flexible N-terminal (sequence 1–29) and intracellular loop 3 (sequence 221–365) were omitted since no adequate template exists and because the putative binding site of sodium is located at Asp2.50 in the seven transmembrane region.
20711351:38	The D 2 receptor model was inserted into a hydrated and pre-equilibrated POPC lipid bilayer membrane (membrane builder tool of the VMD version1.8.6) . The initial system was equilibrated at 1 atm using the CHARMM force field with rigid bonds, time step 2 fs, cutoff 9 Å, PME grid size of 80×80×96, Langevin damping 0.1/ps.
20711351:39	After the initial equilibration phase, all the production runs were carried out using ACEMD at 300 K, in the NVT ensemble (damping factor 0.1/ps) to preserve the lipid cross section over long simulation times.
20711351:40	Molecular images were produced using VMD . Further details are provided in Supporting Information.
17496992:0	INTRODUCTION 
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare and heterogenous tumours that often require
combination therapy.
17496992:1	Despite multidisciplinary and multimodality
treatment, 10–20% of the tumours recur locally and distant
metastases develop in about 30% of
the patients . Various prognostic systems are in use,
most of which are based on combinations of tumour size, histologic
malignancy grade, necrosis, and vascular invasion [ , ].
17496992:2	Tumour size can be determined by preoperative imaging, whereas
preoperative assessment of the other factors will be based on the
limited biopsy material.
17496992:3	MRI is the imaging modality that is most
frequently used not only for preoperative evaluation of tumour
size but also for the mapping of the anatomical extension of STS
 . Prognostic factors that can be evaluated
preoperatively would be clinically valuable in order to identify
high-risk patients for neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
17496992:4	We have recently shown that STS with a
microscopically infiltrative growth pattern, as determined on
whole-tumour sections, have a considerably higher risk (HR 4.6)
for both local recurrence and metastasis compared to STS with a
pushing growth pattern . The prognostic strength of
infiltrative growth was similar to or stronger than that of other
commonly used prognostic factors.
17496992:5	The possibility to identify
infiltrative growth of STS on MRI has, to our knowledge, not yet
been assessed and we therefore aimed to evaluate the peripheral
tumour growth pattern on preoperative MRI sequences and correlated
these findings to the microscopical characteristics on
whole-tumour sections and to outcome in 78 patients with STS of
the extremities and the trunk wall.
17496992:6	PATIENTS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
All 22 tumours with a pushing growth pattern on
histopathology were classified as pushing or focally
infiltrative on MRI. 4 of these tumours developed metastasis and
none recurred locally.
17496992:7	Among the 56 microscopically infiltrative
tumours, MRI identified 37 as pushing or focally infiltrative, and
19 as diffusely infiltrative.
17496992:8	The MRI-based
growth pattern showed no obvious association with tumour size,
depth, or grade; indeed a pushing growth
pattern was identified in 2/3 of the large (> 5 cm) tumours
and in 1/3 of the grade IV tumours.
17496992:9	Metastases developed in 12 of the 19 (rate 0.6)
diffusely infiltrative tumours compared to 21/59 (rate 0.4) in the
tumours with a pushing or focally infiltrative growth pattern on
MRI ( P = .03).
17496992:10	The former group had an HR of 2.5 for the risk of
development of metastases (95% CI = 1.2–5.1; P = .01)
( ).
17496992:11	Local tumour recurrences developed in 6/19
(rate 0.3) diffusely infiltrative tumours compared to 7/59 (rate
0.1) tumours with a pushing or focally infiltrative growth pattern
on MRI ( P = .04).
17496992:12	In the analysis of local recurrence free
survival, infiltrative growth on MRI showed an HR of 3.7 (95% CI
= 1.2–11; P = .02).
17496992:13	DISCUSSION 
MRI have become part of the standard procedure for the
preoperative evaluation of STS because of high-resolution mapping
of the anatomical extension of the tumour.
17496992:14	Dynamic,
contrast-enhanced MRI has been suggested to differentiate viable
from nonviable (necrotic or avascular) tumour areas, and could
therefore potentially be valuable for preoperative prognostication
.
17496992:15	The overall, prognostic value of preoperative MRI,
however, is largely unknown.
17496992:16	We have in a recent study
demonstrated that the microscopical peripheral tumour growth
pattern (pushing versus infiltrative) determined on whole-tumour
sections provides new and independent prognostic information in
STS; tumours with infiltrative growth have an increased risk for
local recurrences as well as for metastases . We did not
analyse the relation between MRI findings and prognostic factors
such as tumour size and histologic malignancy grade since our aim
was to assess whether growth pattern on MRI could be used for
prognosis rather than to assess a value of combining MRI findings
with other factors in a prognostic system for soft tissue sarcoma.
17496992:17	In the current study we found that tumours with
diffuse infiltrative growth on MRI had a worse prognosis, both
with regards to local recurrence and metastasis, whereas tumours
with a pushing or focally infiltrative growth pattern on MRI had a
better prognosis.
17496992:18	In the latter groups MRI was less accurate;
almost one third of the histopathologically pushing tumours had
focal infiltration on MRI and one third of the histopathologically
infiltrative tumours had pushing growth on MRI.
17496992:19	In our previous
study  (see Material and Methods) we found that the
percentage of the tumour rim that was histopathologically
infiltrative was of no prognostic importance; tumours were divided
into pushing tumours, with no infiltration anywhere, versus all
others.
17496992:20	In the current study we found the inverse; only diffuse
infiltration on MRI was of prognostic importance.
17496992:21	Difficulties in
determining infiltration on MRI probably account for this
difference; the diffusely infiltrating tumours (with infiltration
around the entire tumour rim) are more likely to identify
infiltrative growth as determined histopathologically, whereas
focal infiltration on MRI may be false positive.
17496992:22	We recognize several weaknesses in our study, namely,
retrospective analysis and nonstandardized MRI examinations.
17496992:23	The
resolution was suboptimal in several cases, which may reflect
nonstandardization as well as MRI having a lower resolution than
microscopic examination and this may explain why infiltration was
not identified in many tumours and classified as focally
infiltrative in many tumours with a pushing growth on
histopathology.
17496992:24	However, our finding of a poor prognosis for
tumours with diffuse infiltration on MRI suggests that MRI should
in a standardized way classify the peripheral tumour growth
pattern.
17496992:25	We therefore suggest that our findings should be tested
in a prospective study using high-resolution MRI in order to
improve the preoperative risk assessment in patients with STS.
21609489:0	Background 
Until recently, strategies for improvement of many global food legume species have been hindered by a lack of genetic and genomic resources.
21609489:1	During the early 1990s, barrel medic ( Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) and Lotus japonicus L. were selected as candidate model legume species, due to relatively small genome sizes, inbreeding reproductive habits and short life-cycles . Whole genome sequencing projects have been undertaken for these species, providing the opportunity to identify putative orthologous gene sequence resources in other crop legume species, especially those located within the Galegoid clade of the Fabaceae sub-family Papilionoideae . In addition, a draft genome sequence has been completed for the warm-season food legume, soybean ( Glycine max ), which is located in the other major (Phaseoloid) clade providing additional further insights into comparative genomics within the Fabaceae family.
21609489:2	The current dearth of genomic resources for many crop legume species prohibits effective exploitation, through comparative or translational studies, of molecular genetic tools generated from the three genome draft sequences.
21609489:3	There is consequently a pressing need for significant efforts to either develop markers capable of cross-species transfer, in order to enrich existing genetic maps, or generate more informative species-specific genetic and genomic tools which can enable the identification of orthologous genes through genome synteny analysis . 
Lentil ( Lens culinaris ssp.
21609489:4	culinaris ) is an important grain legume species cultivated throughout Western Asia, the Middle east, North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, North America and Australia, providing a vital source of dietary protein in human diets and straw for animal feed.
21609489:5	Lentil is a diploid (2n = 2 × = 14), annual flowering self-pollinating crop with a genome size of c. 4 Gbp . Lentil shares the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen with other legumes, making it important in the management of soil fertility in cereal based cropping systems.
21609489:6	Lentil also provides rotational benefits for management of weeds, diseases and pests, and in many cases offers a profitable, high value crop option for farmers .
21609489:7	However, relatively few genomic resources are currently available for lentil, a total of 9,513 EST sequences being present in the public domain as of 3 rd February 2011.
21609489:8	Estimation of elapsed times since species divergence from a common ancestor is important for plant comparative genomics.
21609489:9	The Galegoid sub-family Vicieae, which contains M. truncatula lentil, field pea ( Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean ( Vicia faba L.), diverged from the Loteae sub-family (which contains Lotus japonicus ) c.
21609489:10	25 million years ago . Despite this extended period of divergence, high levels of macrosynteny are observed between the various Galegoid species . Close genomic relationships have also been observed for more distant comparisons, such as between Glycine and Medicago , for which substantial regions of almost perfect colinearity have been observed.
21609489:11	Comparative sequence studies with genome-sequenced legumes is hence of potentially high value for underdeveloped species such as lentil.
21609489:12	Due to recent advances in sequencing technology it has become possible to rapidly generate large datasets with significantly reduced time and labour requirements . These methods offer a cost-effective means to access the gene space of a target organism through in-depth sequencing of the transcriptome.
21609489:13	Initial transcriptome sequencing studies were largely exploratory, and failed to exploit the potential for next-generation transcriptome sequencing at different scales .
21609489:14	However, many recent reports have been published on massively parallel approaches to transcriptome sequencing [ - ], largely using model organisms with available draft genomes to assist assembly . Nonetheless, successful studies have also been performed to generate de novo transcriptome data assemblies for organisms with no prior genomic resource development . 
Given that large numbers of plant species are candidates for DNA sequencing, and that technology resources are currently finite, careful decisions are required in respect of sequencing strategy , especially for species such as lentil which possess large nuclear genomes.
21609489:15	ESTs are single-pass, partial sequences from cDNA clones that provide a rapid and cost-effective method to analyse transcribed portions of the genome, while avoiding the non-coding and repetitive DNA components which contribute the majority of nuclear DNA content in species with large genomes.
21609489:16	EST sequencing has proved useful in accelerated gene discovery, including identification of gene family structure, expression analysis, determination of phylogenetic relationships, development of molecular markers such as SSRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) .
21609489:17	Among the different varieties of molecular genetic markers, SSRs have many advantages including high prevalence and ubiquitous distribution within genomes, co-dominant multi-allelic nature and high reproducibility of assay conditions . Functionally-associated EST-SSRs provide an effective means of molecular marker development that targets nucleotide diversity in genic regions, allowing the possibility of 'perfect' marker development for the molecular breeding of crop plants.
21609489:18	In addition, due to location in conserved genic regions, EST-SSR markers frequently display a high degree of operational transferability between related species .
21609489:19	This study describes the generation, de novo assembly and annotation of a transcriptome-derived EST dataset derived from cDNA obtained from multiple tissues of six genotypes of lentil at various stages of development, using the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX Titanium second-generation DNA sequencing technology.
21609489:20	Clustering and annotation to generate a unigene set has permitted computational identification of SSR loci, and the design and evaluation of a set of EST-SSR marker-directed primer pairs.

21385377:0	Background 
Conifer trees (order Coniferales ; Gymnosperms) are extremely long-lived plants that must confront a multitude of biotic and abiotic stresses that vary with the season and over their lifetime.
21385377:1	Conifers have evolved several resistance mechanisms that repel, kill, inhibit, or otherwise reduce the success of herbivores and pathogens.
21385377:2	These mechanisms include both mechanical and chemical defences that can be present constitutively or that are induced upon challenge . As a major part of their constitutive and inducible defensive repertoire, conifers produce an abundant and complex mixture of terpenoids in the form of oleoresin secretions and volatile emissions . The diversity of the terpenoids in conifers suggests that, like in other plants , an arms race has unfolded in the interactions of conifers with other organisms through the production of specialized (i.e., secondary) metabolites.
21385377:3	The diversity of conifer terpenoids includes predominantly monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, which originate from the activity of a family of terpene synthases (TPSs), and other enzymes, such as cytochromes P450, that may functionalize some of the terpenes . 
Despite much work on individual conifer TPSs , the total number of TPSs present in any one conifer species is not yet known since no conifer genome has been sequenced to date.
21385377:4	In contrast, the sequenced and annotated genomes of several angiosperm species provide an indication of the diversity of TPSs we might expect to see in any one plant species.
21385377:5	For example, the genes encoding putatively active mono-, sesqui-, and di-TPSs number at least 32 in the Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) genome , at least 31 in the rice ( Oryza sativa ) genome , at least 32 in the poplar ( Populus trichocarpa ) genome , and at least 69 in the genome of a highly inbred grapevine ( Vitis vinifera ) Pinot Noir variety . All of these angiosperm genomes contain clusters of duplicated TPS genes.
21385377:6	The large genome size of conifers and the diversity of their terpenoid profiles may suggest a similarly sized or potentially larger TPS gene family in conifer species.
21385377:7	However, targeted BAC sequencing of a few conifer TPSs from white spruce ( Picea glauca ) did not reveal any genomic clustering of multiple TPS genes in this conifer genome . 
Most of our current knowledge of the size, functional diversity and phylogeny of gymnosperm TPSs is based on targeted cDNA cloning and characterization in two conifer species, grand fir ( Abies grandis ) and Norway spruce ( P. abies ), along with a few TPSs in other gymnosperms . In grand fir, 11 different TPS genes have been functionally characterized . Martin et al.  described a set of 9 different TPSs in Norway spruce ( P. abies ) and examined the phylogeny of 29 gymnosperm TPSs, all of which fell into the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily.
21385377:8	A deeper understanding of the diversity and functional complexity of the conifer TPS-d subfamily requires additional gene discovery by transcriptome mining.
21385377:9	Large collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) exist for several conifer species [ - ] and provide a rich resource for identifying and functionally characterizing new TPSs.
21385377:10	Here, we have analyzed the ESTs and FLcDNAs from Sitka spruce ( P. sitchensis ), white spruce ( P. glauca ), and hybrid white spruce ( P. glauca × P. engelmannii ) to identify a comprehensive set of expressed members of the spruce TPS gene family.
21385377:11	We have functionally characterized several members from each species for a total of 21 newly characterized spruce TPSs.
21385377:12	This work complements previous work in Norway spruce  and provides a molecular basis from which to explain much of the chemical complexity of the oleoresin and volatile terpenoids in spruce.
21385377:13	Results of the functional gene characterization are discussed in the context of previously reported terpenoid metabolite profiles of oleoresin and volatile emissions in Sitka spruce.
21385377:14	Results and Discussion 
Conclusions 
Based upon estimates from EST and FLcDNA sequencing in three species of spruce, the TPS gene family in conifers appears to be at least of comparable size to those found in angiosperms with sequenced genomes.
21385377:15	This study highlights the great diversity of TPSs of specialized metabolism in conifers, which resulted from gene duplication and functional diversification.
21385377:16	Functional differences can occur naturally due to small differences in amino acid sequence.

Not all devices that measure the same property do it in the same way—a clock might use a spring system or it might be digitally synchronized to a transmitted signal
null:1	Although both have the same goal of reporting accurate time, each is subject to different errors.
null:2	Sometimes even the same device uses different systems to measure the same property.
null:3	A relatively simple device like a camera will use one sensor system to capture light intensity for an image and a second sensor to capture light intensity for making automatic adjustments of aperture and flash.
null:4	It does not seem outlandish, therefore, that the brain might also have developed multiple sensory systems to achieve different goals.
null:5	Indeed, an influential hypothesis has argued that people use two separate visual processing systems in much the same way as a camera—one for creating our perception of the world and another for guiding our actions within it.
null:6	One line of evidence supporting this dual hypothesis comes from an illusion known as Roelofs effect.
null:7	Usually, people are pretty good at judging the location of even a small object.
null:8	But if the small object is surrounded by a large frame and the frame itself is not centered in front of the person who is judging it, the viewer will perceive the object as shifted in a direction opposite that of the frame.
null:9	This may not in itself be surprising, but the same person who perceives an offset of the object where none exists is nonetheless able to grasp it without difficulties.
null:10	In this issue of PLoS Biology Paul Dassonville and his colleagues reexamine the seeming dissociation of visual analysis for perception and action, and call it into question.
null:11	Through a careful quantitative analysis of the conditions under which the Roelofs effect occurs, they find that it traces not to an illusory perception of the object location but to an illusory perception of self.
null:12	The large frame, presented under experimental conditions in which subjects sit in darkness without access to a normal rich sensory environment, actually causes people to incorrectly perceive their own centers as rotated towards the frame and therefore to conclude that the small object is offset with respect to themselves.
null:13	This may seem like a subtle distinction, and yet, since it is the observer's frame of reference that is altered, that same distorted frame of reference will be used to guide movement.
null:14	Thus, the error in movement planning should cancel the error in perception, and people should have no trouble reaching for the object despite their misperception, which is indeed what is observed.
null:15	Others have questioned the hypothesis that two separable neural systems process the visual world for perception and action, but this study removes one of the strongest pieces of evidence in its favor with a precise alternative explanation.
null:16	No two brains may see the world identically, but the authors suggest that it may be time to concede that a single brain, at least, has the same world view.
21408159:0	Introduction 
Healthy longevity is a complex phenotype determined by a mix of genetic and environmental factors.
21408159:1	The heritable component of human longevity is estimated to be modest (25–30%) .
21408159:2	This genetic advantage in lifespan is not explained by common disease alleles suggesting the existence of specific longevity promoting mechanisms.
21408159:3	In humans, little is known about the mechanisms driving familial longevity.
21408159:4	Data from various model organisms suggest that longevity is promoted by alterations in insulin signaling, metabolism and increased resistance to oxidative stress.
21408159:5	Recent studies have demonstrated that growth hormone, thyroid hormone and insulin may play an important role in the control of the key proteins that regulate maintenance of homocysteine homeostasis.
21408159:6	For example, Ames Dwarf mice, which lack the pituitary hormones growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone and show extended lifespan compared to their wild-type counterparts, were found to exhibit upregulated transsulfuration and low homocysteine levels, which might be linked to enhanced cellular oxidative stress defense mechanisms . 
In humans, data regarding methionine metabolism and longevity are sparse.
21408159:7	Increased concentrations of homocysteine have consistently been associated with ischemic cardiac events, stroke, venous thrombosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis and depression – . In line with these associations, higher levels of homocysteine have shown to independently predict all cause mortality in large population cohorts , as well as in clinical populations . Particularly, in the oldest old homocysteine has shown to be a better predictor for all cause and cardiovascular mortality than the commonly used Framingham risk score . While the association between homocysteine and disease is well established in the general population, it is unclear whether familial longevity is also characterised by altered homocysteine levels.
21408159:8	We investigated whether lower levels of homocysteine at middle age mark familial longevity.
21408159:9	In the Leiden Longevity Study, we have previously shown that the offspring from long-lived nonagenarian sibling have, at middle age, a lower mortality rate compared to the normal population, and have a healthier metabolic profile and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease compared to their partners with whom they share their environment . 
Materials and Methods 
Results 
Baseline characteristics of participants are shown in .
21408159:10	At baseline, offspring were slightly older, had a lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and a tendency towards lower prevalence of myocardial infarction compared to controls.
21408159:11	Creatinine levels tended to be lower in offspring (p = 0.076),
21408159:12	whereas folic acid and vitamine B12 did not differ between groups.
21408159:13	The common C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene was equally distributed between groups.
21408159:14	Allele frequency in our cohort was comparable to earlier reports in the Dutch population and genotype distribution was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.
21408159:15	First, we tested whether homocysteine concentrations were related to well known determinants.
21408159:16	Mean homocysteine concentration was 12.5 µmol/L (standard deviation (SD) 2.9 µmol/L).
21408159:17	Mean homocysteine concentrations were 11.8 µmol/L (standard error (SE) 0.09 µmol/L) for females, and 13.3 µmol/L (SE 0.09 µmol/L) for males (p-value for difference<0.001).
21408159:18	Homocysteine concentrations also related to calendar age, with a mean increase of 0.06 µmol/L (SE 0.01 µmol/L) per year for women (p<0.001), and 0.07 µmol/L (S.E.0.01) per year increase in tHcy for men (p<0.001).
21408159:19	Furthermore, homocysteine concentrations were positively correlated with creatinine levels (p<0.001), folic acid (p<0.001), vitamin B12 levels (p<0.001), and genotype of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism (p<0.001).
21408159:20	We then tested whether homocysteine concentrations were related to prevalence of disease history.
21408159:21	shows that homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher when history of stroke or hypertension was present.
21408159:22	Finally, we tested whether differences existed in homocysteine concentrations between offspring and controls.
21408159:23	shows the differences between offspring and partner, both crude and after adjustment for age, sex and creatinine.
21408159:24	No differences were found in homocysteine concentrations between offspring and partners (12.7 (SE 0.1) vs. 12.7 (SE 0.1) µmol/L).
21408159:25	Furthermore, no differences in distribution of homocysteine were found between groups, showing the lack of difference of homocysteine between groups across the entire range of values.
21408159:26	Also, no differences were found when stratifying for males and females separately.
21408159:27	Additionally, no differences were found in the age-related rise in homocysteine between offspring and controls (p for interaction 0.63).
21408159:28	In the total study population, 21 subjects had prescriptions for folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation.
21408159:29	Excluding these subjects from analysis did not influence outcomes.
21408159:30	To assess the effect of outlying high homocysteine values, we repeated the analysis excluding 18 subjects with homocysteine concentrations higher than the 99 th percentile (25.78 µmol/L), which did not materially change results (data not shown).
21408159:31	Discussion 
In the present study we aimed to find a relationship between familial longevity and homocysteine concentrations.
21408159:32	We found that homocysteine was associated with classical determinants, but did not differ between individuals from long-lived families compared to their environmentally matched partners, nor did age-related increase in homocysteine concentrations.
21408159:33	We found a positive association between plasma homocysteine concentrations with cardiovascular disease prevalence, and with classical determinants of homocysteine such as age, sex, creatinine, vitamin B12 and folate, and MTHFR genotype.
21408159:34	These findings implicate that homocysteine measurements were valid and show associations that are in agreement with previous reports – . 
Unlike earlier observations of difference in glucose, lipid and thyroid metabolism , , we found no association of levels of homocysteine with familial longevity at middle age in our study population.
21408159:35	This finding is in line with the recent debate on the causality of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease.
21408159:36	Although homocysteine has consistently shown to predict cardiovascular disease in prospective studies, recent meta-analyses and reviews of the homocysteine-lowering trials showed no effect on cardiovascular end points of homocysteine lowering by means of folate and vitamin B in individuals with prior cardiovascular disease .
21408159:37	However, controversy on the implications of these findings for the causal role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease remain, for instance because potential adverse side effects of folate and B vitamins on atherosclerosis might undo the beneficial effects of lowering homocysteine .
21408159:38	It has been proposed that homocysteine is a marker or read-out of vascular damage and that homocysteine per se is not causally involved in the etiology of cardiovascular disease and mortality.
21408159:39	The data presented in the present study support this theory.
21408159:40	Despite the lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors in our cohort of individuals from long-lived families, we did not find homocysteine concentrations to be lower in middle-aged subjects enriched for longevity.
21408159:41	Genetic studies of MTHFR polymorphisms, a genetic determinant of homocysteine concentrations, have shown a relationship between MTHFR genotype and coronary heart disease although substantial heterogeneity between the results of published studies reflected selective publication or other methodological problems.
21408159:42	These findings further fuel the debate on the causal role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease.
21408159:43	In the present study we used the association of MTHFR genotypes with homocysteine concentrations in this study as positive control, to show that homocysteine concentrations showed expected associations and is therefore a valid measurement.
21408159:44	Notably, we did not perform a formal Mendelian Randomization analysis in our family based approach as we have selected groups based on phenotypic differences, namely longevity.
21408159:45	Furthermore, the study was underpowered to perform such an analysis.
21408159:46	We do therefore not make a claim on causal relationships (or absence thereof) based on this genetic association.
21408159:47	Taken together we conclude that levels of homocysteine do not predict familial longevity.
21408159:48	A drawback of our study is that we did not measure other metabolites of the methionine cycle such as methionine, cysteine and glutathione and did therefore not fully cover the methionine metabolism.
21408159:49	Glutathione, the end point of the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine, could be of interest as it is an important intra-cellular antioxidant and is related to aging and disease in humans and longevity in various animal models – .
21408159:50	Other interesting metabolites in the methionine cycle include S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), as their ratio is a representation of methylation status, and both markers have been associated with cardiovascular abnormalities more strongly than homocysteine itself – . For that reason, we cannot exclude that other differences in methionine metabolism might be related to familial longevity.
21408159:51	Still, given the lack of difference in homocysteine concentrations, which represent a central marker of methionine metabolism, we consider the possibility of finding major differences in other metabolites to be small.
21408159:52	The Leiden Longevity Study is unique in that it allows studying us to study longevity-related factors already at middle-age.
21408159:53	To our knowledge, our study is the first to address homocysteine in relation to familial longevity.
21408159:54	In conclusion, the results suggest that homocysteine metabolism is not likely to predict familial longevity.
17908304:0	Background 
Gastric cancer is the second most frequent malignancy worldwide and the prognosis of this malignancy remains very poor . Gastric cancer incidence and mortality rates differ between different countries within the European Union . In the Netherlands it ranks fifth as a cause of cancer death, with approximately 2,200 new cases each year . Surgery with curative intent is the treatment of choice in advanced cases of gastric cancer, whereas local endoscopic mucosectomy can be curative in early gastric cancer.
17908304:1	Detection and removal of gastric neoplasias in an early or even premalignant state will contribute to reduce death due to gastric cancer.
17908304:2	To achieve this goal, better tests for early detection of gastric cancer are needed, and an improved understanding of the biology of gastric cancer progression is crucial in this respect.
17908304:3	According to the Correa model, pathogenesis of intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma follows a pathway of chronic active gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori infection, leading to mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia followed by intraepithelial neoplasia and finally invasive adenocarcinoma . Genetic characterization of tissue samples in intraepithelial neoplasia stage would substantially contribute to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
17908304:4	However, these lesions are only rarely detected, possibly due to rapid progression through this stage towards cancer, and are usually present only in parts of biopsy specimens, hampering genomic analysis of these lesions.
17908304:5	Analysis of alternative precursor lesions could therefore, at least partly, be a substitute.
17908304:6	Development of gastric cancer through an adenoma stage, although less common, is such alternative route.
17908304:7	These adenomas are occasionally detected during gastroscopy and present as large lesions that histologically show intra-epithelial neoplasia, which makes them suitable for genomic analysis.
17908304:8	Gastric adenomas have a direct malignant potential and account for approximately 20% of all epithelial polyps . Gastric adenomas can have a classic tubular, tubulovillous, or villous morphology with a predominantly intestinal-type epithelium, but can also appear as pyloric gland adenomas . Pyloric gland adenomas arise from deep mucoid glands in the stomach and are strongly positive for mucin 6 . A substantial number of gastric adenomas already show progression to adenocarcinoma.
17908304:9	On first diagnosis around 30–40% of all pyloric gland adenomas already show a focus of carcinoma . For intestinal-type adenomas this number is lower and varies from 28,5% for villous adenomas and 29.4% for tubulovillous type adenomas to only 5.4% in the tubular adenomas . Both adenocarcinomas, ex intestinal-type adenomas and ex pyloric gland adenomas, show glandular structures, in contrast to diffuse type gastric cancer.
17908304:10	A key feature in the pathogenesis of most gastric cancers, as in many other solid cancers, is chromosomal instability, resulting in gains and losses of parts or even whole chromosomes . These chromosomal changes can be analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).
17908304:11	Several previous studies have detected genetic alterations in gastric adenomas using this technique, being gains on chromosome 7q, 8q, 13q, 20q, and losses on chromosome 4p, 5q, 9p 17p and 18q [ - ].
17908304:12	Although uncommon and only observed in adenomas with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high level amplifications have been detected on chromosomes 7q, 8p, 13q, 17q and 20q [ - ].
17908304:13	In gastric adenocarcinomas, consistently described chromosomal aberrations are gains on chromosome 3q, 7p, 7q, 8q, 13q, 17q and 20q and losses on chromosome 4q, 5q, 6q, 9p, 17p and 18q.
17908304:14	High level amplifications have been repeatedly detected on 7q, 8p, 8q, 17q, 19q and 20q [ - ].
17908304:15	Yet, chromosomal aberrations, or DNA copy number changes, are not uniform in gastric cancer . Subgroups with different patterns of DNA copy number alterations can be recognized, which have been shown to be associated with clinical outcome as well . 
In the present study, we set out to study whether two morphologically distinct categories of gastric cancer precursor lesions, i.e. intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas, would carry different patterns of DNA copy number changes, possibly reflecting distinct genetic pathways of gastric carcinogenesis in the two adenoma types.
17908304:16	Results 
DNA copy number changes were observed in 10 out of 11 intestinal-type adenomas and 9 out of 10 pyloric gland adenomas.
17908304:17	The mean number of chromosomal events, defined as gains and losses, per tumour was 6.0 (range 0–18), including 2.9 (range 0–14) gains and 3.0 (range 0–7) losses.
17908304:18	In intestinal-type adenomas, the mean number of chromosomal events per tumour was 6.5 (range 0–18) of which 3.4 (range 0–14) gains and 3.1 (range 0–7) losses, and in the pyloric gland adenomas the mean numbers were 5.4 (range 0–9), 2.4 (range 0–7) and 3.0 (range 0–7) respectively.
17908304:19	In the intestinal-type gastric adenomas, the most common aberrations observed were gains on chromosomes 8, 9q and 11q, and losses on chromosomes 5q, 6, 10 and 13.
17908304:20	In four adenomas (36.4%), gain of chromosome 11q23.3 was observed with a common region of overlap of 2.6 Mb.
17908304:21	Gain of chromosome 9q was observed in four adenomas (36.4%) with a 12.6 Mb common region of overlap located on chromosome 9q33.1-q34.13.
17908304:22	Gain of chromosome 8 was observed in three adenomas (31%), two of which adenomas showed gain of whole chromosome 8, and the third adenoma showed a gain of chromosome 8p-q22.3 with an additional 28.7 Mb gain on chromosome 8q24.11-qter.
17908304:23	In addition, gains were observed on chromosomes 1, 3, 6p, 7, 11p, 12p, 13q, 16, 17, 19, 20 and 22q.
17908304:24	No amplifications were seen in the intestinal-type adenomas.
17908304:25	Deletions on chromosome 13 were observed in seven intestinal-type adenomas (64%).
17908304:26	Of these, five showed a 11.9 Mb deletion of chromosome 13q21.2-21.33 with an additional 7.7 Mb deletion on chromosome 13q31.1-31.3.
17908304:27	The other two adenomas showed a 16.6 Mb deletion of 13q14.3-31.
17908304:28	A deletion on chromosome 6 was observed in six adenomas (55%), with an overlapping region of 68.9 Mb located on 6cen-q22.1.
17908304:29	A deletion of chromosome 5q was observed in four adenomas (36%) with a common region of overlap located on chromosome 5q22.1-q23.2.
17908304:30	In addition, a deletion of whole chromosome 10 was observed in four adenomas (36%).
17908304:31	Other losses observed in intestinal-type adenomas were located on chromosomes 8q, 9p, 10, 12q, 20q and 21.
17908304:32	An overview of all DNA copy number aberrations of the intestinal-type adenomas is shown in Table . 
The most frequent aberration observed in pyloric gland adenomas were gains on chromosome 20 and losses on chromosomes 5q and 6.
17908304:33	Gains on chromosome 20 were seen in four adenomas (40%).
17908304:34	Three adenomas showed a 9.8 Mb gain of chromosome 20q13.12-q13.33, and gain of whole chromosome 20 was observed in the other adenoma.
17908304:35	In addition, gains were seen on chromosomes 1, 3q, 5q, 7, 9q, 11q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 17 and 22q.
17908304:36	One pyloric gland adenoma showed amplifications, located on 12q13.2-q21.1 and 20q13.3-q13.33.
17908304:37	Five pyloric gland adenomas (50%) showed loss of chromosome 5q, two of which had lost a whole chromosome arm, while two adenomas showed a 22.4 Mb deletion of 5q11.2-q13.3 and one adenoma a 40.3 Mb deletion of 5q21.1-q31.2.
17908304:38	Loss of chromosome 6 was observed in four pyloric gland adenomas (40%), three of which showed a complete loss of 6q and one adenoma showed a 51.2 Mb deletion of 6p21.1-q16.3.
17908304:39	Other chromosomal losses were observed on chromosomes 1p, 2q, 4, 9p, 10, 12q 13q, 14q, 16, 18q, 20q, and 21.
17908304:40	An overview of DNA copy number aberrations of the pyloric gland adenomas is shown in Table . 
The most common aberrations shared by both intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas were gain of chromosome 9q (29%), 11q (29%), and 20q (33%) and loss of chromosome 5 (43%), 6 (48%), 10 (33%) and 13q (48%).
17908304:41	By comparing intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas, CGH Multiarray revealed eight clones to be significantly different, six of which were located at chromosome 6q14-q21 (p = 0.02 to 0.05) and two clones on chromosome 9p22-p23 (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) (Figure ).
17908304:42	No genes located in the regions covered by these clones have been known to be involved in cancer related biological processes.
17908304:43	Yet, CGH Multiarray Region, after correction for multiplicity, yielded a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 for all these regions, indicating no significant differences between the two different types of adenomas at the chromosomal level.
17908304:44	Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis yielded 2 clusters.
17908304:45	No significant associations were found here (p = 0.8).
17908304:46	Discussion 
Given the heterogeneous phenotype of gastric cancer, the present study primarily aimed to compare copy number changes between intestinal-type adenomas and pyloric gland adenomas, in order to find leads towards genetic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
17908304:47	Adenoma-to-carcinoma progression is observed in 30–40% of the pyloric gland adenomas and in approximately 5–30% of the intestinal-type adenomas (varying from about 5% in tubular adenomas to almost 30% for tubulovillous and villous adenomas) [ - ], indicating the direct malignant potential of these two adenoma types and making gastric adenomas a suitable model for detecting early events in gastric carcinogenesis.
17908304:48	Pyloric gland adenomas constitute a recently recognized entity . To the best of our knowledge, this type of adenomas has never been analyzed by array CGH before.
17908304:49	The mean number of events in this type of adenoma was 5.4 (0–9), with 2.4 (0–7) gains and 3 (0–7) losses.
17908304:50	This is comparable with the mean number of aberrations in intestinal-type adenomas (6.5 (0–18), 3.4 (0–14) and 3.1 (0–7) respectively).
17908304:51	In pyloric gland adenomas, frequent events were gain on chromosome 20 and losses on chromosomes 5q and 6, while intestinal-type adenomas mainly showed gain on chromosomes 8, 9q, and 11q, and losses on chromosomes 5q, 6, 10 and 13.
17908304:52	In the present study, gain of chromosome 7 was less common than found previously .
17908304:53	Although these frequently altered regions differ between the two types of adenomas, hierarchical cluster analyses did not separate the groups.
17908304:54	In addition, CGH Multiarray Region did not reveal any significant differences after correction for multiple comparisons.
17908304:55	This lack of statistically significant differences could be due to the limited sample size combined with the fact that in general, adenomas show little chromosomal aberrations.
17908304:56	On the other hand, it could simply be that these morphologically different entities do not differ in terms of chromosomal gains and losses.
17908304:57	Finding no significant differences at the chromosomal level does not preclude other genetic and biological differences such as mutation or promoter methylation status of specific genes.
17908304:58	Aberrations already detected in adenomas may be early events in the stepwise process of accumulating changes which may cause progression of adenoma to carcinoma.
17908304:59	As expected, the mean number of chromosomal events was lower in adenomas compared to the carcinomas [ , ].
17908304:60	Moreover, high level amplifications are uncommon in adenomas, while carcinomas frequently show high level amplifications . 
The aberrations found in both intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas, such as losses on chromosome 5q, are also frequently detected in gastric carcinomas [ , ].
17908304:61	Previous CGH results showed a significantly higher number of chromosome 5q losses in intestinal-type carcinoma compared to diffuse type carcinoma . Chromosome 6, also lost in both types of adenomas, frequently is deleted in gastric carcinomas as determined by LOH studies . Moreover, chromosome 6q deletion has been reported to be involved in an early stage of gastric carcinogenesis, since chromosome 6q deletions are frequently detected in early gastric cancer and also in intestinal metaplasia . Losses of chromosomes 10 and 13 have been previously observed in adenomas at lower frequencies.
17908304:62	In gastric carcinomas, both gains and losses of chromosome 10 and 13 have been observed by previous CGH studies [ , ].
17908304:63	Chromosome 10 harbors the oncogene FGFR2 (10q26) and tumour suppressor genes PTEN/MMAC1 (10q23) and DMBT1 (10q25-q26), both involved in carcinogenesis, which could explain the observation of both gains and losses of chromosomes 10 in gastric carcinomas [ - ].
17908304:64	Indeed chromosome 13 harbors tumour suppressor genes such as BRCA2 (13q12.3) and retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) (13q14).
17908304:65	In contrast, gain of chromosome 13q has been correlated to colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression, and amplification of chromosome 13 has been observed in gastric adenomas with severe intraepithelial neoplasia .
17908304:66	The precise role of chromosome 13 aberration in gastric cancer therefore remains to be resolved.
17908304:67	Most frequent copy number gains were observed on chromosomes 8, 9q, 11q and 20.
17908304:68	Especially gains of chromosomes 8 and 20 are consistent with previous (array) CGH studies in both gastric adenomas and gastric carcinomas [ - , ], implicating this as early events in tumourigenesis.
17908304:69	Although gain of chromosome 11q has not been described as a frequent event in adenomas, in carcinomas gain or amplification on chromosome 11q is common [ - ].
17908304:70	In the present study gain of chromosome 11q was frequently observed in the adenomas, implying the malignant potential of these adenomas.
17908304:71	Conclusion 
These data indicate that gains on chromosomes 8, 9q, 11q and 20 and losses on chromosomes 5q, 6, 10 and 13 are early events in gastric carcinogenesis.
17908304:72	Despite the phenotypical differences, intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenoma do not differ significantly at the level of DNA copy number changes.

20052465:0	Introduction 
The sensitive and accurate detection of vaccine-specific T cells is a fundamental requirement for use of T cell monitoring assays to facilitate the development of immunotherapeutics within clinical trials  . The CIMT Immunoguiding Program (CIP) is one of a number of recent international initiatives that is committed to quality assurance and harmonization of the most commonly used techniques for cellular immunomonitoring, such as staining with HLA-peptide multimers, flow cytometric determination of intracellular cytokines and the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay  . Through a series of proficiency testing panels, critical variables in assay protocols have been identified and corrected, resulting in assay harmonization  . In addition, the panels provide the opportunity of external validation for the participating laboratories.
20052465:1	Here we report on the analysis of the influence of serum supplement to ELISPOT test media across different protocols.
20052465:2	Many laboratories use either human or fetal calf serum in their ELISPOT test medium to maintain the viability and function of T cells.
20052465:3	However, serum batches are known to have unique compositions and immunological properties.
20052465:4	They require pre-testing, using control samples from representative donors with known reactivities to identify batches with low background reactivity and optimal antigen-specific spot production . As serum pools are per definition limited in size, rounds of testing to identify optimal serum batches will have to be repeated on a regular basis.
20052465:5	The use of pre-tested serum batches, therefore, is a restricting factor in its own right.
20052465:6	Results obtained in laboratories with different batches may limit comparability between institutions; similarly, results may differ even when generated within one center after switching to a new serum batch.
20052465:7	It is also well described that serum composition can change over time , which suggests that serum properties also change during long-term storage.
20052465:8	Consequently, if it were possible to undertake ELISPOT assays under serum free conditions without loss of sensitivity, this is likely to reduce the variability of the assay and improve consistency over time and between laboratories.
20052465:9	As yet there has been no collaborative study to evaluate the need for serum in the medium used for the ELISPOT assay across a variety of different protocols.
20052465:10	CIP has, therefore, initiated a proficiency panel with the specific aim of identifying the impact of serum supplemented medium versus serum-free medium on the number of viable cells, background spot production and test performance.
20052465:11	Here, we report that the use of media without serum does not affect the number of viable cells, background spot production, or detection rates, even when different ELISPOT protocols were used.
20052465:12	However, the omission of serum requires ELISPOT protocol optimization for each specific serum-free medium.
20052465:13	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
We have used a multicenter approach to study the impact of serum use in a broad variety of ELISPOT protocols by comparing the performance of 16 different laboratories.
20052465:14	Numbers of viable cells after thawing and resting were similar for both conditions (Fig.  a), demonstrating that cell quality was not compromised in serum-free media.
20052465:15	Similarly, there was little difference between the levels of background spot production under serum and serum-free conditions (Fig.  b), suggesting that serum is not a major factor contributing to background spot detection.
20052465:16	Overall detection rates (expressed as the percentage of detected among potentially detectable responses) did not differ significantly between the two conditions (Fig.  c).
20052465:17	The fact that four laboratories were able to detect >85% responses without serum clearly illustrates that excellent results can be obtained with serum-free protocols.
20052465:18	However, five laboratories (38%) found that the detection rates decreased when they switched from using their serum-containing test medium to a serum-free medium.
20052465:19	It has to be emphasized that 13/16 of the laboratories in this panel employ ELISPOT protocols that had been optimized for the use of serum supplemented medium.
20052465:20	Based on these findings we recommend the use of serum-free protocols to centers that perform ELISPOT assays for monitoring immune responses on a regular basis, as this should eliminate the problems associated with batch-testing and serum stability, and assist in the process of assay harmonization.
20052465:21	Our observations are in line with those from a recent, single center study , which concluded that removal of serum and addition of low-dose IL-7 led to increased test performance when applied to a specific ELISPOT protocol.
20052465:22	During the review process of our paper an additional inter-laboratory study was published by Zhang et al. , where the use of eight different sera was compared to the use of the same serum-free medium in a single optimized protocol.
20052465:23	The results showed that signal to noise ratio increased in the presence of serum, and confirmed that good performance can be achieved using an optimized serum-free protocol.
20052465:24	In contrast, our study of a variety of different locally established protocols clearly shows that removal of serum can increase the performance in some laboratories, while decreasing performance in others (i.e., increased background spot production or lower numbers of antigen-specific spots), and that ELISPOT assays can be successfully performed under completely different but for each laboratory optimized conditions.
20052465:25	We conclude that not all protocols support high performance under serum-free conditions without re-optimization.
20052465:26	The mean detection rate for the tests performed under the routinely established protocol conditions was 65% representing the detection of four (4.55) of the possible seven responses.
20052465:27	This relatively low detection rate is due to two factors.
20052465:28	In this panel phase, two of the seven responses that could have been detected (the two donor–antigen combinations D2/CMV and D4/Flu) were below or equal to six (on average) antigen–specific spots/100,000 PBMC (Table  ).
20052465:29	In order to successfully detect these two very low responses the background spot production should have been less or equal to two spots which is below the mean background spot production usually found in an average lab (CIP, unpublished data).
20052465:30	We, therefore, expected an “average” lab to detect only five of the seven responses which would have been a detection rate of 71.4%.
20052465:31	The second reason for the low overall detection rate was that very strict response definition criteria were applied, which we had defined in previous rounds of inter-laboratory testing . When we applied the more commonly used response definition criterion of twofold (instead of threefold) over background, overall detection rate increased from 65 to 71.8% (for the preferred condition of each lab) clearly showing that the group of participants was experienced and representative of an average laboratory.
20052465:32	The experience from the CIP ELISPOT proficiency panel program and previous findings from Janetzki  strongly suggested that background critically influences the detection rate.
20052465:33	The data from this panel confirm that there is a distinct relationship between the background spot frequency and detection rates (Fig.  ) reinforcing the importance of optimizing assay protocols to generate low backgrounds.
20052465:34	Six of the 16 participating laboratories were able to detect 86–100% of the positive responses (6/7 or 7/7) using their favoured conditions and were identified as “high performers” (Table  ).
20052465:35	Although the performances of these laboratories were qualitatively equivalent, the antigen-specific T cell frequencies were highly variable, ranging between 1 and 13 spots/100,000 PBMC for the lowest response (D2/CMV) and 74–153 spots/100,000 PBMC for the highest response (D3/CMV).
20052465:36	However, these six high performing laboratories reported results with less variation than the remaining ten laboratories (Table  ).
20052465:37	High inter-center variability has been observed previously in proficiency panels organized by us and others , especially with low and moderate frequencies T cells, and it is clear that quantitative comparison of results reported across institutions still remains a major problem in the field.
20052465:38	Results from the current panel continue to illustrate the difficulty in decreasing inter-center variability in the ELISPOT assay, even among experienced laboratories.
20052465:39	To address this issue, broadly available standard samples are urgently needed and may even require the use of the same protocols . This, together with the implementation of external quality testing projects and the generation of a commonly accepted framework to report data from immunomonitoring assays , is a major international challenge for achieving comparability of data across institutions.
20052465:40	Comparison of the protocols used by high performing laboratories revealed that these were different from one another (Table  ); there was no indication that any one factor in the protocol had critically influenced performance with respect to the detection rate of T cell reactivities.
20052465:41	On the other hand, laboratories that used protocols that had many commonalities could have different detection rates.
20052465:42	Similar observations have been made previously by us and others  and suggest that high performance depends on many factors, including the protocol components used by each different laboratory  as well as yet unidentified parameters.
20052465:43	For example, the laboratory environment in which assays are performed may play an important role.
20052465:44	Immunological knowledge, experience, training, high levels of quality control and assay validation   are likely to be the key components of good assay performances.
20052465:45	CIP will now begin to systematically investigate the influence of lab environment, quality assurance and test validation on assay performance.
20052465:46	The current CIP panel was designed to compare the effects of serum supplementation or depletion on different locally established IFNγ ELISPOT protocols, and did not include a systematic comparison of commercially available media for lymphocyte culture and testing.
20052465:47	A number of laboratories of the CIP have actively participated in an independent proficiency panel organized by the Cancer Research Institute’s Cancer Vaccine Consortium (CRI-CVC), which aimed at the comparison of 4 serum-free lymphocyte media with the optimized laboratory medium supplemented with serum .
20052465:48	Although the design of the CRI-CVC panel differed significantly from that of the study reported here, both programs reach similar results which supports the overall conclusion on the use of serum-free test media in ELISPOT assays.
20052465:49	Recent literature suggests that the protocols and conditions (time lines, media, serum supplement, etc.) used for preparing and freezing cellular material critically influence the cell quality and immunological function  . These variables have not yet been systematically investigated within a group applying a range of individual protocols.
20052465:50	CIP and CRI-CVC will, therefore, collaboratively organize a systematic analysis of these variables in a representative testing group to generate a base for rational development for highly sensitive ELISPOT assays with low background spot induction.
20565805:0	Background 
Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that is recognized as one of the most important biological contaminants in drinking water . Cryptosporidiosis is associated with gastrointestinal infection which can be life threatening in immuno-compromised individuals.
20565805:1	The infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route either by direct contact or through contamination of food and water .
20565805:2	An experimental study of healthy adult volunteers revealed that the ingestion of as few as 30 Cryptosporidium oocysts can initiate infection . Water-borne transmission is facilitated by the long-lasting infectivity of the oocyst in the environment and its resistance to conventional water treatment technologies such as chlorination . 
The New York City Watershed is currently the focus of a long-term project investigating the public health risk of waterborne cryptosporidiosis.
20565805:3	Active surveillance in the city which began in 1994 has identified over 100 cases of cryptosporidiosis annually among NYC residents . A quantitative risk assessment model for cryptosporidiosis in NYC predicted that the mean annual risk estimates for infection for all ages and persons with or without HIV/AIDS exceed the proposed acceptable annual risk level of 1 case of infection per 10,000 . 
The New York City water supply system provides drinking water to almost half the population of New York State, which includes over 8 million people in the City and one million in Upstate counties, plus millions of commuters and tourists.
20565805:4	The water is supplied from a network of 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes that contain a total storage capacity of approximately 2 billion cubic meters.
20565805:5	The total watershed area for the system is approximately 5,100 km 2 extending over 200 km north and west of NYC.
20565805:6	The system is dependent on precipitation and subsequent runoff via streams and rivers to supply the reservoirs.
20565805:7	The water is then moved via a series of gravity-fed aqueducts to the distributions system, where it is chlorinated before it reaches the consumers . Pathogens such as Cryptosporidium pose a significant threat to public health in the City's unfiltered water supply, because the oocysts are very resistant to chlorination, and they are regularly detected in reservoir effluents . 
Dairy calves are thought to be a primary source of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum contamination in watershed ecosystems . In the NYC Watershed, the Catskill/Delaware drainage system is home to approximately 200 dairy farms.
20565805:8	To avoid building a huge filtration plant that could cost about $8 billion and the associated $300 million per year for operating costs, NYC implements extensive watershed management measures, including water quality monitoring and best management practices (BMP) on agricultural land, with the goal to protect water quality while maintaining economic viability on these farms . Watershed management requires a network design that demands distinct spatial and temporal monitoring and protection efforts . However to date, the spatial and temporal variation in the risk of C. parvum infection in dairy herds in watersheds has not been investigated.
20565805:9	Understanding the spatial and temporal pattern of C. parvum infection on dairy farms would be useful in designing or modifying watershed management strategies to monitor and mitigate the risk of C. parvum contamination in watersheds.
20565805:10	Bayesian approach has been used increasingly in geographical epidemiologic studies, because it stabilizes crude risk estimates by reducing variance heterogeneity.
20565805:11	Thus, risk maps based on Bayesian rather than crude risk estimates are preferred because they are more accurate and visually appealing . In a Bayesian approach, a prior probability distribution for the values of a parameter (based on previous studies) is converted (under the influence of current observations) to a posterior distribution of that parameter.
20565805:12	This posterior distribution is used to provide an estimate for the parameter . 
The objectives of the study were to 1) explore and map the temporal and spatial dynamics of the risk of C. parvum infection in dairy cattle in the NYC Watershed, and to 2) identify high-risk clusters in space and time.
20565805:13	The study utilized both crude-, and Bayesian prevalence estimates to accurately describe the spatial epidemiology of this important zoonotic parasite among dairy herds in a large watershed ecosystem.
20565805:14	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
We carried out this study to evaluate potential clustering of dairy herds that are infected with C. parvum in the NYC Watershed.
20565805:15	This was the first study to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation in the risk of C. parvum infection in dairy cattle in an important watershed.
20565805:16	The decision to include only pre-weaned calves in this study was based on the results of a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of Cryptosporidium in dairy cattle in the NYC Watershed which revealed, that despite representing only a small proportion of the population and producing a small fraction of manure, pre-weaned calves produced the vast majority of all zoonotic C. parvum oocysts shed within the dairy cattle population.
20565805:17	Specifically, it was estimated that pre-weaned calves produced 99.5% of the total C. parvum oocyst burden with a calculated mean log oocyst shedding of 4.02 × 10 10 daily.
20565805:18	Thus it was estimated that pre-weaned calves produce nearly all the C. parvum oocysts that contaminate the watershed .
20565805:19	One of the assumptions we made in the models was that all C. parvum -like oocysts shed by pre-weaned calves were zoonotic.
20565805:20	We made this assumption because molecular typing is required to determine the zoonotic potential of C. parvum -like oocysts, and this necessity would have further amplified the problem of small numbers.
20565805:21	While over-estimating the zoonotic risk, we felt this assumption was reasonable, because recent studies that applied molecular typing revealed that the majority of Cryptosporidium infections in pre-weaned calves were indeed zoonotic [ , ].
20565805:22	Both global (Moran's I) and specific (SaTScan) cluster detection methods identified a significant spatial cluster of C. parvum infection in calves in the winter, with a relative risk (RR) of 5.8, based on crude risk estimates.
20565805:23	No other purely spatial clusters were identified with either method.
20565805:24	Thus, there was complete agreement between the results of the two cluster detection methods.
20565805:25	In addition, the scan statistics detected a significant space-time cluster in the summer with both circular (RR = 2.3) and elliptical (RR = 3) window settings.
20565805:26	Further investigation revealed the presence of a significant temporal cluster (RR = 2) but the lack of a purely spatial cluster in the summer, which suggests that the space-time clusters identified in the summer were due to a temporal rather than a spatial increase in risk.
20565805:27	The large sizes of the space-time clusters including nearly 50% of the population at risk (maximum allowed under the conditions specified) also supports the notion of a spatially diffuse increase in the risk of C. parvum infection in the summer.
20565805:28	It has been suggested that farms downstream of other farms may be contaminated with Cryptosporidium via runoff from farms upstream, although evidence for this epidemiologic link is lacking [ - ].
20565805:29	The rationale for considering elliptical spatial clusters in this study was that farm-to-farm transmission via runoff would be expected to produce an elliptical rather than a circular cluster.
20565805:30	The term disease cluster is defined as an increase in the expected number of cases within a population bounded in space and time . We used two different cluster detection methods to ensure comparability and robustness of results.
20565805:31	We elected to use the scan statistics for the investigation of temporal and space-time clusters, because recent studies identified SatScan as the most developed and robust space-time surveillance software package that takes multiple testing problems into account, and is considered the most powerful for detecting localized clusters . 
The major limitation of the study was the low number of pre-weaned calves on the farms, resulting in unstable risk estimates as small populations have large variability in rates . For example, the small number of cases and population at risk may have accounted for the high relative risk estimate (RR = 5.8) for the winter spatial cluster.
20565805:32	This limitation was corrected with the use of a Bayesian approach that has the ability to stabilize the raw estimates derived from a small number of individuals . The Bayesian approach also allowed us to incorporate prior knowledge about the risk of C. parvum infection in the target population, and to account for the imperfections of the diagnostic test.
20565805:33	However, the quality of this prior information might influence the quality of the estimate and hence could be a source of bias and limitations . The degree of smoothing provided by the Bayesian approach is a trade-off between high sensitivity (truly high risk areas correctly identified) and high specificity (areas without excessive risk correctly identified) such that sensitive but non-specific measure will generate many false positive findings, whereas a specific but not sensitive measure will miss areas with high risk . In our study we encountered contradictory results in the analysis of purely spatial clusters using Global Moran's I statistics.
20565805:34	While crude estimates revealed significant spatial autocorrelation in the winter, Bayesian estimates indicated the lack of a spatial clustering in any season.
20565805:35	Considering the limitations of using crude vs. Bayesian estimates in spatial analysis, the discrepancy in our results may be due either to the instability of the crude estimates leading to spuriously high values, or to the low sensitivity of the Bayesian model to detect areas with truly high risk.
20565805:36	Cryptosporidium is considered a non-point source pollutant in watersheds that is carried off the land surface during rain events . Monitoring of stream sites in the study area revealed that event based (e.g. after storms) Cryptosporidium concentrations were consistently higher than baseline results (up to 11.7 oocysts 50L -1), implicating runoff as contamination source . The close relationship between activities in the drainage basin and the quality of its water resources forms the underlying premise for all watershed management programs . Best management practices that protect water supply on farms such as fencing, filter strips, stream crossings, animal trails and walkway, manure composting facility, and runoff management systems would ideally and ultimately be implemented on every farm in the watershed.
20565805:37	However, until that goal is achieved, prioritization methodologies to address non-point source pollutants need to be developed, and the identification of "hot spots" is an integral part of this process.
20565805:38	The occurrence of spatial or temporal clusters may be due to rapid spread between locations in the case of a highly contagious disease, or the presence of common environmental risk factors . The higher risk of C. parvum infection on dairy farms in the summer throughout the study area may be due to climatic or management factors that affect the entire area.
20565805:39	This finding suggests that spreading manure in the summer (compared to other seasons) in any area of the watershed is associated with an increased risk of C. parvum contamination of the water supply.
20565805:40	This finding is important because farms in the study area regularly spread untreated calf manure in the fields.
20565805:41	The current recommendation is to avoid spreading manure in the spring and during frozen conditions, while summer is considered a lower risk period . If further studies confirm an increased risk of Cryptosporidium contamination in the summer, this knowledge will be useful to improve Nutrient Management Plans, which give recommendations about the most environmentally safe time and place to spread manure.
20565805:42	With the City's population expected to rise to 9.1 million by 2039 from 8.3 million in 2005, watershed management will continue to have an important part to play in protecting water quality . Over time, systematic and careful monitoring of disease-causing organisms and pollutants will determine the effectiveness of New York City's protection strategies and the continued success of its filtration avoidance plan.
20565805:43	The identification of spatial or temporal "hot-spots" of C. parvum contamination within the watershed will have important implications for watershed monitoring and management, and need to be the focus of future investigations.
20565805:44	Conclusions 
The identification of C. parvum clusters is a priority in designing cost-effective and targeted watershed management practices to ensure safety of the water supplies for public health.
20565805:45	This study identified high risk clusters of C. parvum infection in dairy herds in both space and time in a large and important watershed, suggesting that further studies are needed to determine whether the presence of clusters are persistent and predictable.
20565805:46	We recommend that future studies focus on the causes of these "hot spots" so that watershed monitoring and management strategies may be implemented and targeted to effectively decrease C. parvum contamination of the water supply.

20130794:1	Introduction 
Prolidases (proline-specific dipeptidase) are peptidases with specificity for X-Pro dipeptides.
20130794:2	X-Pro substrates contain N-terminal residues that are hydrophobic/uncharged (Ala-, Ile-, Leu-, Val-), basic (His-), aromatic (Phe-, Tyr-), or sulphur-containing (Met-) . Prolidases only cleave dipeptides with proline at the C terminus (NH 2-X-/-Pro-COOH).
20130794:3	This modification or truncation process can develop either cotranslationally or posttranslationally after the action of an endoproteinase.
20130794:4	Prolidase is widespread in nature and has been isolated from different mammalian tissues   as well as from bacteria, such as the species of Lactobacillus   and Xanthomonas . While the physiological role of prolidase in bacteria is unclear, a deficiency of this enzyme in humans results in abnormalities of the skin and other proline-rich collagenous tissues . In contrast with other endopeptidases and exopeptidases, prolidase is thought to be involved in the terminal degradation of intracellular proteins, and may also function in the recycling of proline.
20130794:5	Prolidase also has biotechnological applications; it has a potential use in the dairy industry as a cheese-ripening agent  because the degradation of proline-containing peptides in cheese reduces bitterness.
20130794:6	Prolidases are also capable of detoxifying organophosphorus nerve agents such as sarin and soman . 
  The crystal structure of prolidase has been solved only from Pyrococcus furiosus , where the main subunit is a “pita-bread” fold containing a metal active center like aminopeptidase P from E. coli  and methionine aminopeptidase from P. furiosus  . Two Zn atoms in the active site of the solved crystalline structure have been found , which are included as an impurity in the crystallization medium.
20130794:7	However, the native prolidase from P. furiosus  requires two Co ions per molecule in the active center for full catalytic activity.
20130794:8	When Co ions are replaced by Zn ions, the protein does not show any enzymatic activity . The structure of the prolidase containing Co ions with full activities remains to be solved.
20130794:9	Recently, the structure of prolidase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (Project ID, PH1149), which has 80% sequence identities with that from P. furiosus has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (1WY2).
20130794:10	This protein also has Zn ions in the active center as observed in the P. furiosus enzyme.
20130794:11	Furthermore, when the structure of a protein annotated as a putative dipeptidase from P. horikoshii (Project ID, PH0974), having 36% sequence identities with PH1149, was solved, no metal ions were found in the active center.
20130794:12	The protein showed substrate specific activities for a dipeptide of Met-Pro, which is a feature of X-Pro dipeptidase (prolidase).
20130794:13	In this paper, the structure of PH0974 ( Ph dpd) is described in detail, and the difference in the structure of PH1149 with Zn ions (Zn- Ph dpd) will be discussed.
20130794:14	In addition, the differences in both proteins in the binding feature of Co or Zn ions and in substrate-specific activities were examined in order to clarify the enzymatic function of this enzyme.

4. Conclusions 
The enzyme assay of Project ID PH0974 ( Ph dpd) of P. horikoshii indicated that Ph dpd has the function of X-pro dipeptidase (prolidase).
20130794:18	The crystal structure of Ph dpd was solved at 2.4 Å resolution, and there are no metal ions in the active site.
20130794:19	Furthermore, DSC experiments suggest that there are big differences in binding constants with Zn between Ph dpd and Zn- Ph dpd.
20130794:20	In order to elucidate why the proteins containing Zn ions do not have the prolidase activity without the addition of Co ions, the three structures of Ph dpd, Zn- Ph dpd, and Zn- Pf prol were compared.
20130794:21	The conclusions were (1) the coordination geometry in the active site of Ph dpd was slightly different from that of Zn- Ph dpd and (2) the important His residue of Zn- Ph dpd, which seems to interact with the nitrogen atoms of the scissile peptide bonds, considerably moved resulting in decreasing the volume of the active site pocket due to Zn binding.
21417351:0	Introduction 
Surfactants normally adsorb to an air−water interface at rates that decrease as the surface tension (γ) falls [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in Figure ].
21417351:1	Insertion into a more densely occupied surface occurs more slowly as γ approaches its equilibrium value (γ e).
21417351:2	Pulmonary surfactant initially demonstrates these kinetics, lowering γ at rates that progressively slow.
21417351:3	The adsorption isotherms, however, can reach an inflection point, and during the final approach to γ e, the slope can become substantially steeper − (Figure ).
21417351:4	Adsorption is likely to be particularly important in this range of γ.
21417351:5	In the lungs, where pulmonary surfactant exerts its biological function, when the alveolar air−water interface expands during inhalation, the rise of γ above γ e is limited.
21417351:6	− The surfactant vesicles therefore most likely adsorb in the alveolus to an air−water interface that has the γ at which the acceleration occurs.
21417351:7	Despite the likely importance of the unexpected accelerated decrease in γ, remarkably little information is available concerning its basic characteristics.
21417351:8	The experiments here test a series of hypotheses concerning the basis of the late acceleration.
21417351:9	Our studies emphasize in particular two fundamental issues: whether the late acceleration reflects a maturation of adsorbing material or changes in the characteristics of the interfacial film; and the extent to which the hydrophobic proteins, which greatly facilitate the adsorption of the surfactant lipids at all γ, are necessary and sufficient to cause the late acceleration.
21417351:10	The results restrict the possible mechanisms by which the accelerated late adsorption can occur.
21417351:11	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Vesicles of extracted calf surfactant (CLSE) at 37 °C lowered γ at rates that initially decreased in magnitude as adsorption progressed (Figure ).
21417351:12	At ∼40 mN/m, however, the adsorption isotherms reached an inflection point and the slopes became steeper.
21417351:13	Control experiments with SDS demonstrated the behavior expected for standard surfactants, with γ falling at progressively slower rates until reaching a constant value (Figure ).
21417351:14	Although present in many prior studies of adsorption, ,− the absence of the late acceleration in some previously published reports raised the possibility that the phenomenon reflected some feature of the manner in which the experiments were conducted.
21417351:15	We therefore tested the dependence of the late acceleration on the following aspects of our protocol.
21417351:16	The steeper slopes at the end of the adsorption isotherm could reflect the relationship between the surface concentration (Γ) and γ rather than a true increase in the rate of adsorption.
21417351:17	If the slope of the γ−Γ isotherm became steeper close to γ e, then at low values, γ would fall more quickly, despite adsorption at a constant rate.
21417351:18	Increasing Γ produced by compression, however, showed only the previously reported,( ) roughly linear decrease in γ from shortly after lift-off to the onset of collapse (Figure ).
21417351:19	Assuming that γ had the same relationship to Γ during compression of a monolayer and during adsorption, the late accelerated fall in γ indicated a faster increase in Γ and more rapid adsorption.
21417351:20	The late acceleration could reflect changes in the film, achieved at a critical γ, or changes in the adsorbing material.
21417351:21	Although the vesicles dispersed in the bulk of the subphase should remain unchanged by the introduction of an interface, material adjacent to the surface might undergo a kinetic transformation that would allow faster adsorption.
21417351:22	The two possibilities of changes in the film or in the adsorbing material predicted opposite dependence on γ and the duration of adsorption.
21417351:23	Accelerated adsorption that occurred because of changes in the film should depend exclusively upon γ, regardless of the time needed to reach the critical value.
21417351:24	A late acceleration that instead reflected changes in the adsorbing material should become apparent in measurements of sufficient duration, independent of the γ.
21417351:25	Adsorption isobars distinguished between kinetic dependence on time and γ.
21417351:26	Isobars, obtained at constant γ, measured rates of adsorption from the change in area, A necessary to maintain γ constant.(
21417351:27	) Assuming that Γ uniquely determined γ, such that, for n constituents confined within A where the variable c had a single value at any particular γ, then for adsorption at constant γ, the fractional rate of change in area would equal the fractional rate at which constituents adsorb to the interface: If the steeper slopes at the end of the adsorption isotherms reflected a maturation of adsorbing material and the passage of time, then adsorption isobars should all become steeper at later times, regardless of the γ that was held constant.
21417351:28	If instead the steeper isotherms occurred because of the lower γ, then the semi-logarithmic isobars should have slopes that remain constant.
21417351:29	These isobaric slopes should show the same dependence on γ as the slope of the adsorption isotherms.
21417351:30	Adsorption at a fixed γ occurred at a constant rate (Figure ).
21417351:31	Plots of ln A versus time were linear (Figure B).
21417351:32	The isobaric measurements extended to times at which adsorption to a constant surface area demonstrated the late acceleration (Figure A).
21417351:33	Changes in the adsorbing material that might have caused the late acceleration in the experiments with a constant surface area should have occurred during the isobaric measurements.
21417351:34	The rate of isobaric adsorption, however, remained unchanged (Figure B).
21417351:35	After the chamber reached its minimum hydrostatic pressure, which prevented further expansion to maintain isobaric conditions, the experiments measured the fall in γ during adsorption to a constant area (Figure A).
21417351:36	The isotherms after the isobaric adsorption paralleled the curves obtained during adsorption to an area that was fixed throughout the entire experiment, demonstrating the same late increase in slope.
21417351:37	Both the constant isobaric rates and the parallel final segments of the isotherms, despite interruption of the fall in γ by a prolonged isobaric interval, argued that the late acceleration occurred when the films reached a critical γ rather than when time achieved a critical duration required for maturation of the adsorbing material.
21417351:38	The steeper slopes close to γ e could still reflect changes in the adsorbing material if the isobaric expansion altered the concentration of constituents immediately adjacent to the surface as well as within the interface.
21417351:39	The classical model of adsorption developed by Ward and Tordai( ) postulates equilibrium between the film and an unstirred layer immediately adjacent to the interface.
21417351:40	If the key step leading to the accelerated adsorption was the maturation of material in the unstirred layer, then isobaric expansion during adsorption might delay that process.
21417351:41	Therefore, experiments also tested whether prespread films, which would greatly shorten the time required to reach a hypothetical critical γ, would advance the onset of the late acceleration.
21417351:42	Conversely, adsorption that required a kinetic process adjacent to the interface should be unaffected by the artificially lowered γ.
21417351:43	The pre-existing films greatly shortened the time required for adsorption to reach γ e (Figure ).
21417351:44	From the initial value of 30−34 mN/m for the prespread films, γ fell during subsequent adsorption along isotherms at least as steep as for vesicles adsorbing to an initially clean interface (Figure ).
21417351:45	The kinetics of adsorption to spread and adsorbed films at the same γ were comparable (Figure ).
21417351:46	The steeper slopes occurred without delay, arguing that maturation of the adsorbing material was unnecessary, and that the onset of the late acceleration depended instead on reaching a critical γ.
21417351:47	Isobaric measurements at different γ directly tested how the rate of adsorption depended on γ.
21417351:48	To minimize the effects of variation among samples, we measured isobaric adsorption at sequentially lower surface tensions for individual samples, alternatively holding γ or area constant, during the course of a single experiment (Figure A).
21417351:49	During the isobaric segments, ln A again varied linearly with time (Figure A).
21417351:50	In each experiment, the rates of isobaric adsorption initially fell at progressively lower γ, but then increased just above γ e (Figure B).
21417351:51	The sequential isobars provided further support that γ determined the onset of the accelerated late adsorption.
21417351:52	To test how the different components of pulmonary surfactant contributed to the late acceleration, our experiments used preparations obtained from CLSE by removing specific constituents.
21417351:53	Collection of appropriate fractions eluted from a gel-permeation column separated CLSE into preparations containing the surfactant proteins and phospholipids (SP&PL), without cholesterol; the surfactant proteins and modified phospholipids (SP&mPL), lacking cholesterol and the anionic phospholipids; and the neutral and phospholipids (N&PL), without the proteins.
21417351:54	,, Comparing the adsorption of these different preparations indicated the role played in the complete biological mixture by the omitted constituents.
21417351:55	Removal of cholesterol from CLSE had little effect on adsorption (Figure ).
21417351:56	The isotherms for CLSE and SP&PL, which differ only in their content of cholesterol, were similar.
21417351:57	At γ ≈ 35 mN/m, the curves for both preparations became steeper, with the slope achieving greater magnitude for SP&PL than for CLSE (Figure B).
21417351:58	The additional removal of the anionic phospholipids to yield SP&mPL slowed adsorption generally (Figure A), but the late acceleration persisted, with relatively little change in the steeper slopes at ∼30 mN/m (Figure B). Removal of only the proteins slowed adsorption further and prevented N&PL from reaching γ below 50 mN/m (Figure A).
21417351:59	Our experiments were not designed to distinguish whether further adsorption without the proteins ceased completely or simply slowed to an undetectable rate, but during measurements extended to 6 h, N&PL produced no further change in γ.
21417351:60	These results fell short of proving that the accelerated late adsorption required the proteins.
21417351:61	The absence of the proteins might prevent γ from ever reaching a critical value, but have no effect on subsequent adsorption if the film artificially achieved that γ.
21417351:62	To test whether vesicles could adsorb rapidly at lower γ without the proteins, experiments measured adsorption of vesicles with and without the proteins to monolayers of N&PL prespread to γ ≈ 30 mN/m (Figure ).
21417351:63	At these low γ, vesicles of N&PL were ineffective.
21417351:64	Injection of the N&PL vesicles produced an initial drop of γ below the value for the pre-existing film by <2 mN/m but no further decrease in γ (Figure ).
21417351:65	Control experiments confirmed that vesicles of CLSE, with the proteins, adsorbed readily to the films of N&PL.
21417351:66	At γ above ∼50 mN/m, insertion into the interface could occur slowly for the lipids alone (Figure ), but adsorption at lower γ, including for the final accelerated approach to γ e, required the proteins.
21417351:67	The importance of the proteins suggested that their concentration within the interface might explain the late acceleration.
21417351:68	Prior studies have shown that the proteins increase the rate of adsorption, whether they are located in the vesicles or at the air−water interface.
21417351:69	If the contents of a vesicle insert collectively, then during adsorption, the composition of the nascent film and its fractional content of protein would remain constant.
21417351:70	The absolute Γ of the proteins, however, would increase as adsorption progressed.
21417351:71	The increased availability of protein at the point of contact between the vesicles and the film, contributed from both sides of the junction, might cause adsorption to accelerate at Γ above a critical value.
21417351:72	Experiments with vesicles of CLSE adsorbing to pre-existing films of N&PL tested that possibility.
21417351:73	During adsorption of CLSE to initial films of N&PL, the Γ of protein at any γ would be lower than for CLSE adsorbed to an initially clean interface.
21417351:74	The pre-existing film of N&PL would delay the point at which the adsorbing CLSE would reach the hypothetical critical Γ of protein, and the onset of the late acceleration would shift to a lower γ.
21417351:75	The films of N&PL produced the predicted slowing of the initial adsorption.
21417351:76	Despite starting at higher γ, vesicles adsorbing to an initially clean interface quickly reached lower γ than adsorption to a pre-existing film (Figure ).
21417351:77	These results fit with the effect of interfacial protein on adsorption.
21417351:78	The onset of the late acceleration, however, occurred at the same γ, unaffected by the Γ of N&PL in pre-existing films (Figure ).
21417351:79	The equilibrium isotherm (Figure ) indicated that, at γ e, the Γ of protein in films formed by adsorption to N&PL with γ ≈ 50 mN/m would be 30% of the value for CLSE adsorption to a clean interface.
21417351:80	The inflection point of the kinetic isotherms nonetheless occurred at a γ that was unchanged (Figure ).
21417351:81	The late acceleration was unrelated to a critical Γ of protein.
21417351:82	An additional possible compositional factor in the films concerned the lipids.
21417351:83	Previous reports have suggested that the structural discontinuity between coexisting phases within a leaflet might represent an important focus for the initiation of fusion between two bilayers.(
21417351:84	) To test whether the accelerated late adsorption required the presence of an interfacial boundary within the lipids, in either the vesicular bilayer or the interfacial film, we measured γ during adsorption of vesicles containing the proteins with a single phospholipid present as a single phase at temperatures well above its L β′−L α transition.(
21417351:85	) Vesicles of the SPs with DOPC produced adsorption isotherms similar in shape to traces for CLSE, including the inflection point and the steeper slopes just above γ e (Figure ).
21417351:86	Coexisting phases were unnecessary to produce the late acceleration.
21417351:87	The dependence of the accelerated late adsorption on both γ and the presence of the proteins suggested that, at a certain Γ, the proteins, the phospholipids, or both achieved a configuration that allowed more favorable interaction of the nascent film with the adsorbing vesicles.
21417351:88	To test whether the proteins or the phospholipids represented the more important component, we used other lipids, unrelated to pulmonary surfactant, to determine if vesicles without proteins would also demonstrate the late acceleration.
21417351:89	Compounds that induce lipid leaflets to adopt negative curvature, with a concave hydrophobic face, promote faster adsorption.
21417351:90	,, The phosphatidylethanolamines, which under appropriate conditions form the negatively curved inverse hexagonal (H II) phase, provide a well-documented example of this effect.
21417351:91	,, Our experiments used mixtures of DOPE/DOPC (8:2, mol/mol) at ambient temperatures.
21417351:92	Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which at higher temperatures detected coexisting L α and H II phases, showed only lamellar structures below 48 °C (Figure ).
21417351:93	At 23 °C, these mixtures contained only vesicles, without H II aggregates.
21417351:94	Adsorption should involve the insertion of vesicles, directly comparable to the process for CLSE.
21417351:95	The kinetics of adsorption for DOPE/DOPC varied more than for the vesicles with the SPs.
21417351:96	For seven experiments at 1.0 mM phospholipid, the time to reach γ e extended from 8 to 48 min.
21417351:97	The isotherms, however, were similar in shape to each other and to the curves for CLSE.
21417351:98	If normalized to the total time required to reach γ e, the adsorption isotherms were reproducible (Figure ).
21417351:99	After an initial acceleration, γ fell at rates that decreased until reaching an inflection point at ∼40 mN/m, after which the slopes became steeper.
21417351:100	The late acceleration of adsorption for vesicles that lacked the proteins suggested that the critical structural change at low γ occurred in the lipids rather than the proteins.
21417351:101	Discussion 
The faster rate at which pulmonary surfactant lowers γ close to γ e results from faster adsorption.
21417351:102	Our results rule out the alternative explanation that the steeper slopes reflect the relationship between γ and Γ.
21417351:103	The adsorption of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) provides an example of that other possibility.(
21417351:104	) During the first-order transition between coexisting phases within the monolayer, increasing the Γ of DMPC produces little change in γ.
21417351:105	After completing the transition, the slope of the γ−Γ equilibrium isotherm becomes steeper.
21417351:106	Consequently during adsorption, γ can fall more rapidly after coexistence without a faster increase in Γ.
21417351:107	For spread monolayers of CLSE and SP−DOPC, the γ−Γ isotherms include no isobaric plateaus (Figure ).
21417351:108	The equation of state that relates γ and Γ provides no explanation for the accelerated drop in γ, whether from phase coexistence or any other mechanism.
21417351:109	The kinetics by which surfactants adsorb to an interface have been considered most commonly in terms of sequential steps.
21417351:110	Surfactants first diffuse across an unstirred layer to reach the surface and then insert into the interface.
21417351:111	Insertion may require nothing more than arrival at the interface, or a major reconfiguration may be necessary, involving significant energy of activation.
21417351:112	Surfactants can be classified according to whether rates of adsorption depend on diffusion, the actual insertion into the interface, or both processes.(
21417351:113	) For adsorption determined strictly by the rate of diffusion, expressions that describe the accumulation of adsorbed material simplify considerably if the reverse process of desorption can be ignored,( ) which is reasonable for the insoluble compounds considered here.
21417351:114	The rate of adsorption dominated by diffusion should then depend on (time) −1/2.( ) That dependence indicates that diffusion cannot explain the kinetics observed here.
21417351:115	The late acceleration instead suggests a process of insertion that changes as adsorption proceeds.
21417351:116	These changes in adsorption could result from alterations in either the absorbing material or the interfacial film.
21417351:117	Material adjacent to the interface might undergo the sort of maturation that occurs during adsorption of vesicles to solid supports.
21417351:118	− Vesicles first adhere to the support and then disrupt to form attached disks.
21417351:119	The sequential steps face different restrictions.
21417351:120	Vesicles attach to the solid support only if they exceed a critical size, for which the favorable energy of adhesion is greater than the unfavorable energy of bending at the perimeter of the flattened vesicle.
21417351:121	The subsequent step, in which the attached vesicle disrupts to form disks, is restricted to vesicles above a larger size by the line tension between the perimeter of the disk and the surrounding aqueous environment.
21417351:122	Vesicles between those two critical sizes can adhere but not proceed to form disks.
21417351:123	Adherent vesicles can increase their size and become capable of disruption by fusing.
21417351:124	An analogous maturation of vesicles adjacent to the air−water interface represents one process that might explain the late increase in rates of adsorption.
21417351:125	Our results show, however, that the late acceleration is a characteristic of the films rather than the adsorbing material.
21417351:126	Instead of requiring a critical duration during which the adjacent material undergoes some functional change, the late acceleration begins when γ reaches a critical value.
21417351:127	Prespread films, used to advance the reduction in γ, produce an earlier onset of the late acceleration (Figure ).
21417351:128	Adsorption to these prespread films occurs at approximately the same rate as to adsorbed films at the same γ (Figure ).
21417351:129	Interruptions of the fall in γ by intervals of isobaric adsorption have no effect on the subsequent fall in γ (Figure ).
21417351:130	Prolonged isobaric adsorption occurs at a constant rate, with no evidence for a time-dependent change (Figure B).
21417351:131	Isobaric experiments show the same dependence of adsorption rates on γ as the slope of the adsorption isotherm, including the increase in rates at low γ (Figure ).
21417351:132	In each of these several experimental approaches, the rate of adsorption reflects only γ rather than time, with rates that are faster rather than slower below a critical γ.
21417351:133	This distinction argues that the late acceleration results from changes in the films rather than a maturation of the adsorbing material.
21417351:134	Our results suggest that the late acceleration may represent a characteristic of adsorption by fusion between the inserting vesicle and the nascent film.
21417351:135	The SPs and DOPE, which both induce the late acceleration (Figures and ), both also promote the fusion of vesicles.
21417351:136	,, To the best of our knowledge, an accelerated fall in γ has not been reported for adsorption of micelle-forming surfactants that insert into an interface as individual monomers.
21417351:137	Fusion between vesicles begins with the outer leaflets merging to form a single continuous structure, in which lipids diffuse freely over the otherwise intact vesicles.(
21417351:138	) Adsorption would proceed by a comparable process, in which the outer leaflet of the adsorbing vesicle would first merge with the nascent film before the constituents would insert into the interface as a collective unit.
21417351:139	The evidence that vesicles adsorb by fusion is incomplete.
21417351:140	The mixing of lipids between the adsorbing vesicle and the interfacial film, comparable to mixing between the outer leaflets of fusing vesicles, remains unconfirmed.
21417351:141	The preponderance of data, however, favors adsorption by fusion.
21417351:142	Compounds that form structures with spontaneous curvature similarly promote or inhibit both adsorption and the fusion of vesicles.
21417351:143	,,,,, Constituents that affect both adsorption and fusion have similar effects when added to either of the leaflets that will merge.
21417351:144	,, MLVs, which are large enough to allow microscopic visualization, adsorb as intact structures.
21417351:145	Adsorption would occur by merger of the vesicleʼs outer leaflet with the nascent film, followed by insertion of its constituents as a collective unit.
21417351:146	The late acceleration would then reflect a greater susceptibility of the film to fusion with the adsorbing vesicle below a critical γ.
21417351:147	Our results reject two possible explanations suggested by previous reports that would reflect local characteristics of the film caused by the protein or the lipids.
21417351:148	Because the proteins can promote adsorption at the interface as well as in vesicles, the lower γ might reflect the higher Γ of the proteins and the greater likelihood that a protein, contributed from either of the fusing structures, would be present to stabilize the initial merged structure.
21417351:149	For adsorption of CLSE, however, pre-existing films that change the relationship between the Γ of the proteins and γ have no effect on the γ at which the late acceleration begins (Figure ).
21417351:150	With the lipids, the separation of phases within the film, which varies with γ, provides a structural discontinuity that might facilitate the initial merger between two leaflets.
21417351:151	Vesicles of the SPs with DOPC occur as a single phase under the conditions used here( ) yet undergo a well-defined late acceleration (Figure ).
21417351:152	Phase separation in the lipids and the Γ of the proteins are both unlikely to explain the late acceleration.
21417351:153	The kinetics of adsorption at different γ most likely reflect structural changes in the film.
21417351:154	Those changes could occur either in the small amount of protein that greatly facilitates adsorption or in the lipids that constitute most of the film.
21417351:155	Our results with DOPE/DOPC, which show the same late acceleration in the absence of the proteins (Figure ), suggest that the crucial change occurs in the lipids.
21417351:156	Our experiments provide no information on the structure of the proteins and cannot rule out the prior suggestion that lower γ causes a functionally important conformational change in the proteins.(
21417351:157	) The late acceleration with samples containing only lipids, however, supports the paradoxical initial impression that interfacial lipids more rapidly accommodate the insertion of additional material when they are more densely packed.
21417351:158	The specific changes in the structure of the lipids that allow faster adsorption at lower γ remain uncertain.
21417351:159	The dramatic acceleration of adsorption at a specific γ suggests a qualitative change in the structure of the film, such as occurs at a percolation threshold.
21417351:160	No basis for such a qualitative change, however, is readily apparent.
21417351:161	Several characteristics of spread monolayers change quantitatively when they are compressed to higher densities.
21417351:162	The alteration that seems most likely to allow better interaction with the outer leaflet of the adsorbing vesicle is the tilt of the acyl chains away from the plane of the interface, which increases at higher Γ.( ) The hydrophobic thickness of the merging leaflets would then be similar.
21417351:163	Approaches that would vary the tilt of the lipids without changing γ unfortunately are unavailable.
21417351:164	Exactly which structural changes in the films cause adsorption to accelerate remains the object of speculation.
21417351:165	In summary, our findings show that the more rapid fall in γ close to γ e observed for vesicles of pulmonary surfactant reflects faster adsorption.
21417351:166	The faster rates most likely reflect the greater susceptibility of the lipid monolayer to fusion with the adsorbing vesicle because of structural changes at lower γ.
19920886:0	INTRODUCTION 
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and its complications [pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome) are not only common preventable causes of hospital death but also a source of substantial long-term morbidity . 
The pathogenesis of DVT involves an interaction between hereditary and acquired conditions [ - ].
19920886:1	Generally, DVT occurring in the setting of a recognized risk factor is defined as secondary, whereas that occurring in the absence of risk factors is termed primary or idiopathic . 
In primary DVT, tendency toward venous thrombosis could arise from hyperactive coagulation pathway, hypoactive anticoagulant mechanisms, or hypoactive fibrinolysis .
19920886:2	With the identification of the well-characterized risk factors associated with secondary DVT, there is increasing interest in the laboratory identification of primary thrombotic risk factors.
19920886:3	Identification of these risk factors may affect treatment and identify other affected family members before the onset of symptoms.
19920886:4	This could justify the use of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy during high-risk periods . 
Over the past few years, studies have focused on the role of mutations in genes that encode proteins involving thrombosis pathways.
19920886:5	Prothrombin (factor II) is one of these proteins.
19920886:6	It is the precursor of the serine protease thrombin, a key enzyme acting as a procoagulant, through platelet activation and the generation of fibrin and factors Va, VIIIa, and XIIIa, and subsequently as an anticoagulant, by activating circulating protein C . Therefore, regulation of thrombin activity is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance . The gene encoding prothrombin is 21-kb-long located on chromosome 11, position 11p11-q12 . The prothrombin gene is organized in 14 exons, separated by 13 introns with the 5′ upstream untranslated (UT) region and the 3′- UT region which may play regulatory roles in gene expression .
19920886:7	One genetic variation in the 3′-UT region of the prothrombin gene is the G to A transition at nucleotide position 20210, at or near the cleavage site of the mRNA precursor to which poly A is added .
19920886:8	This is termed as the factor II G 20210 A mutation.
19920886:9	In 1996, Poort et al . reported that the factor II G20210A mutation is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis . Several studies confirmed this initial observation . 
The prevalence of carriers of factor II G20210A mutation in healthy Northern Europeans is 1.7% whereas in Southern Europeans the prevalence is nearly double (3%) . In contrast, factor II G20210A mutation was found in only 1 of 441 African Americans  and was completely absent among 231 Amerindians from Brazil and 210 Japanese subjects .
19920886:10	Patients with this heterozygous gene mutation have increased prothrombin levels and therefore, a thrombotic tendency . 
In this study we assessed the presence of the factor II G20210A mutation in DVT patients especially in those who showed poor response to warfarin therapy.
19920886:11	PATIENTS AND METHODS 
This is a prospective comparative study.
19920886:12	The studied population included 80 patients with acute DVT and 30 healthy blood donor controls of both sexes, residing in the Suez Canal area in Egypt.
19920886:13	Clinical diagnosis of acute DVT (Department of Surgery – Suez Canal University Hospital) was confirmed by Duplex scan.
19920886:14	The Department of Surgery was also responsible for the initial and maintenance anticoagulation therapy.
19920886:15	Patients with previous history of DVT (in the same or other site) were defined as recurrent DVT, and those with DVT history in first degree relatives were defined as having a positive family history.
19920886:16	Data collection included other DVT risk factors such as: complete bed rest for more than 3 days, recent surgery (thoracic, abdominal, pelvic or major lower extremity orthopedic procedure within the previous week), major trauma (fracture [e.g. pelvic, femoral or tibial), spinal cord injuries or associated with major venous injury], use of contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy and the coexistence of varicose veins or neoplasia . Drug history (specially interacting with anticoagulants) was checked.
19920886:17	Exclusion criteria: Patients receiving drugs that interact with warfarin were excluded, as well as pregnant females as oral anti-coagulants are contraindicated during pregnancy . 
All patients received low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin (Clexane) 1 mg/kg/12h subcutaneously for 5 days, with a dose of 5 mg for 2 days.
19920886:18	Warfarin dose was adjusted to reach International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 . 
The study population was divided into 2 groups: the first group was the Poor Responders, defined as the DVT patients who fail to reach the intended level of INR with the usual dose of warfarin (usually 1 - <9 mg/day), those patients usually require more than 9 mg/day to reach the therapeutic INR level [ - ]; we recruited 40 patients during the study period.
19920886:19	This first group was compared with a second group of 40 randomly selected DVT Normal Responders, defined as those who reached an INR between 2 and 3.
19920886:20	In addition, a control group of 30 healthy blood donors living in the same area were randomly selected; none of them had a previous history of DVT.
19920886:21	Factor II gene mutation, protein S, protein C, anti-thrombin III and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were assessed in all DVT patients and controls.
19920886:22	Prothrombin time and INR were assessed in DVT patients before induction of therapy.
19920886:23	RESULTS 
Sex and age distribution in the studied groups are shown in Table . Median age in the 3 groups was similar.
19920886:24	Regarding the site of DVT, the superficial femoral vein was the affected in 35% and 30 % of the poor responders and normal responders, respectively, followed by the popliteal vein in 25% and 27.5 % and only 3% and 5 % of the patients had iliac DVT.
19920886:25	In the remaining 37% of the poor responders and 37.5% of the normal responders the affected vein was either the anterior or the posterior tibial vein.
19920886:26	Forty five percent of the poor responders and 40% of the normal responders had no risk factors.
19920886:27	In the remaining patients of both groups, these risk factors were comparable and not significant.
19920886:28	Except for recurrent DVT which was higher in the poor responders group (25%) than the normal responders (10%); (Table ).
19920886:29	The laboratory results of the inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors in the studied groups are shown in Table . Protein C, S and antithrombin III deficiencies were observed only in the poor responders group.
19920886:30	The non Prothrombin mutation abnormalities (Protein C, anti-thrombin III and ACA) were present in 10 poor responders vs 0 controls (p = 0.0037).
19920886:31	ACA was significantly higher in poor responder than in the control subjects (p<0.034).
19920886:32	Regarding the prothrombin gene mutation, homozygous mutation was observed in only 1 patient in the poor responders group.
19920886:33	Heterozygous mutation of the PT gene was observed in the 3 studied groups, but it was higher in the poor responders than in the normal responder and control groups (12, 6 and 1 subject, respectively).
19920886:34	The difference between the poor responders and the normal controls was highly significant p=0.002 (Table ).
19920886:35	This table also shows the distribution of other thrombophilic risk factors.
19920886:36	Table shows that the positive factor II G20210A mutation was significantly (p<0.0001) more frequent among patients with a history of recurrent DVT or a positive family history of DVT compared with the other DVT patients.
19920886:37	DISCUSSION 
On treating patients with acute DVT, we faced patients who did not show the usual elevation of PT/INR in response to usual doses of warfarin.
19920886:38	This may reflect an elevated prothrombin level due to a genetic mutation .
19920886:39	This mutation may, not only, cause the low response to oral anticoagulant, but may also contribute to the recent and future episodes of DVT .
19920886:40	Patients with this gene mutation may need higher doses of warfarin (to reach INR target levels) for longer periods . 
In the present study, analysis of risk factors showed that recurrent DVT was numerically higher but not significant in the poor responders than for the normal responders.
19920886:41	Family history was also higher in the poor responders, but not significantly so.
19920886:42	This may reflect the presence of a specific risk factor for DVT in the poor responders group.
19920886:43	The rest of the risk factors showed similarity with no significant differences between the poor and normal responders.
19920886:44	This agrees with the fact that these are recognised risk factors that may cause DVT in all patients.
19920886:45	It also suggests that multiple risk factors might be necessary before clinically evident DVT develops even in patients with thrombotic gene mutation . 
We detected the factor II G20210A mutation in 20 individuals in our study population (n=110).
19920886:46	Homozygous mutation was found in only 1 patient in the poor responders group, while heterozygous mutation was found in the 3 groups.
19920886:47	The gene mutation was recognized in 1(3.4%) of the normal population, which agrees with others who found this mutation in 1%, 1.7% and 3% of the normal Pakistan, Northern and Southern European population, respectively [ , ].
19920886:48	However, our finding only represents the 30 studied healthy blood donors.
19920886:49	Larger studies are needed to define the exact prevalence in our community.
19920886:50	Heterozygous gene mutation was found in 30% of the poor responders and 15% of the normal responders.
19920886:51	This supports the concept that factor II G20210A mutation may cause high prothrombin levels  which may, in turn, be responsible for resisting oral anticoagulants.
19920886:52	The presence of the same mutation in some normal responders may be explained by the presence of different degrees of mutation that did not clinically affect the prothrombin levels.
19920886:53	This gene mutation with less clinical significance was previously suggested . 
Our findings agree with previous reports that suggested 3 to 6 fold higher risk of developing DVT in prothrombin gene mutation patients than the normal population . This also points to the importance of screening the patient’s family as they may be at increased risk of developing DVT.
19920886:54	However, the interpretation of our results is limited by the small sample size and selection bias.
19920886:55	Protein C, anti-thrombin III and ACA abnormalities were found in more poor responders DVT patients than controls.
19920886:56	Bernd et al .  suggested that special caution is needed when giving anticoagulants to patients with protein C deficiency.
19920886:57	Because protein C is a vitamin K dependent factor, the administration of warfarin could lead to sudden decrease in protein C before any noticeable decrease in coagulation factors.
19920886:58	This could cause enhanced thrombosis and diffuse skin necrosis.
19920886:59	Also, ACA was significantly more common in poor responders than control subjects.
19920886:60	It has also been suggested that patients with ACA and venous thromboembolism are resistant to usual intensities of warfarin therapy, which may prompt more intense anticoagulation of these patients.
19920886:61	However, no substantial difference was seen between the ACA-positive and ACA-negative patients, for several thromboplastins . 
To add to the dilemma of DVT and genetic disorders, pharmacogenetic studies should be ideally be carried out in DVT patients before warfarin anticoagulant therapy as Leung et al . 2007  reported that patients with Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, or VKORC1*2 genotype (c.-1639G>A) in presence of Factor V Leiden and/or factor II G20210A mutation require significantly reduced doses, and are at a higher risk of serious bleeding.
19920886:62	In conclusion, our findings suggest that factor II G20210A mutation may be more common in DVT patients who are poor responders to warfarin.
19920886:63	Factor II G20210A mutation was more common in patients with recurrent DVT or positive family history of DVT.
17298164:0	Introduction 
As much as untreated tuberculosis (TB) threatens the well being of an individual and society, defaulting from treatment may increase the risk of drug resistance, relapse, and death, and may prolong infectiousness  . In resource-constrained settings where the health care services are not well developed, delayed presentation for treatment and defaulting from treatment are the two major challenges that TB programmes face . The idea of direct observation of treatment (DOT) evolved from the need to improve treatment adherence.
17298164:1	However, the role of DOT in maintaining treatment adherence appears to be surrounded by controversies.
17298164:2	Reports from many countries favour DOT as a key component in the Directly Observed Treatment—Short Course (DOTS) strategy, a global strategy recommended by the World Health Organization for the prevention and control of TB  . Conversely, some randomised controlled studies have failed to establish the superiority of DOT over the conventional nonobserved treatment in improving treatment adherence . As such, ensuring successful treatment completion might require addressing multiple factors beyond simple supervision of drug intake  . 
TB continues to be a major public health problem in Ethiopia, which ranks seventh by estimated number of cases among the 22 TB high-burden countries . Before the introduction of DOTS in Ethiopia, 82% of TB patients were reported to have failed to complete treatment , while defaulting from DOTS in a southeastern part of the country was reported to be as low as 11.3% . In the southern region of Ethiopia (Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples' Regional State), DOTS was introduced in 1996.
17298164:3	An earlier study on the impact of DOTS in the region reported a significantly declining trend in treatment noncompletion from 38% to 18% over six years during 1994–2000 .
17298164:4	However, one in five patients still continued to default from treatment, and its predictors are not well understood.
17298164:5	Apart from physical access, such factors as socioeconomic status, educational level, and patient satisfaction with the care provided may influence treatment adherence.
17298164:6	In an effort to reach the global target of 85% treatment success, it was compelling to identify, describe, and deal with factors determining treatment adherence.
17298164:7	The current study, therefore, was aimed at determining factors that predict treatment adherence among the most infectious form of TB, smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB+) patients.
17298164:8	Methods 
Results 
 shows the flow of study participants.
17298164:9	A total of 404 new PTB+ patients were registered for treatment between 1 September 2002 and 30 April 2004.
17298164:10	Of these, 82% ( n = 331) were from Hadiya zone and 43% ( n = 174) were female patients.
17298164:11	A total of 21% ( n = 83) of the patients had treatment follow-up at Hossana Hospital, whereas 43% ( n = 169) and 36% ( n = 139) were treated at the health centres and health stations, respectively.
17298164:12	A total of 199 patients (49%) volunteered to have HIV testing, of which 12% (25 out of 199) were positive for HIV.
17298164:13	A total of 81 patients (20%) defaulted from treatment, while 310 (77%) successfully completed treatment; nine (2.2%) died, one had treatment failure, and three had moved outside the region and could not be traced.
17298164:14	presents the baseline characteristics of the study participants.
17298164:15	During the first two months following the intensive phase, two-thirds of the defaulters interrupted treatment.
17298164:16	Overall, 91% of the incidences of defaulting from treatment occurred during the continuation phase of treatment.
17298164:17	In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with treatment noncompletion included participant over the age of 25 y, rural residence, educational level, occupation, distance from residence to the nearest treatment centre, need for public transport to get to a treatment centre, and the patient's condition on treatment initiation, as shown in . No significant association was noted between default from treatment and gender, average family income, HIV status, treatment centre, prior knowledge about TB, and knowledge about treatment duration.
17298164:18	In multivariate analysis, three variables—age, distance from home to treatment centre, and need to use public transport to get to a treatment centre—appeared in the last step of the Cox regression model with backward elimination.
17298164:19	Both forward and backward fittings produced the same model.
17298164:20	After simultaneously controlling for the potential predictor variables, distance from home to treatment centre (HR = 2.97; p < 0.001), age over 25 y (HR = 1.71; p = 0.02), and necessity to use public transport to get to a treatment centre (HR = 1.59; p = 0.06) remained independent risk factors for treatment noncompletion.
17298164:21	shows time on treatment by walking distance from treatment centre, adjusted by Cox regression analysis.
17298164:22	It was possible to trace and advise 74 of the 81 defaulters to resume medication.
17298164:23	A single open-ended question was posed to each defaulter case before advising them to resume treatment, “Can you tell me why you discontinued taking TB medication before the required period?”
17298164:24	As shown in the major reasons given by 45% of the patients for interrupting treatment were those related to physical access (TB clinic too far from home, could not afford transportation cost, and too tired to walk to the treatment centre).
17298164:25	Erroneous sense of cure, loss of hope in the medication, and inadequate knowledge about treatment duration were also among the reasons mentioned by the patients.
17298164:26	Discussion 
This study tried to measure the extent and predictors of treatment noncompletion in a predominantly rural society.
17298164:27	A total of one-fifth of the registered PTB+ cases failed to complete treatment.
17298164:28	This finding confirms an earlier study report that documented a declining trend in default rate from 38% to 18% over a six-year period from 1994 to 2000 . The default rate in our study is lower compared to previous studies in some African countries  .
17298164:29	However, it is higher than the 11.6% default rate from DOTS reported in Arsi zone of Ethiopia . Treatment noncompletion is required to fall below 10% in order to achieve treatment success of 85%, one of the health-related indicators of the Millennium Development Goals . 
Most of the factors associated with treatment noncompletion, apart from the patient's age and level of education, are those related to physical access to health-care services: distance from home to treatment centre, rural residence, and a need to use public transport for ambulatory care.
17298164:30	A single open-ended question to the defaulters also elucidated responses that are consistent with this finding.
17298164:31	In other settings, risk factors such as knowledge about treatment duration, change of treatment unit, running out of drugs, poor patient–health provider communication, and medication side effects were reported to have been associated with treatment noncompletion  . 
The prospective design of this study has allowed recording of potential risk factors for treatment noncompletion at the beginning of the study.
17298164:32	As a result, the risk of recall bias, which is an inherent problem of retrospective study designs, is taken into account.
17298164:33	This design would also help to predict the probability of defaulting from treatment right at the start of treatment based on the patient's sociodemographic and environmental context.
17298164:34	However, this approach has its own limitations.
17298164:35	For example, events during the course of treatment, such as drug side effects and care provider–patient interactions, which could considerably influence a patient's decision to continue treatment, were not measured.
17298164:36	Such factors cannot be recorded at the beginning of the study, and a combined approach may have yielded better results.
17298164:37	Furthermore, fewer than half of the patients volunteered for HIV screening, and as a result, we are not able to determine how much, if at all, HIV status influences treatment adherence in our study setting.
17298164:38	While it is recognised that only half of the population in this setting lives within reach of a health facility in a two-hour walk , 72% of the patients in our study cohort came from within this circle.
17298164:39	Fewer patients came from areas not within reach of a health facility in a two-hour walk, and nearly half of these patients failed to complete treatment.
17298164:40	As such, physical access seems to be the most significant determinant of treatment noncompletion in this predominantly rural setting, and its role in health-care seeking warrants further investigation.
17298164:41	Age also appears to be another significant predictor for defaulting in this setting.
17298164:42	One possible explanation is that older people assume more family responsibility and, as a result, this group of individuals may tend to stop medication when they feel better or when they come across more pressing social obligations.
17298164:43	It is also possible that older people gain less attention in the provision of health care, and this warrants further investigation.
17298164:44	Although 15% of defaulters in our study mentioned that they stopped taking medication because they thought they had completed the treatment, there was no statistically significant difference between the defaulters and nondefaulters with regard to knowledge about treatment duration.
17298164:45	There was also no difference between these groups regarding intention to discontinue treatment if and when their symptoms disappeared.
17298164:46	However, 26% of defaulters mentioned “feeling better” as the main reason for discontinuing treatment.
17298164:47	This indicates that distance, the strongest predictor of treatment interruption in this area, may act synergistically with other factors such as feeling better, loss of hope, unaffordable transportation costs, and drug side effects to influence adherence to treatment.
17298164:48	Future research in this area should address the complex interplay between such factors and explore possible interventions to improve treatment adherence.
17298164:49	Decentralisation of treatment follow-up to community health posts and improved patient–provider communication on treatment duration are among options to be explored further.
17298164:50	Peer-encouragement mechanisms such as the formation of “TB clubs” have also been shown to be an effective community-based approach in enhancing treatment completion . In an effort to reduce the access gap to health care, the Ethiopian government has started a new community-based initiative called the “Health Service Extension Programme.”
17298164:51	Under this programme, thousands of health extension agents have been identified and trained, which might help to enhance case-holding under the DOTS programme through decentralisation of services in the country . 
In this study, more than 90% of the defaulters discontinued treatment during the continuation phase of treatment, particularly during the first two months following the two-month intensive phase of treatment.
17298164:52	One of the explanations for this finding might be that during this phase most of the symptoms disappear and patients may erroneously believe they are cured.
17298164:53	This may encourage them to become reluctant to bear the extra burden of the cost of travel, time, and drug side effects.
17298164:54	On the contrary, the condition may remain the same or even be worsened by such conditions as HIV/AIDS or resistance of the bacilli to anti-TB medication, and patients may lose hope for improvement after having made every effort during the first two months.
17298164:55	A better understanding of treatment default timing in most patients may help programme managers to better plan ahead for how to reduce this problem.
17298164:56	Furthermore, the importance of good rapport between patients and care providers in proper treatment adherence cannot be overemphasised.
17298164:57	Although the reported death rate in this study cohort is only 2.2%, there is a possibility of more deaths among patients who defaulted from treatment.
17298164:58	Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient information on the final status of these defaulters after the initial contact and advice to resume treatment.
17298164:59	Likewise, only one of 404 patients was reported to have treatment failure, which is unlikely with the current eight-month regimen used in this study setting . Nearly half of smear-positive TB patients do not have a follow-up sputum examination in this set-up , and as a result this reported failure rate is likely to be an underestimate.
17298164:60	In conclusion, defaulting from treatment in this study setting was high, and the main determinants appear to be factors related to physical access to a treatment centre.
17298164:61	The continuation phase of treatment is the most crucial time for defaulting from treatment, and future interventions should take this into consideration.

18700206:1	Introduction 
Olfaction is important in both human and animal mate choice (e.g. ; ).
18700206:2	One kind of information available from individual odours is an individual's genotype at the major histocompatibility complex, MHC.
18700206:3	Since discovery that mice prefer to mate with individuals of different MHC-congenic strains, and that this preference is mediated by chemosensory urinary cues, MHC-associated and apparently odour-mediated mating preferences have been demonstrated in several vertebrate taxa, including fish, reptiles and birds.
18700206:4	Mate preference for MHC-dissimilar individuals can be adaptive as it would increase offspring MHC heterozygosity, with beneficial influences on offspring viability through increased resistance to infectious disease or avoidance of inbreeding effects ( ; ).
18700206:5	MHC-correlated odour preferences have also been demonstrated in humans.
18700206:6	In a remarkable study, presented male axillary odours, collected on t-shirts worn overnight, to female sniffers.
18700206:7	Normally cycling women tested during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycles rated odours of MHC-dissimilar men as more pleasant than odours of MHC-similar men (see also ).
18700206:8	Additionally, odours of MHC-dissimilar men more often reminded women of current or previous partners, indicating that odour plays a role in partner choice.
18700206:9	Subsequent studies on women's preferences have found somewhat mixed results, ranging from similarly disassortative preferences or a preference for an intermediate level of dissimilarity to a null effect.
18700206:10	Studies of allele sharing in established partnerships also provide mixed results, with one finding disassortative mating, two finding no effect ( ; ) and one reporting assortative mating, although this result may be confounded by ethnicity.
18700206:11	Among real couples, self-reports suggest that women who share fewer alleles with their partner are more content in their relationship and less likely to seek extra-pair partnerships.
18700206:12	There is thus mixed support for a role of MHC in human partner choice and relationship stability.
18700206:13	Against this background, an ancillary result reported by deserves further investigation.
18700206:14	In contrast to MHC-dissimilar preferences in normally cycling women, pill users preferred odours of MHC-similar men, indicating that pill use might disrupt adaptive preference for dissimilarity.
18700206:15	Wedekind et al . speculated that this reflected a hormonally induced shift owing to the pregnancy-mimicking effect of the pill, leading to increased association with kin who could assist in childcare.
18700206:16	However, this shift could be costly if it results in choice of more MHC-similar partners: MHC similarity in couples may lead to increased risk of recurrent spontaneous abortion and longer interbirth intervals (review in ), and perhaps ultimately to partnership breakdown if odour perception plays a part in maintaining attraction to partners.
18700206:17	Here, we specifically test the possibility that pill use alters female preferences for male body odour.
18700206:18	paper has been criticized on the grounds that the pill-using group was relatively small (18, compared with 31 non-users).
18700206:19	Furthermore, because it was between-subjects in design, differences in MHC-correlated preferences could be due to underlying differences between pill-using and non-using women.
18700206:20	To address the second point in particular, we used a within-subjects experimental design, comparing preferences before and after initiating pill use.
18700206:21	Our design was based as far as possible on study, in which women rated odours of six men (three MHC similar and three MHC dissimilar), but each woman was tested twice, with an approximately 3-month interval.
18700206:22	In session 1, women were all tested in the late follicular phase of their cycle; our aim was that approximately half would initiate pill use shortly afterwards, while half would continue to cycle as normal.

4. Discussion 
Although several studies have reported significant effects of MHC dissimilarity on women's preferences for male body odour, we were unable to replicate this on our main sample of women, in which none were pill users and all were in the follicular cycle phase.
18700206:26	We based the design of our study on that of ; like them, (i) we tested preferences among three MHC-similar and three MHC-dissimilar odours, (ii) odours were captured on cotton t-shirts worn in bed, (iii) odour donors were asked to avoid potentially confounding environmental odours, (iv) menstrual cycle stage was controlled and so on.
18700206:27	However, there were nonetheless some methodological differences that could have accounted for the differences in the results.
18700206:28	Wedekind et al .'s women used nasal sprays to help their sense of smell, and read Su¨skind's novel Das Parfum to raise awareness of their smell perception.
18700206:29	Ours did neither of these, but these omissions are unlikely to be critical since other studies that omitted these requirements report significant effects of MHC on odour perception (e.g. ).
18700206:30	Although not specified in noted that odour donors had unshaven axillae and that odour collection occurred during the summer.
18700206:31	We did not collect information on axillary shaving (but few British men do so) and shirt wearing took place all-year round.
18700206:32	We did not use untreated cotton shirts (although shirts were washed with unperfumed detergent) and used halved rather than whole shirts, which may have reduced stimulus intensity.
18700206:33	We used glass jars rather than cardboard boxes to present the shirts, and capped these with aluminium rather than plastic foil, because glass can be washed and plastics absorb odours.
18700206:34	Finally, we asked women to briefly sniff all shirts before undertaking rating, which Wedekind et al . did not, because we felt this would allow women more consistent assessment of the shirts and reduce order effects.
18700206:35	While some further differences were introduced owing to our more complex experimental design, most were intended as improvements on design, although it remains possible they may have obscured women's ratings.
18700206:36	A more serious methodological difference was that, while Wedekind et al . (also ; ) presented freshly worn t-shirts to their smellers, we stored shirts in a freezer between collection and presentation.
18700206:37	However, Thornhill et al . found no significant preference related to MHC, suggesting that a null effect cannot solely be attributed to freezing.
18700206:38	Conversely, other odour studies using frozen samples have detected predicted and biologically meaningful effects, such as the relationships between odour and both facial attractiveness and bodily symmetry, ovulatory status effects on women's odour attractiveness, and of particular relevance here, the ability of human smellers to detect genetic relatedness through body odour and of a perfumer to describe MHC-associated odours (after freezing for more than 1 year: ).
18700206:39	Furthermore, while the predicted positive effect of MHC dissimilarity on ratings was not supported, we did detect other differences associated with pill use and relationship status, and ratings within and between test sessions were highly repeatable.
18700206:40	Our supplementary experiment using frozen t-shirts from the same men found no significant effect of freezing over 3 months on odour ratings or preference rank.
18700206:41	Thus, though it remains a possibility, we think it unlikely that frozen storage of samples (or other differences) were responsible for the null effect of MHC dissimilarity.
18700206:42	It is also possible that the null effect might have been due to the inclusion of men who were assessed under either the MHC-similar or MHC-dissimilar condition, but not in both.
18700206:43	For example, it could have been that those included only as MHC-similar men had especially attractive/weak odour, while those included only as MHC-dissimilar men had very unattractive/intense odours.
18700206:44	MHC studies should aspire to balance inclusion in either condition across the sample to avoid these non-MHC related effects.
18700206:45	In our study, logistical reasons led to 14 per cent of ratings relating to men who contributed in only one condition.
18700206:46	However, we found no evidence for systematic differences in odour pleasantness, desirability or intensity, suggesting that this was unlikely to be responsible for the null effect.
18700206:47	Furthermore, the effect of excluding these men's shirts from analyses was to reduce, rather than enhance, the difference between mean similar and mean dissimilar ratings.
18700206:48	Our data provide further evidence that use of oral contraceptives influence women's MHC-correlated odour preferences.
18700206:49	The significant session–group interaction, whereby ratings shift in favour of MHC similarity after initiating pill use, in contrast to the control group, is consistent with suggestion that pill use may disrupt adaptive mate preferences.
18700206:50	Indeed, our results are the first to test this suggestion empirically.
18700206:51	The slight change in the control group of non pill-users could arguably be interpreted in terms of increased experience in olfactory testing, eliciting a slightly stronger preference for MHC dissimilarity, but this was not matched by the pill group.
18700206:52	Although we had only one woman in our pill-using group who used a POP, excluding her from analysis improved the explanatory power of desirability ratings on change in odour preference.
18700206:53	We could therefore speculate that POP use may have less influence on this change than the combined pill, but this is based on only one woman and needs further testing.
18700206:54	At least two alternative explanations for the difference among groups of pill-using and non-using women could be proposed.
18700206:55	One is that the association between MHC-similarity preference and pill use is a by-product of increase in preference for MHC heterozygosity, since heterozygous men are on average more likely to share alleles with women raters (cf.
18700206:56	) and report greater preference for heterozygotes in the luteal phase.
18700206:57	However, our results indicated no difference in preferences for heterozygotes in either non-users or pill-users.
18700206:58	A second possibility, one which stimulated this study, is that there might be pre-existing behavioural differences between women who choose to use the pill and those who do not.
18700206:59	Indeed, we found that pill users used rating scales differently, awarding higher scores, on average, than non-users.
18700206:60	Importantly, this difference was apparent even before they initiated pill use, although we do not know the reason for this.
18700206:61	While absolutely higher ratings could not lead to the difference found by Wedekind et al ., it could potentially arise from a positive association between pill use and other attributes such as attractiveness or likelihood of being in a sexual relationship.
18700206:62	We found no evidence for an effect of attractiveness on preferences or pill use, but we did find an association between relationship status and MHC preference.
18700206:63	However, in direct contrast to what might be inferred from Wedekind et al .'s data, paired women showed higher preference for MHC dissimilarity while single women preferred MHC similarity.
18700206:64	This intriguing effect of relationship status is discussed further below, but it is worth noting that it may be at least partly responsible for the variability in findings across MHC-odour studies.
18700206:65	Our results therefore cannot, at face value, provide an explanation for the pill effect previously reported, but they do emphasize the way in which current circumstances can modulate preferences based on genetic similarity.
18700206:66	Mouse studies suggest that odour preference expression varies depending on reproductive status and behavioural context, since lactating female mice prefer to associate with MHC-similar females, presumably using odour, while females in oestrus prefer odours of MHC-dissimilar males (and other aspects of genetic quality involved in mate choice, ).
18700206:67	In our study, paired women expressed greater preferences for MHC dissimilarity in odours of unfamiliar men, and there was a non-significant association between fantasizing about extra-pair relationships and MHC-dissimilar odour preference.
18700206:68	Such expression of enhanced preference for dissimilarity might be interpreted within the context of desired attributes in extra-pair partners as a means to increase offspring heterozygosity, in common with similar preferences in birds (e.g. ; ), although it is curious that the effect was elicited most strongly in the long-term context question—perhaps this question focuses raters more successfully on desired mate choice characteristics than does rating of odour pleasantness.
18700206:69	It may also be that paired women can evaluate odours more accurately, and thus discriminate MHC dissimilarity more effectively, because they have more intimate recent experience of male odour (although we do not know why single women should have preferred MHC-similar men).
18700206:70	Similarly, women in established partnerships express clearer or different preferences for traits indicating additive genetic variance than single women, in both visual and olfactory modalities, but the extent to which these discrepancies ultimately reflect underlying strategic variation or differences in experience remains a question for further study.
18700206:71	We do not know whether the change in preferences related to pill use is sufficiently strong to influence partner choice, but it could do so if odour plays a significant role in actual human mate choice.
18700206:72	Some studies have suggested that women consider the olfactory domain to be an important factor in their assessment of potential partners (e.g. ).
18700206:73	Although we were unable to replicate the effect, demonstration of an association between MHC dissimilarity and the reminiscence of current or previous partners suggests that the influence of MHC-odour cues may extend beyond the laboratory.
18700206:74	If this is the case, our results indicate that use of the contraceptive pill could lead to choice of an otherwise less preferred partner.
17552106:0	The Study 
Clinical WNV patients, confirmed by immunoglobulin M ELISA and identified through local surveillance in the Houston metropolitan area from 2002 through 2004, were invited to participate in a study to determine long-term clinical sequelae.
17552106:1	Those consenting to participate were interviewed.
17552106:2	No patient was denied participation on the basis of age, sex, race, or ethnicity.
17552106:3	Excluded patients included those who were residing outside of the Houston area, deceased, or lost to follow-up.
17552106:4	This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Institutional Review Board (HSC-SPH-03–039).
17552106:5	Initial interviews were conducted after hospitalization, and follow-up interviews were conducted every 6 months until the patient reported being back to pre-WNV infection functioning.
17552106:6	For the 1-year follow-up, interviews were conducted during each December at the end of transmission season.
17552106:7	Interviews were mainly conducted over the telephone, but a small proportion were conducted in person.
17552106:8	In all of these interviews, a higher than expected proportion of patients reported depression immediately after their illness.
17552106:9	To better assess this quantitatively, we incorporated the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale into both initial and follow-up interviews.
17552106:10	This scale is a commonly used method for objective measurement of clinical depression.
17552106:11	The tool is composed of 20 questions focused on self-report of depressive moods and behavioral changes experienced by the patient during 1 week.
17552106:12	The resulting scores were interpreted as follows: 1) <15, the patient is not experiencing depression; 2) 15–21, the patient may be experiencing mild-to-moderate depression; 3) 22–60, the patient may be experiencing major depression.
17552106:13	In addition to the objective measurement using the CES-D scale, we also asked patients if they were experiencing depression since their illness and if they had a previous history of depression, with yes/no responses elicited.
17552106:14	Barthel Index scores were used to quantitatively evaluate level of physical functioning and disability in patients; a score of 100 points indicated no physical disability.
17552106:15	Because patients also commonly reported a change in personality immediately after WNV infection, we assessed this finding subjectively and asked those reporting a change to describe what they were experiencing.
17552106:16	Data were analyzed by using NCSS statistical software (Kaysville, UT, USA).
17552106:17	With the Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance on ranks, we analyzed CES-D scores and WNV outcome; CES-D scores and sex, age, and depression (CES-D score of 15); and physical functioning (Barthel Index) and depression.
17552106:18	A total of 65 patients were interviewed; 38 (58%) cases had encephalitis when initially evaluated, 19 (29%) had meningitis, and 8 (12%) had fever.
17552106:19	The mean age of patients was 55 years (range 12–86 years).
17552106:20	Most patients were white, non-Hispanic (80%), followed by black (11%) and white, Hispanic (9%).
17552106:21	One year after infection with WNV, 26 patients reported experiencing depression.
17552106:22	Of these, 6 reported a history of depression before infection.
17552106:23	Of the 20 patients considered to have new-onset depression, 13 (65%) had a clinical diagnosis of WNV encephalitis, and 10 (50%) were male.
17552106:24	The mean CES-D scores for those who reported no depression was 5.5 (range 0–19) compared with a mean score of 22 (range 0–44) for those who reported depression.
17552106:25	There was no statistical difference in CES-D scores between those who had encephalitis and those who had meningitis or fever (p = 0.19) or between those with West Nile neuroinvasive disease (encephalitis or meningitis) compared with those with fever (p = 0.55).
17552106:26	On the basis of CES-D scores for those self-reporting depression since their illness with WNV, 5 (25%) patients were classified by CES-D as not depressed, 6 (30%) were classified as having mild-to-moderate depression, and 9 (45%) were classified as having major depression.
17552106:27	Of the 39 patients who self-reported that they had not had depression since their WNV illness, 4 had a CES-D score of 15.
17552106:28	No statistically significant associations were found between loss of physical functioning (Barthel index scores <100; p = 0.39), sex (p = 0.89), or age (p = 0.47) and depression (CES-D scores of 15).
17552106:29	Seven (35%) patients reported taking antidepressants for their symptoms; 4 of these patients reported at least some improvement.
17552106:30	CES-D scores of 6 of these 7 patients were >15; 4 showed evidence of major depression.
17552106:31	Two patients reported seeing a counselor for depression, including 1 who was also taking antidepressants.
17552106:32	Both patients reported that the counseling was helpful; however, based on their CES-D scores, both were classified as having major depression at the time of the interview.
17552106:33	Personality changes were reported subjectively among 29 (45%) of the 65 patients; 18 (62%) of these were in patients who had encephalitis, and 16 (55%) of these patients were male.
17552106:34	When asked to describe their personality change, 19 patients (66%) reported an increase in anger (being short-tempered and irritable); 8 patients (28%) reported being less social; 3 patients (10%) reported increased sensitivity; and 1 patient (3%) reported feelings of hopelessness.
17552106:35	Conclusions 
Depression and personality changes after WNV infection have been briefly observed in previous studies; however, this study is the first known to objectively evaluate this outcome.
17552106:36	As evidenced by subjective and objective measurements, depression is an important outcome in patients with a clinical diagnosis of WNV infection: indeed, 75% of those reporting no previous history of depression had high CES-D scores.
17552106:37	Understanding the pathology of this outcome and determining whether the depression is situational (a result of prolonged recovery) or caused by chemical changes in the brain related to inflammation are critical.
17552106:38	Depression was not associated with loss of physical functioning, sex, or age.
17552106:39	Depression after encephalitis, regardless of etiology, is not uncommon.
17552106:40	Depression and personality changes in humans have been previously reported as a neuropsychiatric consequence of Lyme disease, Nipah virus, tickborne encephalitis virus, and Saint Louis encephalitis virus infections ( – ).
17552106:41	After the encephalitis lethargica pandemic from 1917 to 1926, depression, mania, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were observed in postencephalitis patients.
17552106:42	These observations led to the understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in mood, personality, and obsessional syndromes.
17552106:43	In a mouse model experiment, infection of the brain with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus resulted in a serotonin presynaptic deficit and postsynaptic hyperreactivity of the serotonin system.
17552106:44	Inflammation of the brain can result in an alteration in the neurotransmitter serotonin, which may lead to the development of mood disorders.
17552106:45	Capuron et al. identified a significant proportion of patients in whom depression developed after cytokine therapy for cancer.
17552106:46	The neurotoxic inflammation induced by cytokines resulted in decreased levels of tryptophan, the amino acid precursor for serotonin.
17552106:47	This decrease was positively correlated with the development and severity of depressive symptoms in patients.
17552106:48	The long-term clinical sequelae of WNV neuroinvasive disease need to be further defined.
17552106:49	By understanding potential outcomes and determining whether certain interventions such as physical therapy, counseling, and antidepressant drug therapy can improve recovery, we can better understand prognosis and potential treatment interventions.
17552106:50	Physicians should note that depression and personality changes could be important neuropsychiatric consequences in patients with clinical WNV infection.

The 15th Annual Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (CABM) symposium on structural genomics in pharmaceutical design gathered 20 keynote speakers, who presented the most recent advances in their structural genomics projects carried out in both academic institutions and companies
11864367:1	Here, we will give an overview of some of the most interesting talks.
11864367:2	High-throughput structural and functional genomics 
After recent successes in genome-sequencing projects, initiatives in structural genomics aim to understand fully the biological role of proteins by determining representative structures for protein families on a genomic scale.
11864367:3	Several investigators, including Stephen Burley (Rockefeller University, New York, USA), Andrzej Joachimiak (Argonne National Laboratories, USA), Gaetano Montelione (Rutgers University, Piscataway, USA and CABM), Wim Hol (University of Washington, Seattle, USA) and Sean Buchanan (Structural GenomiX Inc., San Diego, USA), talked about their ongoing structural genomic projects, most of which are funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).
11864367:4	Automation appears to be a critical factor for all of the large-scale structure determination projects discussed here, as protein-structure determinations traditionally rely on very labor-intensive methods of gene cloning, protein expression and purification, crystallization, and structure determination and refinement.
11864367:5	High-throughput protocols are now changing this aspect of structural biology.
11864367:6	Joachimiak described an automated protocol for data collection and structure determination.
11864367:7	Using the advanced photon source (APS), the third-generation synchrotron radiation facility, his group has made great advances in accelerating progress in structure determination.
11864367:8	The procedure they have automated includes: firstly, mounting crystals and adjusting positions on a beamline; secondly, collecting diffraction data; and thirdly, structure determination and refinement.
11864367:9	By following this protocol, most structures are solved to high resolution within a very short time period.
11864367:10	Hol described the on-going efforts in his lab towards structure-based drug-design, with a focus on drugs for diseases caused by tropical parasites.
11864367:11	He also reported the approval and funding of the latest NIH-sponsored structural genomics initiative, the Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa (SGPP); it will focus on microbial pathogens such as Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum, which cause sleeping sickness and malaria, respectively.
11864367:12	In contrast to the other structural genomics centers, SGPP selects potential targets on the basis of function, which should accelerate the determination of pathogenic protein structures for drug design.
11864367:13	As the central repository of protein structures, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) plays a critical role in structural genomics initiatives.
11864367:14	Helen Berman (Rutgers University, Piscataway, USA) described on-going developments at the PDB.
11864367:15	The database now includes more than 16,000 structures, and new entries are being added at a rate of 50-70 structures per week.
11864367:16	About 90% of the new entries are protein structures, and the average sizes of these structures have gradually increased over time.
11864367:17	One major improvement to the database is the automated processing of submissions to ensure uniformity in the data files and quality of the structures, and a future goal is to allow seamless deposition of data generated by structural genomics consortia.
11864367:18	Berman also mentioned the development of the Ligand Depot database; it contains information for about 250,000 small molecules, many of which are found in complexes in PDB structures.
11864367:19	Combined with the protein structure data in PDB, the Ligand Depot will be very useful for drug-design research in the future.
11864367:20	Predicting structure and function 
In addition to structure determination, structure prediction provides alternative ways to look at protein structures and understand the biological functions of proteins.
11864367:21	Jeff Skolnick (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, USA) described a novel unified method for structural prediction that combines in one the three most used methods - homology modeling, threading and ab initio prediction.
11864367:22	The unified method has the potential to predict active sites from ab initio models of protein structure, using a library of three-dimensional active-site descriptors.
11864367:23	Furthermore, this method has been extended to the problems of multimer threading (the prediction of protein complexes) and even the prediction of metabolic pathways.
11864367:24	Ming-Ming Zhou (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, USA) detailed progress in designing ligands for bromodomains, protein motifs involved in chromatin re-modeling and binding to acetylated histones.
11864367:25	A procedure for assessing the efficacy of drug binding on a large scale was presented by Ray Salemme (3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals Inc., Exton, USA): the change in melting temperature upon a ligand binding to a protein target was measured in a high-throughput screen.
11864367:26	Ronald Levy (Rutgers University, Piscataway, USA) then presented his laboratory's recent progress in ab initio tertiary structure prediction.
11864367:27	His work incorporates protein structural data to guide an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, using residual dipolar couplings (a method in nuclear magnetic resonance structure determination) to generate a model of the target protein backbone.
11864367:28	A key feature of this method involves searching the SCOP database with seven-residue subsets of the target protein, in order to find a set of dipolar couplings that most closely match each query fragment.
11864367:29	The predicted backbone is then assembled from candidate proteins according to their local fit to the dipolar coupling data.
11864367:30	Side-chain placement is accomplished using an energy-minimization routine to select optimal angles iteratively from a rotamer library, until the algorithm converges.
11864367:31	Because the prediction strategy makes use of experimental data to narrow the conformational search, there are opportunities to integrate this approach into high-throughput structural genomics efforts.
11864367:32	The role of bioinformatics in structural genomics 
In a field involving large quantities of biological data, bioinformatics provides important guidance for structural genomics projects, from target selection to data analysis.
11864367:33	Two bioinformatics talks given at the symposium are worthy of mention.
11864367:34	One was by M.G., who described the bioinformatics studies being conducted by our group, and in particular research on pseudogenes.
11864367:35	Although typically there are many pseudogenes in eukaryotic genomes, very little is known about them compared with the functional genes.
11864367:36	Research on pseudogenes investigates the occurrence of genes that have lost their function through the acquisition of a premature stop codon.
11864367:37	Combined with the recent development of a mathematical model that describes the process by which genomes evolved to their present state, the research provides a glimpse into the evolutionary history of the organism.
11864367:38	The second bioinformatics talk was by Cyrus Chothia (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK), who discussed several mechanisms of molecular evolution with respect to the observed repertoire of protein families.
11864367:39	A protein family is defined as a group of proteins that share a common evolutionary ancestor.
11864367:40	The recent sequencing of entire genomes enables researchers to identify the members of these families, and to reveal the biological processes that contributed to their divergence.
11864367:41	Two processes that appear to be instrumental in protein evolution are gene duplication and combination.
11864367:42	A goal of Chothia's work is the elucidation of relationships in sequence and structure between protein families in a genomic context, which is expected to shed light on the molecular basis of organismal evolution.
11864367:43	The role of structural genomics in pharmaceutical drug design 
Recent advances in structural genomics not only help us to understand protein functions but also have a big impact on the pharmaceutical industry.
11864367:44	In the last few years, the use of protein structural information in drug discovery research has matured, and it is now used at all levels, ranging from genomics-derived target identification and selection to the final design of suitable drug candidates.
11864367:45	An especially powerful methodology has arisen from the synergy of target structural information with combinatorial chemistry.
11864367:46	An excellent example of how structural genomics and combinatorial chemistry can be used in rational drug design was presented by Edward Arnold (Rutgers University, Piscataway, USA and CABM), who discussed the optimization of multiple factors in developing potent inhibitors for the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as potential drugs to prevent the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
11864367:47	HIV RT is vital for replication of the virus and is therefore rightly considered as a primary target for developing drugs.
11864367:48	On the basis of crystal structures of HIV RT and its ligand-bound forms, two primary types of target site were identified: the dNTP-binding site (used when RT carries out its polymerase function) and the non-nucleoside RT-inhibiting site.
11864367:49	Non-nucleoside RT-inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found to be especially suitable for disrupting HIV RT function.
11864367:50	NNRTI-targeted drugs should be chemically very diverse and should not compete with nucleotide-binding substrates, while inhibiting RT in nanomolar concentrations.
11864367:51	To identify the most potent NNRTI drugs, Arnold and colleagues used molecular modeling to calculate the interaction energy of a potential substrate bound at the non-nucleoside RT-inhibiting site, which consists of a hydrophobic pocket.
11864367:52	It turns out that the lower energy conformations usually produce the more potent drug.
11864367:53	Selected targets are synthesized and then assessed through antiviral screening experiments.
11864367:54	This procedure allowed faster design of a number of powerful NNRTI drugs.
11864367:55	The most successful candidates, such as TMC120 and TMC125, appear to have low toxicity (in the micromolar range) and high selectivity.
11864367:56	Monotherapy experiments with each of these produce up to 30-fold drop in the virus population in vitro.
11864367:57	There were many interesting talks in this symposium covering topics such as structural genomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and drug design methods.
11864367:58	Several NIH-funded structural genomics pilot projects have shown promising preliminary results in their first year of funding, with about 100 structures solved.
11864367:59	These projects will do even better in years to come and will accelerate the pace of structure determination, and are sure to have great impact on structural biology research and on drug design in the future.
17699948:0	Case Report 
Right eye phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation (IOL) (Acrylic foldable, AKREOSFIT, Bausch and Lomb, UK) and left eye unplanned extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and IOL implantation (PMMA, Domilens, France) were performed simultaneously on a 67-year-old man.
17699948:1	The indications for performing BSCS were bilateral significant cataract and patient′s desire to have both cataract surgeries performed at the same time.
17699948:2	Routine operating room protocol for prevention of intraocular infection was: preoperative sterilization of surgical instruments and some of the nondisposable drapes, eyelash isolation by means of adhesive drape and povidone iodine 10% preparation of the eyelid and face just before starting the surgery; intraoperative irrigation fluid of balanced salt solution, viscoelastic injection (2% hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, Cellugel, Alcon, Belgium) and subconjunctival injection of antibiotic (gentamicin 20 mg/0.5
17699948:3	ml) and steroid (dexamethasone 2 mg/0.5 ml) at the end of the operation; and postoperative patching of the eye for 24h followed by topical antibiotic drop (chloramphenicol every six hours) for three weeks and steroid (betamethasone every six hours) for four weeks.
17699948:4	No intraoperative complications occurred in either eye.
17699948:5	The surgeon did not change the surgical equipment in between the two eyes.
17699948:6	The surgeon had had the same protocol of BSCS for some patients without complication.
17699948:7	The patient developed pain and redness of both eyes associated with severe anterior chamber reaction (4 +) on the second postoperative day.
17699948:8	Intravitreal antibiotic (vancomycin 1mg/ 0.1ml + amikacin 0.4 mg/ 0.1 ml) was administered and antibiotic eye drops (vancomycin 50 mg/ ml + amikacin 15 mg/ ml) were started.
17699948:9	The patient did not improve and was referred to our hospital three days after the BSCS.
17699948:10	At the time of referral, eye examination showed a visual acuity of no light perception in the right and light perception without accurate projection in the left eye, severe corneal edema and severe fibrin exudates in the anterior chamber obscuring the iris, IOL and vitreous cavity in both eyes . Immediate vitrectomy procedure, IOL removal, intravitreal (vancomycin 1 mg/ 0.1 ml + amikacin 0. mg/ 0.1 ml) and subconjunctival antibiotic injection (gentamicin 20 mg/ 0.5 ml) was performed bilaterally under general anesthesia.
17699948:11	He also received systemic (ceftazidime 1g IV q 8h) and topical antibiotics.
17699948:12	Intravitreal culture showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The patient developed no light perception on both eyes a week after the operation.
17699948:13	Cultures from different parts of the operation room, surgical equipment and irrigation fluid were negative.
17699948:14	The surgical set culture showed negative result but it had been sterilized after the BSCS.
17699948:15	Discussion 
Bilateral intraocular surgery causes ongoing debate and perpetual disagreement among ophthalmologists.
17699948:16	Bilateral refractive error (over 2 diopters), medical, social or economic reasons and patient′s request are the main indications for a BSCS.
17699948:17	It has strongly been advised to consider the BSCS as two separate surgeries.
17699948:18	Presented case had BSCS for a social reason.
17699948:19	The surgeon, however, had not changed the equipment in between the two eyes.
17699948:20	Unilateral endophthalmitis after a BSCS, either ECCE or phacoemulsification, has previously been reported.
17699948:21	Ozdec et al. recently reported a case of bilateral endophthalmitis following a BSCS that finally developed functional vision on both eyes.
17699948:22	The present case resulted in no vision at the end.
17699948:23	There was another BSCS performed a day before the presenting case by the same surgeon who developed unilateral Pseudomonas aeruginosa was referred to another hospital and resulted in an evisceration.
17699948:24	A case of unilateral uncomplicated phacoemulsification was also performed on the same day as the presenting case, but with a different surgical set, without complication.
17699948:25	Pseudomonas endophthalmitis is associated with poor visual outcome despite prompt treatment.
17699948:26	Our patient lost vision in both eyes.
17699948:27	There are some reports of epidemic endophthalmitis after an uneventful unilateral cataract surgery.
17699948:28	Such a situation after BSCS will be devastating.
17699948:29	In conclusion, if BSCS is being performed, the surgeon needs to consider the other eye cataract surgery as a separate surgery and further needs to take care not only using separate instruments but also needs to scrub for the second time and change the cassette and phaco probe if performing phacoemulsification.
17699948:30	The surgeon needs to consider it as another cataract surgery.
10637273:0	Introduction 
Tuberculosis is a global health problem with enormous impact on human morbidity and mortality . Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and three million people die of active disease each year.
10637273:1	An essential virulence characteristic of M . tuberculosis is its ability to successfully parasitize monocytes and macrophages, despite the presence of multiple microbicidal mechanisms within these cells . The molecular mechanisms responsible for the intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis are unknown.
10637273:2	Multiple host–pathogen interactions may impact the fate of M . tuberculosis within human monocytes and macrophages and, consequently, the presence or absence of disease in infected individuals.
10637273:3	The earliest interaction between M . tuberculosis and mononuclear phagocytes is the binding and uptake of the bacilli by plasma membrane phagocytic receptors . Phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis in either the presence or absence of serum, is predominantly mediated by the complement receptor (CR)1, CR3, and CR4 . In human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), the β 2-integrin CR3 is the major phagocytic receptor for M . tuberculosis and anti-CR3 Abs inhibit ingestion of tubercle bacilli by ∼80% . In serum-free conditions, the macrophage mannose receptor also mediates mycobacterial phagocytosis, although its contribution to ingestion of M . tuberculosis is much less in the presence of complement proteins .
10637273:4	The ability of M . tuberculosis to enter macrophages via the CR-mediated phagocytic pathway may contribute to its intracellular survival, as, in many cases, CR ligation does not trigger phagocyte microbicidal responses . Studies with murine macrophages demonstrate that the class of phagocytic receptor that mediates ingestion of M . tuberculosis has a strong influence on the extent of phagosomal maturation.
10637273:5	CR-mediated phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis results in a phagosome that is unable to fuse with lysosomes . Conversely, if the bacillus is opsonized with M . tuberculosis –specific Abs, its ingestion is mediated by macrophage FcγRs, and the mycobacterial phagosome undergoes full maturation to a phagolysosome . These results suggest that FcγR-mediated ingestion of M . tuberculosis must mobilize signaling pathways that are distinct from those that are activated by CRs, which are responsible for the difference in phagosome maturation.
10637273:6	The relevance of these observations to human disease has been questioned, because the antimycobacterial activity of murine macrophages is much more easily demonstrated in vitro than that of human macrophages.
10637273:7	Although multiple investigators have demonstrated that CR-dependent ingestion of M . tuberculosis by human macrophages is also followed by defective phagosomal maturation to our knowledge, no data is available on the effects of Ab opsonization on survival of M . tuberculosis within human macrophages.
10637273:8	Furthermore, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for incomplete maturation of M . tuberculosis –containing phagosomes are unknown.
10637273:9	Many distinct signal transduction pathways contribute to the activation of phagocyte antimicrobial defenses, but their integrative function and relative priority in the killing of specific pathogens is unknown.
10637273:10	Stimulation-induced increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] c) are essential for activation of the phagocyte respiratory burst, production of nitric oxide, secretion of microbicidal granule constituents, and synthesis of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α .
10637273:11	Based on these considerations, three questions of specific relevance to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis were investigated in this study: (a) Does virulent M . tuberculosis alter Ca 2+-mediated signal transduction in human macrophages?
10637273:12	If so, (b) Do these alterations in macrophage Ca 2+ signaling contribute to incomplete phagosomal maturation and intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis and (c) Does the route of entry into human macrophages, i.e., via CR- versus FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, affect the intracellular viability of M . tuberculosis ? 
Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Macrophages possess multiple microbicidal mechanisms to eliminate phagocytosed microorganisms and, consequently, represent a strategic target for inactivation by potential pathogens . The molecular mechanisms that allow M . tuberculosis to successfully survive and replicate within mononuclear phagocytes are unknown.
10637273:13	Our overall hypothesis is that Ca 2+-dependent signaling mechanisms are potential targets for inhibition of macrophage activation by M . tuberculosis as [Ca 2+] c is a critical regulator of several antimicrobial responses, including generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, secretion of microbicidal proteins and peptides, and synthesis of antimycobacterial cytokines, such as TNF-α . 
This study demonstrates that multiple strains of pathogenic M . tuberculosis inhibit Ca 2+-mediated signal transduction during infection of human macrophages.
10637273:14	Inhibition of macrophage Ca 2+ signaling is tightly coupled to the failure of mycobacterial phagosomes to mature into acidic, microbicidal phagolysosomes and to successful intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis .
10637273:15	Two determinants of mycobacteria-induced inhibition of macrophage Ca 2+ signaling have been defined.
10637273:16	First, the bacilli must be viable, as killing of M . tuberculosis by heat or gamma irradiation reverses the inhibition of Ca 2+-mediated signal transduction.
10637273:17	Although the basis of this requirement is unknown, the dependence on mycobacterial viability has previously been demonstrated for the inhibition of P–L fusion in M . tuberculosis –infected human macrophages . Second, infection of macrophages in the absence of increased [Ca 2+] c is specific for phagocytosis via CRs.
10637273:18	Redirecting the phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis to FcγRs, via opsonization with specific polyclonal or monoclonal Abs, reverses mycobacteria-induced impairment of macrophage Ca 2+ signaling, and, more importantly, reduces the intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis within human MDMs.
10637273:19	The reduction in the intracellular survival of Ab-op bacilli was not due to a difference in phagocytosis, as both the phagocytic index (the number of bacilli ingested per macrophage) and the percentage of MDMs that phagocytosed at least one bacillus did not differ between the two groups.
10637273:20	Although mechanisms other than induction of elevated [Ca 2+] c may contribute to the decreased viability of Ab-op bacilli, direct evidence for a causal role of [Ca 2+] c in regulating the survival of M . tuberculosis within human macrophages was obtained with the calcium ionophore, A23187.
10637273:21	Thus, in this in vitro model of primary infection of human macrophages, the lack of an increase in [Ca 2+] c during CR-mediated phagocytosis correlated with inhibition of P–L fusion and increased intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis . Conversely, elevation of [Ca 2+] c was associated with increased P–L fusion and reduced intramacrophage viability.
10637273:22	The essential role of [Ca 2+] c in triggering multiple phagocyte antimicrobial defenses suggests that the inhibition of phagocytosis-initiated Ca 2+ signaling confers a survival advantage on M . tuberculosis at the time of its entry into macrophages.
10637273:23	Immunoelectron microscopy of M . tuberculosis –containing phagosomes supports the hypothesis that the bacilli's protected “intracellular niche” is established at a relatively early time point during infection of macrophages . The large number of Ca 2+-dependent biochemical reactions and cellular functions suggests that M . tuberculosis –induced inhibition of changes in [Ca 2+] c may compromise several components of macrophage activation and antimicrobial function.
10637273:24	The use of the term “inhibition” to characterize the lack of increase in [Ca 2+] c during phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis is meant in an operational sense, as the mechanism remains unknown.
10637273:25	Lack of initiation of a Ca 2+ signaling pathway or its rapid termination could both yield the observed results.
10637273:26	As CRs, especially CR3, are the primary mediators of phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis in human MDMs and because other C3b/bi-opsonized particles, including dead M . tuberculosis stimulate a rise in [Ca 2+] c, our working model is best summarized by the question, How does live M . tuberculosis inhibit CR-mediated increases in [Ca 2+] c?
10637273:27	Evidence in favor of this model, particularly the comparison between live and dead C-op M . tuberculosis as a means to understand the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, include: (a) live and dead C-op M . tuberculosis are phagocytosed to the same extent by human MDMs (b) the extent of phagocytosis of live and dead M . tuberculosis is inhibited to the same extent by anti-CR3 Abs (c) the level of C3 deposition does not differ between live and heat-killed bacilli (data not shown), and (d) anti-CD18 F(ab′) 2 fragments eliminate the increase in [Ca 2+] c stimulated by dead M . tuberculosis or COZ.
10637273:28	This model encompasses the possibility that additional interactions between live M . tuberculosis and human MDMs other than ligation of mycobacterial surface-bound C3b/bi by CRs may contribute to the inhibition of Ca 2+ signaling.
10637273:29	As the fluorescent detection of [Ca 2+] c is highly sensitive, our hypothesis is that no Ca 2+ signal is initiated during phagocytosis of live M . tuberculosis .
10637273:30	However, the biochemical signals that normally link CRs to increases in [Ca 2+] c are unknown, and, therefore, we cannot ascertain whether these intermediate steps are “not initiated” or “initiated but inhibited.”
10637273:31	These mechanistic uncertainties are an additional reason that we have used the more general phrase, “inhibition of Ca 2+ signaling.”
10637273:32	However, we recognize that further definition of the mechanism(s) by which CR-induced phagocytosis of C-op M . tuberculosis occurs in the absence of a change in macrophage [Ca 2+] c may necessitate a revision of our current model and terminology.
10637273:33	Comparison of our results with those recently reported by Majeed et al. illustrates both the similarities and differences in the interactions of M . tuberculosis with mononuclear phagocytes versus neutrophils (PMNs).
10637273:34	Although neutrophil ingestion of the attenuated H37Ra strain of M . tuberculosis also occurred in the absence of a rise in [Ca 2+] c, PMNs killed 73% of phagocytosed tubercle bacilli in 2 h . Whether induction of a rise in Ca 2+ via physiologic or pharmacologic intervention would augment PMN P–L fusion or bactericidal activity toward M . tuberculosis was not reported, and no virulent strains of M . tuberculosis were used . Furthermore, M . tuberculosis does not successfully parasitize human neutrophils, and several studies have demonstrated that PMNs kill intracellular M . tuberculosis by both oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms .
10637273:35	Finally, caution is required in comparing Ca 2+-mediated signal transduction of neutrophils with that of macrophages, as these two classes of phagocytes have been reported to differ in the Ca 2+ dependence of antimicrobial functions . 
Zimmerli et al. have reported that human macrophages do not require an increase in [Ca 2+] c for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes containing COZ, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or the vaccine strain M . bovis BCG . The differences between their results and ours may be due, at least in part, to differences in both the methods of measuring phagosomal maturation and the characteristics of the phagocytosed particles.
10637273:36	Zimmerli et al. used colocalization of the particles with LAMP-1 and endocytosed rhodamine dextran to define maturation of phagolysosomes.
10637273:37	However, neither LAMP-1 nor dextran localize specifically to lysosomes, as both markers label late endosomes as well . Perhaps the Ca 2+ requirement for P–L fusion is influenced by characteristics of the particle, e.g., its virulence; M . tuberculosis is a highly virulent intracellular pathogen, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci are extracellular pathogens of low virulence, BCG is nonpathogenic, and zymosan is a cell wall preparation from the nonpathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
10637273:38	Finally, the lack of statistically significant differences in P–L fusion between control and Ca 2+-buffered MDMs in their study may have been influenced by the small sample size, as the average decrease in P–L fusion in MAPTAM-treated MDMs compared with control MDMs was as great as 23%, and the standard deviations ranged from 30 to 100% of the mean values.
10637273:39	Further studies will be required to clarify the variables that affect the Ca 2+ dependence of phagosomal maturation in human macrophages.
10637273:40	A fascinating aspect of M . tuberculosis –induced inhibition of Ca 2+ signaling is its particle specificity during concurrent or subsequent addition of a Ca 2+-mobilizing stimulus.
10637273:41	Although MDMs did not generate an increase in [Ca 2+] c during infection by live, C-op bacilli, these same cells maintained the capacity to respond to other phagocytosed particles (COZ, killed or Ab-op M . tuberculosis ) or soluble stimuli (PAF) by increasing their levels of [Ca 2+] c.
10637273:42	Therefore, viable, C-op M . tuberculosis does not introduce a generalized defect in the Ca 2+ signaling pathways of human MDMs.
10637273:43	These results suggest that CR-induced increases in [Ca 2+] c are spatially restricted to each specific phagocytic event, i.e., each forming phagosome, although further studies will be required to directly test this hypothesis.
10637273:44	This proposed focal nature of phagocytosis-associated Ca 2+ signaling or, in the case of M . tuberculosis the lack thereof, is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the tightly regulated spatial constraints of Ca 2+-mediated signal transduction . In fact, Stendahl et al. have recently demonstrated that during phagocytosis of COZ, [Ca 2+] c levels are highest in the periphagosomal region . 
Whereas our data demonstrating increased P–L fusion after Ab opsonization of M . tuberculosis are in agreement with those of Armstrong and Hart our studies differ with respect to the consequences for mycobacterial survival.
10637273:45	In this study, opsonization of M . tuberculosis with specific monoclonal or polyclonal Abs resulted in significant decreases in intracellular viability within human macrophages.
10637273:46	In contrast, Armstrong and Hart demonstrated that survival within murine macrophages was similar for serum- and Ab-op M . tuberculosis . As numerous investigators have documented significant differences between the tuberculocidal capacities of human versus murine macrophages (for review see references 3, 6, 46–48), we hypothesize that this species specificity is a major factor contributing to the contrasting effects of Ab opsonization on mycobacterial survival noted in our two studies.
10637273:47	Zimmerli et al. recently demonstrated that Ab-mediated inhibition of individual CRs or the mannose receptor did not alter the intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis within human MDMs . This study differs from ours in two respects.
10637273:48	First, the effect of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis on mycobacterial survival was not determined, and second, receptor-blocking reagents were used to direct phagocytosis of M . tuberculosis to unblocked receptor . However, blocking reagents may introduce confounding effects by stimulating the receptors to which they bind, and it is often difficult to block multiple receptor classes ligated by complex particles, such as M . tuberculosis . In contrast, opsonization of M . tuberculosis with specific ligands provides a direct, physiologically relevant analysis of the impact of individual receptor classes on the intracellular survival of M . tuberculosis .
10637273:49	The lack of Ca 2+ mobilization during ingestion of M . tuberculosis may represent an important mechanism of immune evasion that contributes to its survival within human macrophages.
10637273:50	As the specific mechanism(s) by which human macrophages kill intracellular M . tuberculosis is unknown, it is difficult at present to define the means by which inhibition of Ca 2+ signaling promotes mycobacterial survival, although inhibition of P–L fusion is likely to contribute.
10637273:51	Despite these challenges, characterization of the molecular mechanisms responsible for M . tuberculosis –induced alterations in macrophage Ca 2+ signaling and its specific contribution to intracellular survival will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and may contribute to the development of novel therapies to treat this formidable disease.

15980547:0	INTRODUCTION 
The appearance of next generation micro-array technologies, with emphasis on high-density, low cost custom oligonucleotide-arrays, such as the NimbleExpress (Affymetrix, CA), together with the increasing number of sequenced genomes, opens up a new world of opportunities for the biologist.
15980547:1	Using customized arrays it now becomes feasible to do different types of experiments, e.g. expression analysis of exciting newly sequenced organisms, special purpose studies, such as alternative splicing, mapping of untranslated regions (UTRs) and screening intergenic regions for novel transcripts.
15980547:2	In order to fully exploit the potential of these advances, it is crucial to have access to probe design tools that provide the required flexibility to design probes for this wide range of purposes.
15980547:3	Such a tool should also provide a good overview of the different aspects of probe design, e.g. probe quality parameters, the placement along the target transcripts and must also aid in identifying high quality probes.
15980547:4	OligoWiz 1.0 has since its release two years ago showed its strength as a very flexible probe design tool.
15980547:5	The scoring scheme for probes, the flexible weighting system and the availability of a range of genome databases, have made OligoWiz 1.0 popular for the design of custom oligonucleotide-arrays.
15980547:6	Currently, ∼50 000 genes are submitted to the OligoWiz 1.0 server every month.
15980547:7	However, OligoWiz 1.0 is primarily build for selecting one single long probe (50–70 bp) per gene, aimed at traditional gene expression analysis.
15980547:8	The valuable feedback we have received from the users of OligoWiz 1.0, as well as our own experience suggested that there was a demand for an expansion that could automate the selection of multiple probes per transcript.
15980547:9	Also, the effort of designing special purpose microarrays is in our experience a tedious and demanding task.
15980547:10	Therefore, we have integrated the ability to work with sequence feature annotation directly into OligoWiz 2.0, as part of the scheme for automatic placement of multiple probes.
15980547:11	The advanced rule-based selection of probes is one of the most important new features in OligoWiz 2.0.
15980547:12	A small number of general-purpose programs for microarray oligonucleotide probe selection have been published ( – ).
15980547:13	These programs, much like OligoWiz 1.0, feature some kind of quality assessment of the probes available for detecting a transcript.
15980547:14	Typically through detection of possible cross-hybridization and some physical/chemical properties of the probes, like melting temperature of the probe:target bond.
15980547:15	In addition, some programs estimate the folding potential of the probes using mfold ( – ).
15980547:16	Furthermore, a number of special purpose probe designs have been reported without providing a general method ( – ).
15980547:17	Only one of the available programs describe standard protocol for placing multiple probes within each transcript and no program is available for placing probes relative to sequence annotation, such as exon/intron structure, UTRs, transcription start site, etc.
15980547:18	Since one of the goals of OligoWiz is to encourage the user to experiment with the array design, it has always been the aim of OligoWiz 2.0 to deliver the result in a reasonably short time scale—for example, the processing of the ∼5600 transcripts in the Yeast genome takes ∼45–60 min, depending on the server load.
15980547:19	QUICK REVIEW: SCORING SCHEME 
OligoWiz 2.0 utilizes a set of scores each describing how well suited each possible probe, along the transcript sequences is for use as a DNA microarray probe, according to the following criteria: Cross-hyb, Delta-Tm, Low-complexity, Position and Folding.
15980547:20	Each score has a value between 0.0 (not suited) and 1.0 (well suited).
15980547:21	All of these scores are combined using a weighting scheme to form a Total score for each possible probe.
15980547:22	The Total score is used for selecting the best-suited probe(s).
15980547:23	A comprehensive description of the algorithms used for calculating the scores—Cross-hybridization (previously ‘Homology’), Δ T m and Low-complexity is found in the OligoWiz 1.0 paper.
15980547:24	The following changes in the probe scoring scheme have been introduced since OligoWiz 1.0:
 
 
FOLDING SCORE 
To estimate to what extent the probes are available for hybridization with the target, the self-annealing ability must be estimated.
15980547:25	For probes that are attached to the array support in one end, this is equal to a probe folding prediction.
15980547:26	The main reason for not including a score for folding (self-annealing) in OligoWiz 1.0 was the overwhelming computational burden of secondary structure calculation using programs, such as mfold ( – ).
15980547:27	Therefore an alternative and faster algorithm to estimate the folding energy, utilizing the overlapping nature of consecutive probes along a transcript, was developed.
15980547:28	Initially the full transcript sequence is translated into a 16-letter alphabet representing the dinucleotides.
15980547:29	Then a super-alignment matrix covering the whole transcript is built, using stacking energies for the dinucleotides as substitution scores.
15980547:30	To gain speed a hash entry for each of the 16 possibly dinucleotides, containing an alignment row in the super-alignment matrix, were used to fill the respective rows of the super-alignment matrix.
15980547:31	Subsets of the super-alignment matrix were then used to calculate the folding of the consecutive probes along the length of the transcript, by dynamic programming (local alignment) ( triangles).
15980547:32	The dynamic programming algorithm is allowed to utilize the path graph of the previously calculated probe, which limits the required calculations to include a few new rows in the new path graph and thereby speeds up the calculation significantly.
15980547:33	The algorithm allows gaps and summation of multiple independent folds with folding energy less than −4 kcal/mol to return an overall folding energy.
15980547:34	This simple algorithm estimates folding energies for subsequences (potential probes) along an input sequence 500–1000 times faster than nafold [the core program of mfold], resulting in a time consumption of ∼1.5 s for all 25 bp subsequences of a 1000 bp input sequence, when run on the OligoWiz 2.0 server.
15980547:35	To evaluate the precision of the folding algorithm, the estimated folding energy for all 25 bp subsequences of three Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcripts (acc: YOR084W, YDL144C and YFR018C, of 1071, 1164 and 1092 bp respectively) was compared with mfold estimations.
15980547:36	The two folding energy estimates are plotted against each other in .
15980547:37	The two estimates have an overall Pearson correlation of 0.89 and for subsequences, estimated to have a folding energy lower than −6 kcal/mol, the correlation is 0.986.
15980547:38	For the OligoWiz 2.0 server the folding energy is converted into a ‘Fold score’ that ranges from 1 to 0, where 1 is ‘no significant folding’, and 0 is ‘strong folding’.
15980547:39	where F is the free energy of the folding (kcal/mol), L is the probe length and k is a constant (default 20).
15980547:40	INTEGRATING SEQUENCE FEATURES INTO THE PROBE DESIGN 
In order to place probes relative to sequence features, such as intron/exon structure, the user has the option of supplying a sequence feature annotation string along with each input sequence.
15980547:41	The annotation string consists of a single-letter annotation code, one letter for each position in the input sequences.
15980547:42	As an example we use the letter ‘E’ to annotate nucleotides which are part of an exon and the letter ‘I’ for those, which are part of an intron in some of the example datasets available at the OligoWiz 2.0 website, . 
A combined sequence and annotation file can easily be custom made or extracted from GenBank files using the FeatureExtract server (URL: ), which was build for this purpose.
15980547:43	The file format is described in detail at the OligoWiz 2.0 website.
15980547:44	The sequence feature annotation is visualized in the graphical interface.
15980547:45	Combined with the rule-based placement of probe described in the next section, this enables the scientist to apply different placement strategies and immediately inspect the placement in the context of the graphical representation.
15980547:46	RULE-BASED PLACEMENT OF PROBES 
We have implemented a rule-based method of probe placement that builds upon the existing scheme of parameter scores.
15980547:47	The rationale behind this approach is to make it possible (i) to place multiple probes within each transcript according to the desired distance criteria and (ii) to take sequence annotation into account.
15980547:48	For each sequence, the steps in the probe placement algorithm are as follows:
 
The search can be restricted to sub-sets of the input sequence of interest, by defining a set of conditions that must be present and/or absent in the sequence feature annotation or the transcript sequence itself.
15980547:49	These conditions are defined with regular expressions (advanced text-based matching), which are used to create a filter that defines the sub-set of the transcript that will be considered during the iterative probe placement.
15980547:50	Detailed instructions on how to take advantage of sequence feature annotation in combination with rule-based placement of probes can be found on the OligoWiz 2.0 website.
15980547:51	CONSISTENT HYBRIDIZATION 
Evaluating a probe design is not an easy task and furthermore it is often considered too costly.
15980547:52	Here, we decided to evaluate the OligoWiz 2.0 probe design by designing 7–8 probes of 24–26 bp for each of 3278 Aspergillus nidulans genes.
15980547:53	3278 correspond to the most well annotated genes of A.nidulans (annotated by the Broad Institute).
15980547:54	A microarray containing these probes was synthesized in situ on a geniom one microarray system [Febit, Manheim, Germany].
15980547:55	Labeled aRNA from 12 independently grown A.nidulans samples were hybridized onto the array.
15980547:56	The Pearson correlation between the probe intensity measures and the gene expression index through the 12 samples were used as a measure of probe consistency.
15980547:57	The average probe correlation to the expression profile was 0.85.
15980547:58	This correlation showed clear intensity dependence, with high correlation for significantly expressed genes and less correlation for genes expressed close to the background level.
15980547:59	A very conservative interpretation of these results is that the probes designed by OligoWiz 2.0 give internally consistent signals.
20856806:0	Introduction 
Inflammation is highly related to both carcinogenesis and to progression of tumor growth . Epidemiological studies show that chronic inflammation predisposes patients to cancer development and long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of several cancers . 
Cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and -2) are rate-limiting enzymes in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid.
20856806:1	COX-1 expression is generally constitutive, while COX-2 is usually induced by stimuli involved in inflammatory responses.
20856806:2	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a primary metabolite of COX-2, has been shown to promote cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis and inhibit apoptosis and antitumor immune response, all processes promoting cancer development . 
Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with very limited options for treatment.
20856806:3	Chronic pancreatitis predisposes individuals to developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and pancreatic tumor stroma is characterized by the variety of inflammatory cells suggesting the involvement of inflammatory processes in this cancer.
20856806:4	COX-2 is overexpressed in approximately 75% of human carcinomas including those of the pancreas.
20856806:5	Recent studies in transgenic mice , have shown that COX-2 overexpression in the exocrine pancreas induced pancreatitis-like-state.
20856806:6	The onset of the cancer in these mice was prevented by maintaining mice on selective COX-2 inhibitors, further demonstrating the important role of inflammation on pancreatic cancer development.
20856806:7	Human trials to prevent colon cancer were recently conducted using COX-2 inhibitors.
20856806:8	Despite encouraging results in colon cancer prevention and reduction in the incidence of colon adenomas, NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors can cause serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects and therefore are not routinely recommended for these diseases . 
Diclofenac, one of the oldest NSAIDs has been in use since 1976.
20856806:9	Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenases non-selectively.
20856806:10	Studies in humans demonstrated that it reduces 94% of COX-2 and 49% of COX-1 activity . In vitro it potently inhibits phospholipase A2 (PLA2) the enzyme which liberates arachidonic acid and lysophospholipid to generate a family of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (including PGE2) and platelet activating factor.
20856806:11	Additional evidence suggests that diclofenac also inhibits PLA2 in vivo . PLA2 is believed to play a key role in the first steps of the inflammatory cascade leading to acute pancreatitis .
20856806:12	The initial study followed by several other groups, has shown that diclofenac can significantly decrease the rate of acute pancreatitis caused by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
20856806:13	In light of diclofenac ability to inhibit potently both COX-2 and PLA2 we have explored its anticancer potential in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer.
20856806:14	Here we report that diclofenac treatment causes a 60% decrease in tumor size.
20856806:15	This is due to increased apoptosis of tumor cells.
20856806:16	We provide evidence that this effect is indirect and operates through at least two mechanisms.
20856806:17	First, diclofenac yields a significant antiangiogenic effect, as demonstrated by a strong reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tumor content, decreased microvascular density and morphological changes in tumor blood vessels.
20856806:18	Second, diclofenac treatment remarkably increases arginase activity in tumor stroma cells, peritoneal macrophages and white blood cells.
20856806:19	This is an unexpected finding since COX-2 inhibitors were shown to reduce tumor growth through arginase inhibition Our results are in line with earlier studies, which point to antitumoral and antiangiogenic effect of arginine depletion and support the rather controversial approach of anticancer treatment by enhancing arginase activity . 
Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In this study we have examined the antitumor potential of diclofenac in an orthotopic model of mouse pancreatic cancer.
20856806:20	PANC02 cells injected into the tail of the pancreas rapidly multiplied, formed large local tumors and repeatedly metastasized primarily to the cut in the abdomen performed for inoculation.
20856806:21	The tendency of tumor cells to implant into a wound is a concern in cancer surgery and has been studied in animal models . The pro-tumor factors secreted by wounds may be responsible for this phenomenon.
20856806:22	Diclofenac treatment caused a significant decrease in the tumor weight at the primary site of injection.
20856806:23	This decrease was due to enhanced apoptosis of cancer cells.
20856806:24	The anti-tumoral capacity of diclofenac is generally attributed to its direct effect on tumor cell viability and cell cycle . However this effect is obtained only using very high concentrations of drug in vitro (up to 800 µM).
20856806:25	This may not reflect the in vivo situation except for topical administration of the drug . 
In our model, the effect on PANC02 growth rate could not be reproduced in vitro when cells were incubated either in the presence of 10 µM diclofenac, the higher range of C max values of the drug reported in human and mice studies, or in the presence of 50 µM of the drug.
20856806:26	This prompted us to test the activity of diclofenac on other tumor growth promoting components.
20856806:27	Antiangiogenic activity of diclofenac was suggested in a model of subcutaneous implanted colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells, where the drug was topically applicated . Our study further demonstrates the antiangiogenic potential of diclofenac in intra abdominal tumors.
20856806:28	We found, that after 11-day treatment, diclofenac caused a significant decrease in blood content of tumors as illustrated by their pale appearance, decrease in blood vessels count and smooth muscle actin content ( and ).
20856806:29	VEGF has been shown to be the main angiogenic factor in tumor vascularization.
20856806:30	Therefore we measured VEGF protein levels both in the tumor and in the peritoneum and found a pronounced decrease in diclofenac treated animals.
20856806:31	The decrease in VEGF content in tumors of diclofenac treated mice may be due to a decrease in VEGF expression in tumor cells, in stroma cells, or in both types of cells.
20856806:32	The decrease in the peritoneal cavity can be due to the change in VEGF content of tumor or to the direct effect of diclofenac on peritoneal mesothelial cell lining.
20856806:33	Additional studies are required to resolve this issue.
20856806:34	The effect of diclofenac on VEGF production could not be recapitulated in vitro when cultured PANC02 or peritoneal macrophages were incubated with diclofenac.
20856806:35	Previously, diclofenac has been reported to decrease mRNA-VEGF levels via COX inhibition in cultured esophageal cancer cell lines . In our in vivo model it is thus likely that the direct effect of diclofenac on VEGF production leads to an antiangiogenic effect which in turn affects apoptosis of cancer cells in the growing tumor.
20856806:36	We have also tested the possibility that diclofenac may directly affect vascular cells.
20856806:37	While diclofenac was unable to induce pro-apoptotic and anti-VEGF effect on cultured PANC02, its antiangiogenic effect could be demonstrated ex vivo.
20856806:38	When 10 µM diclofenac was incubated together with rat aortic rings, it yielded a pronounced inhibition of sprouting.
20856806:39	This suggests that diclofenac can directly inhibit the development of endothelial/smooth muscle cells.
20856806:40	Interestingly, we have found that peritoneal concentration of VEGF is significantly higher than that of the serum, both in tumor-free and in tumor-bearing mice.
20856806:41	Assuming that the volume of the peritoneal fluid is about 100 µl our results demonstrate that the VEGF concentration amounts to about 340 pg/ml in sham-operated-tumor-free mice and to above 4000 pg/ml in tumor-bearing mice.
20856806:42	The high concentration of VEGF in the peritoneal cavity does not equilibrate with the blood compartment and is 4 and 55 fold higher (as compared with serum values) in sham-operated and tumor-bearing mice, respectively.
20856806:43	In healthy pigs it was also shown that the intra peritoneal VEGF does not equilibrate with the serum.
20856806:44	Our results, as well as study challenge the notion that systemic VEGF levels can predict tumor load.
20856806:45	Furthermore it may be interesting to explore the possibility of delivering antiangiogenic antibodies for intra abdominal tumors directly into the peritoneal cavity and not systemically.
20856806:46	Unlike the clear antineoplastic effect of diclofenac through inhibition of angiogenesis, the striking activation of arginase activity, both in tumor stroma and in peritoneal macrophages is difficult to assess in context of pro- or anti-cancer activity.
20856806:47	One study noted that high arginase activity found in myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSC), was associated with immunosuppressive activity and tumor-promotion . The authors proposed that high COX-2 activity of tumor cells releases PGE2, which activates arginase in MDSC and leads to extracellular arginine depletion and subsequent T-cell dysfunction.
20856806:48	Along with these results, two additional studies have shown that treatment of tumor bearing mice with COX-2 specific inhibitors completely blocked the induction of arginase activity, reduced MDSC accumulation and decreased tumor growth.
20856806:49	However, there is evidence that tumor cells are particularly sensitive to arginine depletion and that enhanced arginase activity can restrict tumor growth and . Furthermore it has been shown that dietary arginine restriction caused a significant reduction in both tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity in a mouse papilloma cancer model . 
To our knowledge we are the first to show that diclofenac causes pronounced arginase activation in tumor stroma CX3CR1 + cells, in peritoneal macrophages and in WBC.
20856806:50	This activation correlates with a significant inhibition of tumor growth.
20856806:51	Further research is needed in order to determine if this correlation is causative or coincidental.
21687703:0	Introduction 
Colon cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American adults.
21687703:1	The incidence of this disease in African Americans (AA) is higher than in the general population , . African Americans are also more likely to die from colon cancer than others.
21687703:2	There are different participating factors in colon carcinogenesis.
21687703:3	Genetic factors impact gene or genome structures and integrity while epigenetic parameters have an effect on DNA structure and expression , while environmental factors such as diet and its interaction with the gut flora impacts the colon mucosa through the metabolic products' effects on colon tissue homeostasis.
21687703:4	The metabolic byproducts are channeled through the colon mucosa by a set of genes of which the primary function is molecules' transport.
21687703:5	The SLC gene family encodes a group of proteins that are involved in such transport through cell membranes.
21687703:6	Mutations or lack of expression of these genes have been implicated in many disorders . SLC5A8, also called SMCT for sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, is a member of the SLC gene family and have been extensively studied.
21687703:7	This gene is expressed in the retina, brain, kidney, thyroid and in the gastrointestinal system , , .
21687703:8	It has been shown that the SLC5A8 protein sit within the apical membrane of the intestinal tract where it is involved in the absorption of short chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate) into the colon . Butyrate, a byproduct of bacterial fermentation, has been proven to have anti-proliferative characteristics.
21687703:9	As such, SLC5A8 gene product that is involved in its transport through the colon mucosa have been labeled as a tumor suppressor gene .
21687703:10	It has also been shown that butyrate impacts cell proliferation through its effect on histones acetylation status.
21687703:11	Histone modification is very instrumental in the expression level of genes within the cell.
21687703:12	Consequently, butyrate transport by SLC5A8 gene product impacts the expression level of many genes that are likely involved in the negative control, anti-proliferative, of the cell cycle within the colon mucosa .
21687703:13	This gene's involvement in cancer has already been highlighted in many studies.
21687703:14	Indeed, Park et al have already shown that both pancreatic and prostate cancers display an SLC5A8 methylation level of 70% unlike in the adjacent non-tumor tissues . 
A similar situation was reported by Bennett et al. in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients .
21687703:15	Using a Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning technique, they found five methylation markers among which SLC5A8 gene.
21687703:16	The other genes were SEPT9, FUSSEL18, EBF3 and IRX1 . While studying posttranslational histones modifications in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), Whitman et al., (2008) found that such modifications are generally associated with a hypermethylation profile in which SLC5A8 gene plays a central role . 
A recent study by Thangaraju et al (2008) have shown that SLC5A8 is silenced in humans, in cell lines and in a mouse model of colon cancer . Their findings strengthen earlier results by Li et al . They also proved that the re-expression of SLC5A8 in colon cancer cell lines in the presence of butyrate leads to apoptosis through the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of proliferative genes . 
Most of the studies on SLC5A8 were done on cancer samples and none has checked in adenomas.
21687703:17	As such, we here propose to analyze the methylation status of SLC5A8 gene in African American colon adenomas with the goal of finding early colon cancer markers in this group of patients to mitigate the high incidence of the disease in this group.
21687703:18	Histones expression profiles was assessed using a proteomic analysis.
21687703:19	Microsatellite instability, also an early event, was studied and data from both analysis were compared.
21687703:20	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Earlier studies have checked the methylation status of SLC5A8 gene in many cancerous tissue and cell lines: prostate, head and neck, pancreas, colon and blood.
21687703:21	All of these studies have pointed to a high methylation level of this gene among others , , . SLC genes are known to be involved in the transport of many solutes that differ from one gene to another and for the same gene from one organ to the other SLC5A8 gene is involved in the transport of butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, all of which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases . SLC5A8 acts on colon tissue homeostasis mainly through its transport of butyrate, a byproduct of gut flora metabolism.
21687703:22	Indeed, in colon cancer cell lines that were demethylated by 5-aza-cytidine, an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes was noticed only if butyrate was supplemented in the medium . 
In this study, we established the methylation status of SLC5A8 in colon adenomas in African Americans, a population at high risk of developing colon cancer.
21687703:23	Our finding that 82% of samples were methylated strengthen earlier findings in cancerous samples and point to the early occurrence of this methylation in the carcinogenic process.
21687703:24	Our recent CpG islands microarray analysis of different types of adenomas further confirmed our findings . In these microarray studies, SLC5A8 gene came out always methylated.
21687703:25	The MSI analysis have displayed an 18% MSI-H rate that is similar to the one obtained with a study of 222 AA colon carcinomas that showed 19.8% MSI-H . As such both microsatellite instability and SLC5A8 methylation occur very early in colon tumorigenesis.
21687703:26	However, since not all tumors are initiated as a result of DNA MMR defects in expression or sequence, microsatellite instability phenotype would only define a small subset of tumors (∼20%).
21687703:27	The co-occurrence of SLC5A8 methylation and the MSI phenotype in our samples might also point to the fact that both result from the same methylation event since the MSI phenotype is generally caused by an epigenetic silencing of DNA mismatch repair genes.
21687703:28	Within the MSI-H group, 22% were not methylated for SLC5A8, also 83% SLC5A8 methylated samples were non-MSI-H.
21687703:29	These data reflects that there is some level of specificity during the DNA methylation process.
21687703:30	Indeed, our statistical analysis has clearly shown that there was no association between SLC5A8 methylation and the MSI phenotype.
21687703:31	DNA methylation is known to be part of the aging process.
21687703:32	Our data with SLCA8 methylation seems to be non-age specific.
21687703:33	Many of the patients in this study were not very old and the difference in age between the groups SLC5A8 methylated vs. unmethylated was not statistically significant.
21687703:34	Consequently the high level methylation observed in this study is likely linked to the tumorigenic process.
21687703:35	It is noteworthy that the mean age of our group of patients (62.5 years) is in agreement with the data obtained with our large scale study of 222 colon carcinoma in AAs . There was 44% of patients in this study who were over 60 years while Kumar et al (2008) reported 64.9% of AA colon cancer patients over that age.
21687703:36	Sex-wise, SLC5A8 methylation was evenly distributed between male and female patients.
21687703:37	It has already been reported that certain loci are differentially methylated between the two genders.
21687703:38	Such is not the case for SLC5A8, at least within the colon tissue where its function does not seem to have any gender specific particularity.
21687703:39	There was a noticeable trend to have SLC5A8 methylation linked to samples that are right sided.
21687703:40	Ninety one percent of right sided samples vs. 70.59% left sided were methylated.
21687703:41	Proximal colon is known to be the site of more methylation events than the distal one . SLC5A8 methylation distributed equally among the 5 different categories of samples used in this study.
21687703:42	Tubulovillous, tubular, adenocarcinoma and polyps all showed a similar level of SLC5A8 methylation (∼80%) that was comparable to the value with the entire 50 samples analyzed here.
21687703:43	Villous adenomas (n = 2) showed 50% methylation, a rate mainly attributed to the low number of samples from this category.
21687703:44	Consequently, the methylation level seems not to be associated with any specific kind of adenomas in our group of African American patients.
21687703:45	Dong et al., have pointed to a major role of SLC5A8 methylation in the early stages leading to serrated lesions while Goldstein et al., has reported that SLC5A8 methylation along with BRAF mutation are major actors in the initiation of sessile serrated adenomas . The recently named serrated adenoma correspond to adenomas with combined architectural features of hyperplastic polyps and classical adenoma.
21687703:46	Most of the samples in this study are archived samples that have been classified prior to the advent of sessile adenomas nomenclature.
21687703:47	It would not be surprising to find that some might fall in this group.
21687703:48	However and since BRAF mutation seems to associate with SLC5A8 methylation in this group of adenomas, it would be unlikely.
21687703:49	Indeed, BRAF mutation in African American colon cancer samples based on our previous study of 222 samples was found only in 7 cases out of 222 .
21687703:50	It is noteworthy to remember that butyrate, that is being transported by SLC5A8 gene product, has a direct impact on histones acetylation status.
21687703:51	Ueno et al, have shown that in gastric cancer samples, histone H3 acetylation correlated directly with SLC5A8 expression and inversely with DNA methylation . Our laboratory has already established that there was a direct correlation, that was statistically significant between HDAC2 expression and colon cancer development in AAs .
21687703:52	Also, H3K12 and H4K18 acetylation status was decreased from normal to cancer AA samples although not in a statistically significant manner.
21687703:53	These findings put together piece some elements of the puzzle of AA colon carcinogenesis where SLC5A8 and HDAC2 expression play major roles through their combined effects on gene expression.
21687703:54	The proteomic data also revealed a higher expression of many histones 2A of different types in adenomas vs. normal tissues.
21687703:55	Histones 2A are known to affect chromatin structure and thus gene expression . Li and Jun reported that butyrate induces profound changes in the expression of at least 450 genes in bovine kidney epithelial cells . Such a tremendous effect would only be possible through chromatin remodeling where histones are involved.
21687703:56	The high level of SLC5A8 methylation in our study also fits the general picture about genes' methylation in AA colon cancer.
21687703:57	A recent study from our laboratory revealed that AAs, when compared to Iranian patients, have higher levels of methylation at 13 candidate cancer genes . This methylation, like SLC5A8 methylation, was age and sex independent highlighting an important role of hypermethylation in AA colon carcinogenesis.
21687703:58	Our exclusive choice to work with adenomas, and our inclusion of 5 polyps in this study strengthen that assumption and qualify SLC5A8 gene as a potential marker for early detection in this high risk group of patients.
14678564:0	Background 
Few metastatic tumours are curable and the principal aim of treatment is to improve patients' tumour-related symptoms to maximise quality of life (QoL).
14678564:1	A number of QoL and symptom assessment instruments [ - ] has been developed for use in patients with advanced tumours (Table 1 – see ).
14678564:2	These are usually completed by the patient, and predominantly are used as outcome measures in clinical trials [ - ].
14678564:3	In clinical practice, clinicians usually assess symptoms in a less formal fashion, although there are instruments, such as the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS)  that are used on a regular basis, in some practices.
14678564:4	Most appraisals of existing symptom assessment instruments have concluded that they are relevant and acceptable for QoL assessment in patients with advanced tumours [ - , , - ].
14678564:5	On the other hand, a number of limitations has been identified in existing instruments: many of the instruments are too lengthy to be administered regularly (e.g. the adapted symptom distress scale (ASDS), the functional assessment of cancer therapy scale-general (FACT-G), the McGill quality of life questionnaire (MQOL), the Memorial symptom assessment scale (MSAS), and the Rotterdam symptom checklist (RSCL)) [ , , ] or they provide only limited benefit in the assessment of symptoms in the more seriously ill patients (e.g. ESAS, RSCL, the patient evaluated problem scores (PEPS)) [ , ].
14678564:6	Further, the instrument may fail to measure the patient's experience (e.g. the support team assessment schedule (STAS)) , or the reference period is either absent or too short (MQOL) . Those that measure QoL rather than tumour-related symptoms (e.g. FACT-G, the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30), MQOL) tend to be too broad and less relevant for measuring symptoms . In contrast, other instruments are too short to be comprehensive (e.g. PEPS) , or there is doubt that the coverage of symptoms is appropriate (e.g. the M.D.
14678564:7	Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI)) . There is also inconsistency between the severity assessment scales used by different instruments, typically either indicating the impairment of functioning (e.g. FACT-G) , or the distress caused by a symptom or symptoms (e.g. ESAS, the symptom distress scale (SDS), modified SDS, ASDS, MQOL) [ - ], or both (e.g. MDASI, RSCL) . 
Because of these limitations, we decided to investigate the optimal coverage of symptoms necessary and the most appropriate severity assessment scale in an effort to identify an optimal symptom assessment instrument for patients with advanced tumours.
14678564:8	In this study, we explored patient and clinician prevalence rankings of tumour-related symptoms in outpatients with advanced tumours.
14678564:9	Based on these relationships, we identified the shortest list of symptoms that covered the major clusters of tumour-related symptoms best for this population.
14678564:10	We also examined two different severity assessment scales for each symptom to assess variation between the scales, and whether more than one type of severity assessment scale was needed.

Discussion 
The findings of this study suggest that the initial 20-item symptom list provided a reasonable representation of the symptoms experienced by patients with advanced tumours (Table ).
14678564:12	However, the comments received from the clinicians yielded two additional symptoms ( problems remembering things and coughing ) that proved to be highly prevalent in the patients with incurable tumours surveyed (39% and 23% respectively).
14678564:13	The other important suggestion provided by the clinicians was to focus on physical symptoms due to the tumour rather than emotional symptoms, since other instruments assess these better.
14678564:14	Consequently, we reduced the list to 18 symptoms that focused predominantly on physical problems.
14678564:15	The high prevalence rates for all 18 symptoms in the 44 outpatients with incurable tumours surveyed further supported the coverage (Table ).
14678564:16	However, these high rates made it difficult to identify individual symptoms that could be eliminated from the list, as we had aimed to identify only those symptoms essential for routine measurement.
14678564:17	We were able to reduce the number of symptoms further, while maintaining good coverage, by exploring symptom clusters.
14678564:18	Eleven symptoms were found to explain adequately the variation within the three clusters that covered the physical symptoms (Table ).
14678564:19	However, we added lack of appetite to the symptom list, making a final list of 12 symptoms.
14678564:20	Our findings are consistent with those of Watson et al  who also identified similar broad clusters of physical symptoms in cancer patients, using a 30-item version of the RSCL.
14678564:21	We believe that these three clusters (Table ) encompass the most important symptoms in patients with advanced tumours.
14678564:22	Using this final list of 12 symptoms as a guide, we reassessed existing symptom assessment instruments and found that some did not address all the symptoms we recommend (e.g. ESAS, MDASI), while others covered too many symptoms, making them too lengthy for regular administration (e.g. ASDS, MQOL, MSAS, RSCL).
14678564:23	For example, the core list of 13 symptoms of the MDASI  is limited in the assessment of neurological symptoms but contains a considerable number of symptoms related to emotional problems.
14678564:24	In our opinion, the usefulness of assessing emotional (or psychological) symptoms this way is questionable.
14678564:25	The CSS does not include assessment of emotional or psychological symptoms, as it concentrates on physical symptoms related to the tumour.
14678564:26	If assessment of emotional symptoms is also required, we recommend that another suitable instrument be used.
14678564:27	In summary, despite a relatively large number of available symptom assessment instruments, little research has been undertaken to determine the adequate coverage of symptom clusters appropriate for patients with advanced tumours, and consequently the minimum list of symptoms needed to measure these clusters.
14678564:28	In the present study, we undertook such an investigation that yielded three important symptom clusters and their associated symptoms.
14678564:29	Comparing our final list and existing symptom lists, we found major symptoms were missing from shorter lists most likely to be considered for routine measurement in clinical practice.
14678564:30	As a result, we recommend that modifications need to be made to existing instruments to address these limitations, and that further consideration be given to issues around the measurement of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms.
14678564:31	Based on our findings, we have identified a brief set of symptoms covering the common physical symptoms experienced by outpatients with advanced tumours.
14678564:32	From this we have developed a symptom assessment instrument called 'The Canberra Symptom Scorecard' (CSS) that comprehensively covers the important and common symptoms associated with advanced (incurable) tumours.
14678564:33	We believe that this instrument should help clinicians to monitor these symptoms in outpatients undergoing palliative treatment(s), such as palliative chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy or symptomatic treatments.
14678564:34	It is about to be assessed in patients with advanced tumours receiving palliative treatments in centres in Australia and overseas, and, as part of this assessment, it will be validated against existing instruments.
14678564:35	We believe that this investigation should establish the validity and usefulness of the CSS in patients with advanced tumours receiving palliative treatments aimed at improving patients' symptoms.
14678564:36	Conclusions 
We reviewed existing symptom assessment instruments and found a number of deficiencies such as existing instruments being too long or burdensome, too short, or measuring quality of life, rather than tumour-related physical symptoms.
14678564:37	Others sacrificed important physical symptoms for emotional symptoms that may be assessed better using psychological instruments.
14678564:38	Therefore, we devised a new symptom instrument ("The Canberra Symptom Scorecard", (CSS)).
14678564:39	This is a short 12-item symptom questionnaire that focuses on the physical symptoms important in patients with advanced tumours.
14678564:40	It appears suitable for outpatients with advanced (incurable) tumours receiving palliative treatments and is about to be assessed in such patients, both in Australia and overseas when it will also be validated against existing instruments.

19857256:0	Background 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains major cancer worldwide .
19857256:1	Although numerous epidemiological and biological studies have revealed risk/protective factors for CRC, present knowledge is still insufficient to allow the disease to be overcome, and the struggle to elucidate mechanisms is ongoing.
19857256:2	Recently, several a number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed an association between variants on chromosome 8q24 and several sites of cancer, including CRC [ - ].
19857256:3	Each study showed that rs6983267 resides in 128.47-128.54
19857256:4	MB on Chromosome 8, denoted as 'region 3,'  and consistently associated with CRC [ , ].
19857256:5	This association was confirmed in a subsequent large-scale replication study in Caucasians [ - ].
19857256:6	Most of these CRC GWASs were conducted in Caucasian populations, however, and the data available for Asian populations is limited especially about possible gene-environment interaction . 
The aim of the present case-control study was to clarify the impact of rs6983267 on CRC risk in a Japanese population.
19857256:7	In addition, we explored the gene-environmental interaction between potential confounders and rs6983267.
19857256:8	Methods 
Results 
Table shows baseline characteristics of the 481 CRC cases, with an average age of 60 years, and the 962 controls matched for sex and age.
19857256:9	Males accounted for 62.4% of subjects.
19857256:10	Apart from a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative, potential confounders showed no clear difference between cases and controls.
19857256:11	A family history of CRC was significantly more frequent among CRC cases.
19857256:12	Genotype distributions for 8q24 rs6983267 and rs10090154 are shown in Table .
19857256:13	Among controls, both genotypes were accordant with the HWE.
19857256:14	The minor allele frequency for rs6983267 was 0.338 (G-allele).
19857256:15	The age- and sex-adjusted in the allelic model showed an OR of 1.22 (1.04-1.44, p = 0.0144) and the confounder-adjusted model an OR of 1.25 (1.06-1.48, p = 0.0071).
19857256:16	Genotypic model showed a significant association only with rs6983267 GG genotype (OR = 1.64, 1.15-2.35, p = 0.0063).
19857256:17	In contrast, rs10090154 showed no association with CRC risk.
19857256:18	Table shows stratified analyses conducted to explore possible interactions between potential confounders although point estimates for ORs were not static; no significant interactions were seen between the factors examined and rs6983267.
19857256:19	The lack of association in those with a positive family history was of interest vis a vis the significant association in those without it, albeit that the number of subjects with a family history was limited.
19857256:20	Discussion 
In this study, we found that the G allele in rs6983267 was associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC in a Japanese population.
19857256:21	This finding is consistent with those from previous GWASs [ , ] and a pooled analysis , as reviewed in Table which reported the consistency of this association with CRC and colorectal adenoma in populations with European ancestry.
19857256:22	The only previous study of rs6983267 in a population with Asian ethnicity (Japanese-American) was that by Haiman et al , and to our knowledge the present study is the first indication in Japanese living in Japan.
19857256:23	Tenesa et al. reported significant association with rs7014346 in 8q24, which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs6983267, in Japanese population , supporting significant association between the rs6983267 in CRC in Japanese.
19857256:24	Recent advances in genetic analysis have enabled a comprehensive approach to identifying disease susceptibility loci.
19857256:25	The consistency of findings in this and the previous studies warrants the usefulness of the GWAS approach across ethnicities.
19857256:26	We also evaluated potential interactions between common background factors and rs6983267, but found no significant interaction between them.
19857256:27	Berndt et al. also reported a lack of interaction between rs6983267 and age, sex, smoking, family history of CRC and cancer site .
19857256:28	The consistency of this finding indicates that rs6983267 is associated with CRC risk independently of common risk factors.
19857256:29	Rs6983267 was originally identified using a non-hypothesis-based approach, and evidence has suggested a possible biological mechanism behind this observed association.
19857256:30	The rs6983267 polymorphism resides 15 kb upstream of a processed pseudogene ( POU5F1P1 ) of the POU-domain factor gene, POU5F1 which encodes transcription factor OCT4, with 97.5% shared identity . OCT4, a transcript of POU5F1 plays a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency, self-renewal and chromatin structure in stem cells , and promotes tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner . A conserved POU5F1-binding site I at the 5' promoter region of the WNT-signaling gene, FZD5 has been reported . Tomlinson et al. reported the expression of either POU5F1 or POU5F1P1 in cell lines and primary CRCs , while Suo et al. similarly reported the expression of these genes in cancer cell lines and cancer tissues . Given that OCT4 pseudogenes in mice are reported to mediate stem cell regulatory function , it is possible to hypothesize that OCT4 pseudogenes, including POU5F1P1 might play a role in stem cell proliferation.
19857256:31	However, no difference in expression according to rs6983267 status was observed . Berndt discussed the potential contribution of MYC which is located > 300 KB distant to rs6983267.
19857256:32	Recently, Pomerantz et al. reported rs6983267 displays a difference in binding of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) leading to a different physical interaction with MYC ; however, Tuupanen et al. failed to find clear association between rs6983267 genotype and MYC expression.
19857256:33	There still remains controversy between MYC and rs6983267 requiring further studies.
19857256:34	Moreover, Tuupanen et al. reported rs6983267 affects a binding site for the Wnt-regulated transcription factor (TCF4), with the risk allele G showing stronger binding in vivo and in vitro . Overall, these findings indicate that the possible biological mechanism behind the effect of rs6983267 polymorphism on CRC carcinogenesis requires further study.
19857256:35	We did not observe any association with rs10090154 (OR = 0.90) on the contrary to the results from Multi-ethnic cohort study .
19857256:36	The point estimate for minor allele in the previous study was 1.41 (95%CI: 1.14-1.75).
19857256:37	Following case-control study for Japanese American in Hawaii showed lack of association (OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 0.78-1.48).
19857256:38	Inconsistency across studies might come from the finding in the original GWAS was by chance although threshold in statistical significance was high enough.
19857256:39	Or, statistical power in following studies including ours was not good enough.
19857256:40	By all means, more evidence is needed to clarify significance of the locus.
19857256:41	Several potential limitations of the present study require consideration.
19857256:42	First, use of hospital-based control in this study for potential cause of selection bias.
19857256:43	We used non-cancer patients at our hospital as controls, given the likelihood that our cases arose within this population base.
19857256:44	Moreover, we previously showed that individuals selected randomly from our control population were similar to the general population in terms of baseline characteristics . Given the similarity in minor allele frequency between our controls and that in the HapMap database for Japanese, it is reasonable to assume the external validity of our study results to the general population.
19857256:45	Second, as with other case-control studies, this study may have suffered from information bias: although the questionnaires were completed before the diagnosis in our hospital, some patients referred from other institutions might have known their diagnosis.
19857256:46	Lack of interaction needs careful interpretation because confounders assessed in this study showed no association with CRC risk by themselves.
19857256:47	Conclusion 
Our present investigation showed that rs6983267 in 8q24 is an independent risk factor of CRC in a Japanese population.
19857256:48	Further studies to clarify the biological mechanisms of this association are warranted.

17381836:0	Background 
Cough is the commonest symptom for which medical advice is sought , and sales of over the counter cough syrups alone are worth as much as £92.5 m in the United Kingdom and $328 m in the United States . The majority of cases of cough are acute and self limiting, usually secondary to viral upper respiratory tract infection, however, chronic cough (lasting more than eight weeks) is also a significant problem, with reported prevalence of 10% to 30% [ - ].
17381836:1	Chronic cough is associated with a significant but reversible increase in morbidity, affecting quality of life , and would therefore seem to be an important, treatable clinical entity.
17381836:2	Most reports of the aetiology and management of chronic cough originate from specialist cough clinics and therefore reflect the experience of chronic cough in secondary care.
17381836:3	Indeed, good data on the prevalence and aetiology of cough in the general population are hard to find.
17381836:4	For example, the European Community Respiratory Health Survey targeted a large, unselected group from the general population (18,277 subjects from 16 countries) and included questions on cough .
17381836:5	However, only people aged 20 to 48 years were included.
17381836:6	Since most series of chronic cough patients show a mean age of 45–58 years , it is likely that the European Community Respiratory Health Survey missed a large proportion of people with chronic cough.
17381836:7	This report details the results of a postal questionnaire survey sent to people requesting further information on chronic cough.
17381836:8	It provides further information about the demographic and symptomatic profile in a population who consider their cough to be significant.
17381836:9	Methods 
In September 2002 a national UK BBC Radio 4 broadcast took place on chronic cough.
17381836:10	This was part of the series "Check Up", which offers medical advice on a different health-related topic each week and is broadcast at 3 pm on a Thursday afternoon.
17381836:11	Radio Joint Audience Research Limited (RAJAR) published audience figures for Radio 4 of 9.9 million listeners per week (11.8% share of all radio listeners) for the third quarter of 2002.
17381836:12	The BBC estimated that approximately 700,000 people will have listened to this broadcast.
17381836:13	Unfortunately, the authors do not have access to specific demographic data on this program's audience.
17381836:14	Of this population, 856 members of the public wrote in with stamped addressed envelopes for an information sheet about chronic cough.
17381836:15	The information pack they were sent included a cough questionnaire (see additional file ), which they were invited to complete and return in a pre-addressed, postage paid envelope, which was also enclosed.
17381836:16	The questionnaire used was based on one which is completed by all newly referred patients to the Hull Cough Clinic and completed again when the patients are discharged from the clinic, in order to audit social and demographic factors as well as qualitative measures of response to treatment.
17381836:17	It has therefore been completed by over 650 patients, prior to this study, although it has never previously been published.
17381836:18	It includes sections asking open questions on demographic details, history of the cough, previous treatment and smoking history, whilst information about the physical, psychological and social effects of the cough is also elicited, using a Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
17381836:19	Results 
Of the 856 questionnaires sent out, 373 were completed and returned, giving a response rate of 43.6%.
17381836:20	Since not all the respondents answered all questions data is expressed as percentages of the total number who answered a particular question.
17381836:21	Discussion 
In the past it has been difficult to provide accurate data on the epidemiology of chronic cough.
17381836:22	A number of questionnaire surveys have tried to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms , but they were not designed specifically to assess chronic cough and its effects on quality of life.
17381836:23	Many early studies used Medical Research Council criteria to assess prevalence of chronic bronchitis in a population [ - ].
17381836:24	For this reason the information they provide is not always applicable to the population suffering from clinically significant chronic cough.
17381836:25	More recently, however, a large community cross-sectional survey has confirmed the significant prevalence and female preponderance of chronic cough in the community . 
Until recently understanding of the effects of chronic cough on health status has been limited, although work on cough specific quality of life tools is now starting to provide us with measurable health outcome data .
17381836:26	However, these tools have only been used so far in patients attending specialist cough centres, reflecting the experience of chronic cough in secondary and tertiary care.
17381836:27	The present study reports on the demographic data as well as the effects of chronic cough on physical, social and psychological aspects of health of a large group of self selected patients with chronic cough, recruited from the general Radio 4 listening public.
17381836:28	However although much of the data was collected in numeric form (on a Likert scale), in order to gain some indication of severity, the results must be regarded as qualitative, rather than quantitative, as this questionnaire has not previously been formally validated.
17381836:29	This study population evidently can not be said to represent all subjects in the community with cough, due to the usual types of selection bias associated with this type of study.
17381836:30	Self selection of questionnaire respondents and factors such as time of day, mode and network of the broadcast mean that the demographics of listeners to the radio broadcast cannot be expected to be wholly representative of the general population.
17381836:31	However, the large estimated audience of 700,000 suggests that they are drawn from a wider group than the population usually seen in a specialist cough clinic and the fact that they have responded to an unsolicited questionnaire suggests that these data represent a profile of a clinically relevant group suffering from a troublesome chronic cough.
17381836:32	Notable similarities exist between the demography of our study population and that described in previous reports from secondary care.
17381836:33	For example, the high proportion of females (73%) is similar to that reported in the recent literature, with published series from various specialist clinics consisting of between 55% and 78% females . In clinical practice this marked gender difference is thought to be related to the observation that cough reflex sensitivity is heightened in both female healthy volunteers  and in female chronic cough patients , when compared with their male counterparts.
17381836:34	However, although the gender distribution of chronic cough in our community-based sample corresponds well with observations in secondary and tertiary care, the mean age of 65.4 years in our population was somewhat higher than the range of mean ages (45 to 58 years) quoted in the literature .
17381836:35	It is impossible to tell whether these findings were related either wholly or in part to selection and reporting bias or whether other factors, such as increased cough sensitivity in women or limitation of access to tertiary referral cough clinics are also responsible.
17381836:36	However, RAJAR audience profiling figures for the timeslot in which this radio broadcast was made suggest that the listeners were 54% female with a mean age of 56.
17381836:37	This would suggest that the demographics of our study population may not be entirely due to the age and gender profile of the audience.
17381836:38	Past experience reveals that although smoking is known to be associated with a dose related increase in reported cough , in practice smokers rarely seek medical advice for cough .
17381836:39	This presumably is because they do not perceive the cough to require medical attention, or they erroneously ascribe their chronic cough to smoking and is consistent with the very low proportion of current smokers (2%) who presented in this survey.
17381836:40	This survey confirms that chronic cough is poorly treated in the studied population.
17381836:41	Despite a high rate of medical consultations and of prescribing the median duration of cough was still 6.5 years.
17381836:42	24% of respondents claimed to have a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and 32% had been prescribed either oral or inhaled corticosteroids at some point, but only 9% of respondents reported that these treatments had helped at all.
17381836:43	This may be due, at least in part, to the self selected nature of the population as individuals who had gained good effect from prescribed medications might be less likely to respond to the questionnaire; however other explanations are also possible.
17381836:44	For example, the accuracy of the diagnoses of asthma cannot be confirmed as we have no information regarding who the diagnosis was made by, or the grounds on which it was made.
17381836:45	Even if a correct diagnosis of asthma has been made, this does not rule out the presence of some other additional cause of cough such as reflux disease, which would not improve with steroid treatment.
17381836:46	In addition, we have no information regarding the dose or duration of treatment which, if inadequate, might contribute to the likelihood of treatment failure.
17381836:47	Cough syrups, lozenges and water, however, ranked highly as treatments that were alleged to help the cough, outranking many prescribed treatments such as beta-2 agonists and nasal steroids.
17381836:48	Only 10% of respondents reported that cough syrups and sweets had been prescribed but, when asked which treatments (prescribed or self-medicated) had helped the cough, approximately 10% of respondents stated that syrups or sweets had helped and 12% gave answers such as cold water, chewing gum, alcohol, etc, which were grouped in the "Other" category in this report.
17381836:49	This may simply reflect the fact that these remedies are much more freely available to the public than prescription medications, but it is interesting to note their perceived efficacy especially since most over the counter cough remedies rely on similar demulcent and non-pharmacological strategies which may have previously been ascribed to "placebo effect" . Their reported efficacy in this study and burgeoning over the counter sales casts doubt on reports that they do not significantly improve cough symptoms.
17381836:50	The impact of chronic cough on health status is varied, ranging from minimal in some patients to a disabling symptom in others.
17381836:51	However, the reasons which lead patients to seek advice are complex and poorly understood . Work developing cough specific quality of life measures in secondary care has revealed effects of chronic cough in physical, psychological and social health domains , which are consistent with our community-based data.
17381836:52	For example, in the psychological domain, feelings such as anger, frustration, anxiety and depression were reported by a majority of questionnaire respondents.
17381836:53	Similarly, our results show that cough affected social life in two thirds of subjects, leading many of them to alter their behaviour, often avoiding situations and places which might trigger the cough or where they might be embarrassed by the cough.
17381836:54	Cough related morbidity in terms of physical symptoms was also varied with cough associated breathlessness, sore throat, fatigue and sleep disturbance being prominent.
17381836:55	These extensive and potentially significant effects of cough on health status highlight the importance of a detailed history of associated symptoms and concerns when assessing a patient with chronic cough.
17381836:56	Although this questionnaire was not designed to be a diagnostic tool, there were several questions which may give clues as to the possible underlying causes of the cough.
17381836:57	Previous work suggests that gastroesophageal disease, asthma and rhinitis are the most common causes of chronic cough . In this survey the majority of respondents reported one or more symptoms which might be suggestive of these diagnoses, such as heartburn, wheeze and post-nasal drip.
17381836:58	Although this data is far from sufficient to make any conclusions about the causes of the reported cough, it is interesting to note that only 13% of people had none of the aforementioned symptoms which, if reported in a cough clinic, might lead to further investigation or treatment of these common aetiological factors.
17381836:59	Other symptoms suggestive of more serious pulmonary pathology, such as expectoration of more than 1 cup of sputum per day and haemoptysis had a reassuringly low prevalence (1% and 8% respectively).
17381836:60	Vocal symptoms, however, were very common.
17381836:61	This, coupled with the high incidence of cough on phonation, for example on the telephone, might lead a clinician to consider a possible diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux, a diagnosis which is often under-recognised in chronic cough patients.
17381836:62	This syndrome of laryngeal irritation is caused by supra-oesophageal reflux of gastric juices and has different characteristics to gastroesophageal reflux related to oesophagitis .
17381836:63	At present the prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux as a cause of chronic cough is not known.
17381836:64	The presumption that chronic cough represents a significant burden on NHS resources and especially on primary care services, is supported by the observation that 91% of respondents to this survey had consulted a general practitioner about the cough and 60% had seen at least one hospital specialist.
17381836:65	However, the fact that only 40% of respondents had found a treatment that helped indicates that it is sub-optimally managed in this population, since several series of systematic management show treatment success rates in excess of 90% .
17381836:66	Although we must acknowledge that subjects with unresolved and on-going troublesome cough would be more likely to seek information and therefore answer this questionnaire than those whose cough had resolved with treatment, the fact that these individuals had sought medical advice from several sources, without success is undeniable.
17381836:67	We suggest the main reason underlying this failure is the poor recognition in both primary and secondary care of the aetiology of chronic cough [18].
17381836:68	Since the morbidity of the physical, psychological and social symptoms associated with chronic cough is high and simple treatments are often highly successful it should be possible to manage this unmet need more effectively.
17381836:69	Conclusion 
In conclusion, we have shown that chronic cough causes a high level of morbidity in affected individuals, which results in a correspondingly high rate of healthcare utilisation by these individuals.
17381836:70	In the authors' opinion, chronic cough is currently poorly diagnosed and managed outside of specialist cough clinics, mainly due to a widespread lack of knowledge of the aetiology of this debilitating, but eminently treatable symptom.
17381836:71	If understanding is enhanced, management of chronic cough may improve and many patients will be helped.

Discussion 
The current study implicates endogenously produced IFN-α/β in causing depletion of the pluripotential and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors during the first week of LCMV infection.
9053452:1	LCMV-induced abnormalities of peripheral blood parameters correlated positively with the IFN responder phenotype of mice.
9053452:2	The key finding was that in IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice, peripheral hematologic parameters and the frequency of blood cell precursors in the BM were comparable in LCMV-infected and uninfected control mice.
9053452:3	Conversely, the decrease in peripheral blood values after infection with LCMV in wild-type, IFN-γ R 0/0, CD4 0/0, CD8 0/0, P 0/0, or lpr mice was associated with a substantial reduction of the numbers of pluripotential progenitor cells and lineage-committed precursors and, to a lesser extent, of the morphologically recognizable compartment in the BM.
9053452:4	The depletion of the blood cell progenitors was attributable to a direct effect of IFN-α/β and was independent of contact-dependent cytotoxicity or secreted factors from NK cells.
9053452:5	This is suggested by the NK activity in BM of wild-type mice and in mice lacking either the IFN-α/β R or the IFN-γ R. Additionally, virus specific effector T cells generated within the first 7 d of infection apparently played no critical role in LCMV-induced transient BM aplasia, because knockout mice either lacking peripheral CD8 + or CD4 + T cells were similarly depleted of pluripotential and committed progenitors.
9053452:6	A summary of the relevant findings in wild type and in the different mutant mouse strains is presented in Table . 
The viral and host parameters defining the abnormalities of peripheral blood cells in the acute phase were influenced to a minor extent by the LCMV isolate; however, they correlated with the IFN-α/β responder phenotype of the genetic background of the host.
9053452:7	This is documented by the fact that within a given mouse strain, the extent of the pancytopenia in the acute phase of infection was not determined by the divergent replication kinetics of a rapidly (Docile), intermediate (WE), or slowly (Armstrong) replicating LCMV isolate.
9053452:8	This observation is in accordance with earlier findings, demonstrating comparable maximal serum levels of IFN-α/β induced by several LCMV isolates in mice of the same genetic background.
9053452:9	Between the various mouse strains marked differences in the amount of IFN-α/β production have been measured, yet in adult mice no correlation between serum levels of IFN-α/β and susceptibility to lethal choriomeningitis has been demonstrated.
9053452:10	Evidence for a link between IFN-α/β induction and disease, however, was established in newborn mice infected with LCMV.
9053452:11	In these studies, the severity of the delay in organ maturation and liver necrosis as well as the incidence of death was directly dependent on the extent of the endogenous IFN-α/β response of the different mouse strains infected with LCMV.
9053452:12	Moreover, the concept of a causal correlation between the amount of endogenously induced IFN-α/β by LCMV and the severity of BM suppression is in line with in vitro findings, demonstrating IFN-α/β to be a potent inhibitor of proliferation/ maturation of normal BM-derived hematopoietic progenitors, as well as of certain leukemic cells in vivo (e.g., hairy cell leukemia [43], and CML [44]).
9053452:13	Interestingly, expansion and functional activation of NK cells in LCMV-infected BM of IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice was comparable to that in IFN-γ R 0/0 and wild-type mice, especially when absolute numbers of NK cells were considered.
9053452:14	NK cells are cytolytically activated and proliferate after stimulation with IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, or IL-2 in vitro and in vivo and the peak of NK activity after LCMV infection parallels the maximal serum concentration of IFN-α/β.
9053452:15	Apparently, in our experimental model, NK cells from IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice, which cannot be stimulated by IFN-α/β signaling via the IFN-α/β R, were comparably activated.
9053452:16	This result may hypothetically signal an IFN-α/β effect that is not mediated via the classic IFN-α/β R deleted in these mice.
9053452:17	An alternative (i.e., not IFN-α/β R-dependent) activation pathway of NK cells in LCMV-infected IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice is documented further by the finding, that poly I/C, which is a synthetic double-stranded RNA and a potent inducer of the IFN-α/β system in vivo, did not stimulate NK cells in the BM.
9053452:18	More likely, NK activity in LCMV-infected IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice could be due to stimulation by other cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-12) induced by the overwhelming replication of LCMV in IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice.
9053452:19	There is conflicting data on the role of NK cells inhibiting hematopoiesis in vitro.
9053452:20	Under some conditions, human NK cells suppress myelopoietic and erythropoietic colony formation.
9053452:21	In murine systems, NK cells have been reported to inhibit growth of syngeneic hematopoietic progenitors or the more primitive CFU-S, but other studies have demonstrated normal hematopoiesis in vitro in the presence of NK cells.
9053452:22	Moreover, it has been suggested that both the antiviral properties as well as the suppressive effect on in vitro colony formation of NK cells function via the secretion of soluble factors, such as IFN-γ or TNF-α.
9053452:23	As for acute LCMV infection, one report proposed syngeneic rejection of stem cells by activated NK cells, because treatment with antiasialo GM 1 (a rabbit antiserum depleting NK cells but also partially LCMV-specific CTL nonspecifically [55]) partially restored the marrow repopulating ability of stem cells from uninfected syngeneic controls transferred into irradiated LCMV-infected mice.
9053452:24	In our experimental system, there was no evidence of NK-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis, either via contact-dependent cytotoxicity or secreted cytokines, because ( a ) at the timepoint of maximal NK activity we found normal precursor and differentiated blood cell frequencies in the BM of IFN-α/β R 0/0, but a drastic reduction of all hematopoietic compartments in IFN-γ R 0/0, lpr and P 0/0 mice, in which functionally inactive NK cells proliferate after LCMV infection, and ( b ) TM-β1, which is a mAb specific for the IL-2 R β chain and which induces a long-lasting selective depletion of NK cells, but considerably less of T cells, did not abrogate LCMV-induced suppression of peripheral blood parameters.
9053452:25	A subtle effect of IFN-γ could be observed 7 d after LCMV infection, at a timepoint when bone marrow cellularity was restored in IFN-γ R 0/0 mice, but not in wild-type mice (Fig. ).
9053452:26	When compared with IFN-α/β, the efficiency of LCMV-induced endogenous IFN-γ in suppressing BM function seems to be much weaker, however, because the CBC and BM cellularity of IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice were not altered at that stage of LCMV infection.
9053452:27	The finding of megakaryocytes and myeloid precursors expressing LCMV antigen in high amounts in the presence of activated NK cells, and yet lack of NK-mediated immunopathology in the BM of IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice, was surprising.
9053452:28	One possible explanation might be that LCMV by itself, in contrast with some other viruses, such as murine cytomegalovirus, does not alter class I MHC expression nor does it inhibit the ability of IFN-γ to upregulate MHC class I in virus-infected cells.
9053452:29	Therefore, LCMV-infected MHC class I–expressing hematopoietic precursors could be protected from NK cell–mediated lysis because cells expressing high levels of MHC class I are more resistant to NK cells than those lacking expression of MHC class I.
9053452:30	Although there is evidence for Fas ligand expression on the cell surface of freshly isolated murine NK cells, the role of the Fas pathway in NK killing in vivo is still poorly understood.
9053452:31	In vitro studies have demonstrated some Fas expression on human erythroid and myeloid colonies in the presence of TNF-α and/or IFN-γ, as well as upregulation of the Fas antigen by influenza virus–elicited IFN-α/β on HeLa cells.
9053452:32	The theoretical possibility, that Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells against Fas-expressing BM cells could be involved in LCMV-induced BM aplasia, is not supported here because NK cells were not critical in the first place.
9053452:33	Furthermore, lpr mice exhibited a comparable suppression of BM and blood values in the presence of highly activated NK cells (data not shown) 3 d after LCMV infection; this documents a minor significance of the Fas receptor–Fas ligand system of NK cells, because a nonoperational apoptotic signaling in lpr mice did not revert LCMV-induced transient depression of hematopoiesis.
9053452:34	Mutant IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice exhibited an intense viral replication in megakaryocytes and, to a lesser extent, in myeloid precursors.
9053452:35	Interestingly, LCMV by itself did not interfere with maturation and the release of platelets or granulocytes into the circulation, because the number of these blood cells remained unchanged in acutely infected IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice.
9053452:36	We do not not know at which stage of maturation megakaryocytes are infected in IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice, but it is conceivable that LCMV might infect morphologically unidentifiable progenitors of the megakaryocytic lineage.
9053452:37	A similar finding has been described for HIV patients, for which it has been proposed that HIV infection of megakaryocytic or myeloid progenitors by itself does not inhibit their proliferation/differentiation potential in vivo unless antibodies suppressing the growth of these progenitors are present in the serum.
9053452:38	We had no evidence of infection of pluripotential hematopoietic progenitors, because erythroblasts did not express viral Ag in serial BM analysis during the first week of LCMV infection.
9053452:39	LCMV seemed to persist for a longer time period in megakaryocytes than in myeloid precursors, because immature granulocytes were virus free on day 7 of LCMV infection, whereas a considerable proportion of megakaryocytes still stained positively for viral Ag.
9053452:40	This finding may be due to differences in the cellular tropism of LCMV but could simply reflect the fact that the turnover of myeloid cells is much higher and, therefore, infected myeloid precursors were released into circulation very efficiently.
9053452:41	Although IFN-α/β R 0/0 mice are able to mount normal Th and CTL responses against cytopathic viruses like vaccinia or vesicular stomatitis virus, LCMV specific CTL activity is lacking due to exhaustive activation of virus-specific CTL.
9053452:42	Therefore, the excessive viral multiplication in megakaryocytes and, to a lesser extent, in myeloid precursors was not associated with a CTL-mediated immunopathology, documented by the normal range of these cells in the BM and normal values of circulating blood cells.
9053452:43	In addition, LCMV-activated CD4 + or CD8 + T cells or their secreted products (e.g., TNF-β, IFN-γ) could not account for BM suppression in acute LCMV infection, since CD8 0/0 and CD4 0/0 mutant mice, which have no CD8 + or CD4 + T cells in the periphery, respectively, had comparably reduced hematopoietic progenitors and blood cells.
9053452:44	It should be pointed out, however, that the present study analyzed the acute phase of LCMV infection, in which innate immune mechanisms dominate and the frequency of LCMVspecific CTL is still increasing.
9053452:45	Therefore, the pathogenesis of hematologic abnormalities at later timepoints of infection might be distinct from the one described here and may involve other immunopathologic mechanisms, e.g., cytolytic activity or secreted cytokines from CTL, such as TNF-β or IFN-γ.
9053452:46	The presented results and concepts may be generalizable and offer explanations for mechanisms of hematopoietic disease in noncytopathic viral infections and hemorrhagic fevers caused not only by infection with arenaviruses such as LCMV or Junin virus but also by Dengue fever virus.
9053452:47	For these viruses, high concentrations of IFN-α/β have been measured in the serum, and the magnitude and the duration of circulating IFN-α/β correlated directly with the severity and the evolution of the disease ( – ).

21489243:0	Introduction 
Bartonella henselae is a gram-negative, zoonotic pathogen with world-wide distribution.
21489243:1	Cats have been identified as reservoir hosts but there is evidence that dogs might also serve as a primary reservoir . In cats, B. henselae causes a long-lasting intraerythrocytic bacteraemia and the organism is transmitted between cats by cat fleas . Transmission by other arthropods, such as ticks, has also been suggested . Interestingly, the number of reservoir hosts has increased continuously (for overview see ).
21489243:2	B. henselae is the aetiologic agent of the cat scratch disease (CSD).
21489243:3	The organism is transmitted from infected cats to humans by bites or scratches.
21489243:4	In most cases, the onset of the disease is a unilateral lymphadenitis in the lymph draining region near the site of the scratch or bite which occurs 2-3 weeks after infection.
21489243:5	Usually, CSD is self-limiting and patients do not require antibiotic treatment.
21489243:6	However, the clinical course of a B. henselae infection can vary from asymptomatic infections towards severe and chronic illness which might cause difficulties in the laboratory diagnosis of such disease.
21489243:7	In immunosuppressed patients (e.g., AIDS patients), B. henselae infections can result in proliferations of mainly capillary-sized vessels in the skin (bacillary angiomatosis) or liver (peliosis hepatis).
21489243:8	The pathogen is detectable within these lesions, and bacterial eradication by antibiotic treatment results in regression of the angiomatous tumours . Interestingly, current reports describe that B. henselae can also cause bacteremia in immunocompetent patients .
21489243:9	Although research with the slow growing and fastidious B. henselae is hampered by difficulties in performing molecular genetics and by the lack of suitable animal models, two essential pathogenicity factors of B. henselae have been identified and investigated in detail in recent years: (i) Bartonella adhesin A (BadA) which mediates adhesion to the extracellular matrix and mammalian host cells and (ii) the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system which modulates mammalian host cell functions by injecting Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) . In addition, a further type IV secretion system (Trw-system), other adhesins and potentially filamentous hemagglutinins might also contribute to the pathogenicity of B. henselae .
21489243:10	This manuscript gives a brief overview of these pathogenicity factors and their possible interactions in the course of infection.
21489243:11	Bartonella adhesin A (BadA) 
Adherence to the host is one of the most important steps during bacterial infection processes.
21489243:12	In B. henselae this first and decisive adherence is provided by the trimeric autotransporter adhesin BadA  (see Figure ).
21489243:13	Trimeric autotransporter adhesins are widespread in alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria and play important roles in the pathogenicity of many gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Yersinia enterocolitica Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria meningitidis ) . Trimeric autotransporter adhesins are built in a characteristic trimeric, "lollipop"-like surface structure and share a modular organisation consisting of different domains . The C-terminal membrane anchor is homologous throughout all trimeric autotransporter adhesins, forms trimers and provides the autotransport activity.
21489243:14	During assembly, trimeric autotransporter adhesins are secreted into the periplasm via the secretory (Sec)-pathway and the membrane anchor forms a pore by building a trimeric 12-stranded beta-barrel in the outer membrane.
21489243:15	Head and stalk domains are transported through the pore to the cell surface and the C-terminal part of the stalk locks the pore . 
Monomeric BadA has a molecular weight of 328 kDa (trimeric: ~ 1.000 kDa) and an enormous length of ~240 nm caused mainly by a long and highly repetitive stalk element.
21489243:16	Experiments with a mutant strain lacking almost the whole stalk region suggest that the stalk plays a crucial role in fibronectin binding . Additionally, BadA mediates bacterial autoagglutination, binding to extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagens, laminin), adhesion to host cells and the induction of proangiogenic host cell responses via the activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1, the key transcription factor involved in angiogenesis, and the subsequent secretion of angiogenic cytokines [e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] . These functional properties were assigned to the head domain of BadA which consists of three subdomains: the N-terminal subdomain is homologous to the head of Y. enterocolitica adhesin A (YadA) which represents the best characterized trimeric autotransporter adhesin.
21489243:17	A highly conserved, short sequence, the neck domain, acts as a linker for two other subdomains (Trp-Ring and GIN) . So far, no particular biological functions have been assigned to these subdomains of the BadA head domain.
21489243:18	Filamentous hemagglutinin 
Further to trimeric autotransporter adhesins, other adhesins like filamentous hemagglutinins are known to mediate adhesion to host cells in gram negative bacteria . In contrast to trimeric autotransporter adhesins, the presence of filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB) necessarily depends on a second partner (FhaC/HecB).
21489243:19	After Sec-dependent secretion of both proteins to the periplasm, FhaC/HecB forms a transmembrane beta-barrel that allows FhaB to cross the outer membrane.
21489243:20	At the cell surface, the protein is further modified and reaches final maturity [ - ].
21489243:21	Analysis of the genome sequence of B. henselae revealed eight genes of different lengths encoding homologues of filamentous hemagglutinin ( fhaB1-8 ), and four genes encoding homologues of their corresponding partner secretion proteins ( fhaC / hecB1-4 ) . First and indirect experimental evidence for a potential role of filamentous hemagglutinin in infection process of human endothelial cells derived from a genome-wide transcriptional profiling of a B. henselae mutant lacking the response regulator BatR: together with its sensor partner BatS, BatR controlled the expression of horizontally transmitted gene sets critical for the diverse host-associated life styles of B. henselae . Expression of fhaC / hecB was reported to be upregulated by BatR, indicating a possible role of filamentous hemagglutinin in the process of adhesion to host cells . Currently, there are no experimental data but only speculations on the role of filamentous hemagglutinin in the infection process with B.
21489243:22	henselae . 
VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system 
B. henselae adhesins might interact with other important pathogenicity factors like type IV secretion systems.
21489243:23	Such secretion machineries span the inner and outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and transfer bacterial effector proteins or DNA to a bacterial or eukaryotic recipient cell probably by a pilus or other surface- protruding filament . The B. henselae VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system (i) mediates rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in the formation of bacterial aggregates on the cell surface that are subsequently internalized ("invasome" structure), (ii) triggers a proinflammatory phenotype via activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB that in turn induces the secretion of interleukin-8 and the expression of the cell adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and E-selectin and (iii) is crucial for the inhibition of endothelial apoptosis .
21489243:24	Moreover, the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system is crucially involved in establishing a chronic and bacteraemic infection of the host, as shown in a Bartonella tribocorum -rat infection model . 
To date, seven Bartonella effector proteins (BepA-F) have been identified that are translocated by the type IV secretion system machinery . BepA was found to protect endothelial cells from apoptosis  and promotes capillary sprouting in an three-dimensional endothelial spheroid infection model.
21489243:25	Furthermore, BepG inhibits BepA dependent sprouting and, therefore, both proteins may control angiogenesis during B.
21489243:26	henselae infections . The combined action of BepC and BepF, but also of BepG itself, induces "invasome"-mediated internalization by inhibiting bacterial endocytosis . So far, it can be assumed that the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system might interact functionally with BadA and the filamentous hemagglutinin.
21489243:27	Potentially, these adhesins establish a first and close contact to the host cell surface and act as spacers providing the optimum distance between the bacterium and the host cell for subsequent protein translocation by the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system.
21489243:28	Further experiments are required to understand the interaction of these key virulence factors in more detail.
21489243:29	Trw type IV secretion system 
Beside the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system, the B. henselae genome sequence revealed genes for a second Trw type IV secretion system.
21489243:30	Trw-deficient mutants of Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella birtlesii were unable to establish a long-lasting bacteremia in their respective animal models.
21489243:31	The Trw type IV secretion system was suggested to be essential for intracellular colonization of erythrocytes, whereas a role in infection of endothelial cells was not found . Furthermore, the Trw system mediates host-specificity of erythrocyte infections . Therefore, the Trw type IV secretion system of B. henselae might represent a further important pathogenicity factor for establishing chronic bacteremia in the primary (feline) host and possibly interacts with adhesins during the primary infection process, comparable to the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system.
21489243:32	Conclusion 
B. henselae infections are of increasing interest in veterinary and human medicine.
21489243:33	The pathogen causes a long-lasting bacteremia in its feline primary host and cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis and other diseases in humans.
21489243:34	Only a limited knowledge about pathomechanisms operating in the course of a B. henselae infection exists.
21489243:35	The best described pathogenicity factors are the VirB/D4 type IV secretion system, Bartonella adhesin A (BadA) and the Trw system.
21489243:36	The trimeric autotransporter adhesin BadA ensures the contact of B. henselae to host cells and extracellular matrix proteins; filamentous hemagglutinin might also fulfill this function.
21489243:37	Adhesion might be a necessary prerequisite to allow subsequent bacterial host cell modulation by the VirB/D4 type IV secretion systems.
21489243:38	Currently it is not obvious whether similar pathomechanisms occur in both animal reservoir hosts and human patients.
21489243:39	The development of a suitable B. henselae animal infection model, especially mimicking vasculoproliferative disorders, would greatly promote Bartonella research.

19200371:0	Background 
The pharmacological, physiological and pathological roles of gasotransmitters nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been extensively researched in the reproductive system.
19200371:1	NO donors have been demonstrated to relax the myometrium  and maintain uterine quiescence . CO has been demonstrated to relax smooth muscle, including human myometrium via a sGC-cGMP mechanism . Hydrogen sulphide (H 2S) is another gasotransmitter that has many parallels with NO and CO , however there are no reports to date on the production of H 2S in reproductive tissues.
19200371:2	H 2S is endogenously produced from L-cysteine by two pyridoxal 5' phosphate-dependent enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) [ - ].
19200371:3	A high expression of CBS has been found in the central nervous system  while CSE is highly expressed in vascular tissues in the rat . An early study by Smythe  observed the production of H 2S in rat liver from L-cysteine.
19200371:4	In more recent studies various mammalian tissues have been shown to produce H 2S, including the brain (50–160 μM), the ileum, the kidneys and vascular tissue [ , ].
19200371:5	The physiological roles of H 2S have been well established.
19200371:6	Abe and Kimura  suggested possible role of H 2S as an endogenous neuromodulator in rat brain tissue, where it is involved in synaptic transmission.
19200371:7	In the cardiovascular system H 2S acts as a vasodilator both in vivo and in vitro and reduces blood pressure in vivo.
19200371:8	The mechanism of action of H 2S is unknown.
19200371:9	However, unlike NO, H 2S dilates blood vessels possibly via a novel mechanism that involves the opening of K + ATP channels . The role of H 2S as an inflammatory mediator is supported by the pharmacological inhibition of H 2S biosynthesis by the CSE enzyme inhibitor D,L-propargylglycine or β-cyano-L-alanine in conditions such as acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock and endotoxemia [ - ].
19200371:10	H 2S as a smooth muscle relaxant has been investigated in various smooth muscle tissues.
19200371:11	The H 2S donor sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) relaxed guinea pig and rat ileum smooth muscle and also the thoracic aorta and portal vein . Sidhu et al .  showed that NaHS relaxed isolated pregnant rat uterine strips in vitro, demonstrating the role of H 2S as a smooth muscle relaxant.
19200371:12	However the study did not investigate the production of H 2S or the expression of the CBS and CSE enzymes in intrauterine tissues, and this has not been reported previously.
19200371:13	The aim of the present study was to investigate the endogenous production of H 2S and identify the expression of CBS and CSE enzymes in rat and human intrauterine tissues.

Discussion 
Conclusion 
Basal production of H 2S was demonstrated in rat uterus, placenta, fetal membranes and human placenta.
19200371:15	The endogenous production of H 2S was up-regulated by the NO donor SNP in rat fetal membranes.
19200371:16	Exposure of cell homogenates from rat liver, uterus, fetal membranes and human placenta, to low oxygen levels increased H 2S production rates.
19200371:17	The presence of CBS and CSE enzymes was demonstrated, for the first time, in rat and human intrauterine tissues.
19200371:18	Endogenously produced H 2S could possibly have a role in the pathology of pre-eclampsia, however further investigation of the role of H 2S in the reproductive system is required.

18752684:0	Introduction 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) has been shown to be expressed in many of the cells that play a role in the response to vascular injury and to modulate the actions that are thought to initiate neointimal (NI) growth, including inflammation [ - ].
18752684:1	Neointimal formation is an important structural change in the vessel wall that leads to restenosis after angioplasty or stenting [ - ].
18752684:2	Thiazolidinediones consist of a family of synthetic compounds that acts as high-affinity ligands for PPARγ and were originally developed to facilitate glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
18752684:3	In addition, they have a direct impact on vascular cells and reduce circulating factors that are associated with atherosclerosis . In a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials there was evidence that thiazolidinedione therapy in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation may be associated with less in-stent restenosis and repeated revascularization [ - ].
18752684:4	Three different thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and troglitazone, have been shown to prevent balloon-injured rat carotid arteries . Rosiglitazone can reduce the NI formation and macrophage content in a mouse injury model  and in hypercholesterolemic rabbits . These effects were independent of glycemic control or changes in lipid concentrations . In the present study we analyse the effects of rosiglitazone (RGZ) on neointimal formation administered at different times in hypercholesterolemic rabbits following vascular injury.
18752684:5	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Prevention of restenosis after balloon coronary angioplasty or stent implantation with the use of local and systemic therapy is a challenging issue in interventional cardiology [ - ].
18752684:6	Osborne et al  showed that a short term model of hypercholesterolemia (two to four weeks) prevents extremely high cholesterol values and formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.
18752684:7	Nevertheless, the arteries isolated from animals fed a cholesterol-enriched diet developed defects in endothelium-dependent relaxation in both large vessels as well as coronary resistance vessels . These effects could be, in part, responsible for the restenosis after balloon angioplasty.
18752684:8	Thiazolidinediones have immunomodulatory and antiproliferative effects, independent of their actions in metabolic control and are expressed in most cell types of the vascular wall as in atherosclerotic lesions, where they can affect atherogenic process [ - ].
18752684:9	To investigate the effects of a PPARγ ligand (rosiglitazone) on atherogenesis in an animal model, we used rabbits with six-fold increased cholesterol levels at the time of vascular injury and fourteen-fold increased levels at the time of euthanasia.
18752684:10	This animal model was based on previous studies where rabbits develop hypercholesterolemia rapidly after excessive cholesterol feeding [ , ].
18752684:11	The metabolic effects of high cholesterol-containing diet on rabbits were extensively explained in our previous study . Rosiglitazone was used at different times for each group.
18752684:12	Group II not only did not present atherosclerotic lesions but also did not show any deposit of collagen or macrophage and smooth muscle cell markers in their intimal layer.
18752684:13	The most significant findings were identified in the higher luminal area and the lower intimal area in which rabbits were treated with RGZ before vascular injury.
18752684:14	Furthermore, in CG and group I intense reparative response occurred, with exuberant neointimal formation and reduction of luminal area.
18752684:15	In addition, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a reduced macrophage and smooth muscle cell recruitment into the vascular arterial wall when RGZ was used two weeks before catheter balloon injury.
18752684:16	Rosiglitazone did not exert anti-atherosclerotic activity when administered after vascular injury, however, a lesser density of macrophages in the media layer was observed in the animals of group I.
18752684:17	We cannot rule out that these effects were due to chance, as our evaluation period was short.
18752684:18	These findings suggest a possible protective effect of this drug against neointimal proliferation and remodeling responsible for restenosis after a balloon angioplasty.
18752684:19	This is the first study to show the effects of a PPARγ ligand on vascular injury at different times and to document the benefits of pre-treatment with RGZ in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.
18752684:20	Nevertheless, this drug has been the focus of extensive discussion in recent publications [ - ].
18752684:21	Nissen and Wolski  published a meta-analysis showing a significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction and an increase in cardiovascular death of borderline significance in patients with diabetes receiving RGZ.
18752684:22	Singh et al  also published a meta-analysis showing a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes using rosiglitazone for at least 12 months, with no significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.
18752684:23	Lipscombe et al , in a nested case-control analysis of a retrospective cohort study, found that in diabetes patients with an age of 66 years or older, RGZ treatment was associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and mortality when compared with other combination oral hypoglycemic agent treatments.
18752684:24	The mechanism for the apparent increase in myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes associated with RGZ remains uncertain.
18752684:25	In the PERISCOPE randomized controlled trial , using coronary intravascular ultrasonography, the authors found a significantly lower rate of progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients treated with pioglitazone when compared with glimiperide.
18752684:26	However, it is not possible to extend the positive or negative benefit of one drug to another in the same class.
18752684:27	In the next three years, we hope that the final results of the studies RECORD and BARI-2D , specifically evaluating cardiovascular effects of RGZ, will provide useful insights.
18752684:28	Conclusion 
The results of our study indicate that when rosiglitazone is administered in hypercholesterolemic rabbits before, but not after, undergoing vascular injury, there is significantly reduced neointimal formation.

21792364:1	Introduction 
Cancer chemoprevention is defined as the use of natural, synthetic or biologic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenic progression . There have been increasing safety concerns over synthetic chemopreventive therapy.
21792364:2	Commonly used synthetic antioxidants like butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxyltoluene (BHT) have been restricted due to their toxicity and DNA damage induction potential . Instead, floral resources have received considerable attention as sources of biologically active substances including antioxidants, anti-mutagens and anti-carcinogens . 

				 Rheum emodi Wall.
21792364:3	ex Meissn.
21792364:4	(Polygonaceae) is a leafy perennial herb distributed in altitudes ranging from 2800 to 3800 m in the temperate and subtropical regions of Himalayas from Kashmir to Sikkim in India . Roots of R. emodi are reported to have antibacterial and antifungal activities  . In addition several other biological activities such as laxative, diuretic, and in vivo inhibitory effect towards P388 leukemia in mice are also reported  .
21792364:5	The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant and anti-cancer potential of methanolic and aqueous extracts of R. emodi rhizome by various methods including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and •OH radical scavenging, Fe 3+ reducing capacity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in vitro which are rarely reported.
21792364:6	Cytotoxicity of the extracts were determined in MDA-MB-435S (human breast carcinoma) and Hep3B (liver carcinoma) cell lines.
21792364:7	The protective activity of the extracts was evaluated by UV induced photolysis of H 2O 2 leading to damage to pBR322 DNA.
21792364:8	Total phenolic content estimation was performed, and a few phenolic compounds that might be responsible for the antioxidant property of the extracts were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

4. Discussion 
Aqueous and methanolic extracts of R. emodi showed promising antioxidant activity in all the experimental models used.
21792364:12	Both extracts were found to have a dosage-dependent increase in their antioxidant potentials with varying degrees of efficiencies.
21792364:13	The differential scavenging activities of the extracts may be attributed to the varying mechanisms of radical scavenging in these assays.
21792364:14	The extracts were observed to be good scavengers of hydroxyl radical, which is involved in DNA crosslinkings and strand breaks, and is considered to be one of the quick initiators of lipid peroxidation . The ability of the extracts to quench hydroxyl radicals might directly relate to the prevention of lipid peroxidation.
21792364:15	It can be inferred that the extracts might prevent reactive radical species from damaging biomolecules such as lipoproteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, DNA, amino acids, proteins and sugars in biological systems . 
Both extracts showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity when tested in each of the two cancer cell lines.
21792364:16	According to the American National Cancer Institute, the IC 50 value to consider a crude extract promising for development of anti-cancer drug(s) is lower than a limit threshold of 30  μ g/ml . The extracts can thus serve as potential source for anti-cancer compounds.
21792364:17	The aqueous extract, on the other hand, although has lower potential as a cytotoxin, shows considerable degree of DNA protection against oxidative damage, while its methanolic counterpart holistically lacks this property.
21792364:18	These differences can be attributed to the presence of differential protective metabolites eluted out in the two solvents, and also due to factors like stereoselectivity and/or solubility of the two extracts . Both extracts were therefore found to have promising potential towards the development of drugs that might be used to target tumors for chemoprevention/chemotherapy to check neoplastic growth and malignancy.
21792364:19	A significant ( P < .05) positive correlation was extrapolated between the results of the assay for estimation of total phenolic content and those investigating other therapeutic parameters.
21792364:20	In view of this, HPLC analysis was performed to identify some of the major phenolic compounds in both extracts.
21792364:21	However, we accomplished in identifying major polyphenols only in the methanolic extract.
21792364:22	The antioxidant, cytotoxicity and DNA protection abilities of the extracts render them suitable to be considered as a source for the development of anti-cancer drugs.
21792364:23	In tumor cells, ROS is produced extensively, which thereby increases levels of certain growth factors and enzymes like metalloproteinases (MMPs) which promote angiogenesis, and also elevates the risk of metastasis and development of secondary tumors . Antioxidant properties of the extracts might therefore prevent progression of cancer; while the cytotoxic potential, on the other hand, might be used against cancer cells, thereby directing them towards apoptosis and cell death.
21792364:24	DNA protection property might hold good in inhibiting secondary mutations in progressive tumor tissues.
21792364:25	5.
21792364:26	Conclusion 
Rhizome of R. emodi might be a potential source for anti-cancer metabolites which can be mustered for the development of effective cancer drugs.
21792364:27	Isolation and characterization of compounds from R. emodi rhizome extracts are in prospect.

21673887:0	Introduction 
Many bacteria that have been isolated from marine environments can synthesize a variety of carotenoid pigments . For example, acyclic C 30-type carotenoic acids were identified in some marine bacteria such as Planococcus maritimus  and Rubritalea squalenifaciens . Algoriphagus sp.
21673887:1	KK10202C of the Flexibacteraceae family, which was isolated from a marine sponge, was found to produce flexixanthin ((3 S )-3,1′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-didehydro-1′2′-dihydro-β,ψ-caroten-4-one) and deoxyflexixanthin (1′-hydroxy-3′,4′-didehydro-1′2′-dihydro-β,ψ-caroten-4-one) , which are C 40-type monocyclic carotenoids containing one β-end group (β ring) (called monocyclic carotenoids in this review).
21673887:2	Other marine bacteria including strain P99-3, which belong to the Flavobacteriaceae family, were shown to produce monocyclic carotenoids, myxol ((3 R ,2′ S )-3′,4′-didehydro-1′,2′-dihydro-β,ψ-carotene-3,1′,2′-triol) and saproxanthin ((3 R )-3′,4′-didehydro-1′,2′-dihydro-β,ψ-carotene-3,1′-diol), and zeaxanthin ((3 R ,3′ R )-β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol) , which are a C 40-type dicyclic carotenoid containing two β-end groups (called dicyclic carotenids in this review).
21673887:3	Marine bacteria belonging to genus Paracoccus Brevundimonas or Erythrobacter in the α -Proteobacteria class have been revealed to synthesize dicyclic carotenoids that are ketolated at the 4(4′)-position(s) (called ketocarotenoids), e.g., astaxanthin ((3 S ,3′ S )-3,3′-dihydroxy-β,β-carotene-4,4′-dione) and adonixanthin ((3 S ,3′ R )-3,3′-dyhydroxy-β,β-caroten-4-one)  .
21673887:4	Among ketocarotenoids, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin (β,β-carotene-4,4′-dione) (specifically the former), are commercially important pigments as nutraceuticals and cosmetics that have anti-oxidation and anti-aging effects as well as colorants in aquaculture, while other ketocarotenoids are likely to have industrial potentials  .
21673887:5	This review focuses on carotenoid β-ring 4(4′)-ketolase (4-oxygenase), carotenoid β-ring 3(3′)-hydroxylase, and carotenoid β-ring 2(2′)-hydroxylase, derived from the marine bacteria that belong to α -Proteobacteria and pathway engineering for the production of functional xanthophylls via the incorporation of these β-ring-modifying enzyme genes.
21673887:6	Bacterial Strains Producing Ketocarotenoids 
Paracoccus sp.
21673887:7	strain N81106 (NBRC 101723), isolated from surface seawater near Aka island, Okinawa, Japan, was first shown to produce astaxanthin in bacteria .
21673887:8	This bacterium was also found to synthesize adonixanthin, adonixanthin β- d-glucoside, and astaxanthin β- d-glucoside . Paracoccus haeundaesis BC74171 T, isolated from the Haeundae Coast, Korea, was shown to produce astaxanthin mainly . Paracoccus marinus KKL-A5 T (NBRC 100637 T), isolated from coastal seawater in Tokyo Bay, Japan, was found to produce adonixanthin diglucoside predominantly . On the other hands, a marine bacterium Brevundimona s sp. strain SD212 (NBRC 101024) was revealed to synthesize not only astaxanthin and adonixanthin but also their 2(2′)-hydroxylated metabolites, that is, 2-hydroxyastaxanthin ((2 R ,3 S ,3′ S )-2,3,3′-trihydroxy-β,β-carotene-4,4′-dione), 2-hydroxyadonixanthin ((2 R ,3 S ,3′ R )-2,3,3′-trihydroxy-β,β-caroten-4-one), erythroxanthin ((3 S ,2′ R ,3′ R )-3,2′,3′-trihydroxy-β,β-caroten-4-one), 4-ketonostoxanthin ((2 R ,3 S ,2′ R ,3′ R )-2,3,2′,3′-tetrahydroxy-β,β-caroten-4-one) and 2,2′-dyhydroxyastaxanthin ((2 R ,3 S ,2′ R ,3′ S )-2,3,2′,3′-tetrahydroxy-β,β-carotene-4,4′-dione) . shows the structures of the ketocarotenoids shown in this section and their feasible biosynthetic pathway.
21673887:9	shows phylogenetic tree of the marine bacteria that produce astaxanthin and other ketocarotenoids, which were isolated in Marine biotechnology Institute (Kamaishi, Japan), along with the type strains relative to these bacteria, many of which are not marine bacteria but soil bacteria.
21673887:10	Interestingly, the phylogenetically closest strains to the marine bacteria Paracoccus sp.
21673887:11	N81106 and Brevundimona s sp.
21673887:12	SD212 were soil bacteria Paracoccus marcusii DSM 11574 T  and Brevundimonas aurantiaca ATCC 15266 T, respectively.
21673887:13	Ketocarotenoid Biosynthesis Genes 
Genes required for the biosynthesis of dicyclic carotenoids were first isolated from soil bacteria Pantoea ananatis (reclassified from Erwinia uredovora )  and Pantoea agglomerans ( Erwinia herbicola ) , which cannot produce ketocarotenoids and belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family of class γ -Proteobacteria (the same family to Escherichia coli ).
21673887:14	The Pantoea carotenoid biosynthesis genes composed a gene cluster for the synthesis of zeaxanthin β- d-diglucoside from farnesyl diphosphate (farnesyl pyrophosphate; FPP)  , and comprised six genes that encode geranygeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase (CrtE) , phytoene synthase (CrtB) , phytoene desaturase (CrtI) , lycopene (ψ,ψ-carotene) β-cyclase (CrtY) , β-carotene (β,β-carotene) 3-hydrocylase (CrtZ) , and zeaxanthin glucosyltransferase (CrtX) . 
These crt genes have widely used for complementation analysis of carotenoid biosynthesis genes isolated from other organisms, since they are functionally expressed in E. coli with ease  . The P. agglomerans gene cluster contained a gene encoding isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase (Idi; type 2)  in addition to the six crt genes . These seven carotenogenic (carotenoid-biosynthetic) genes were also found to exist in a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster of Paracoccus sp.
21673887:15	strain N81106 . This cluster included an additional gene, designated CrtW, which was elucidated to code for an enzyme responsible for ketocarotenoid formation, that is, CrtW proved to catalyze the synthesis of canthaxanthin from β-carotene by complementation analysis using recombinant E. coli cells that contains the P. ananatis crtE crtB crtI and crtY genes . The hydropathy and transmembrane prediction analyses indicated that CrtW from Paracoccus sp.
21673887:16	N81106 contains four transmembrane domains and two other hydrophobic regions, and its topology model is very similar to those for fatty acid desaturases .
21673887:17	It should be noted that it is recalcitrant to purify active CrtW and CrtZ proteins, which both are very likely iron-dependent integral membrane proteins, from the recombinant hosts as well as the native hosts, precluding their close enzymatic characterizations.
21673887:18	Carotenoid 4,4′-Ketolase 
It has been revealed that only two enzymes, carotenoid 4,4′-ketolase (4,4′-oxygenase) (β-ring 4(4′)-ketolase; CrtW) and carotenoid 3,3′-hydroxylase (β-ring 3(3′)-hydroxylase; CrtZ), are sufficient to biosynthesize astaxanthin from β-carotene via eight intermediates including zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin and adonixanthin [ , ].
21673887:19	CrtW can convert not only the (un-substituted) β ring but also the 3-hydroxylated β ring into the respective 4-ketolated groups, and CrtZ can convert not only the (un-substituted) β ring but also the 4-ketolated β-ring into the respective 3-hydroxylated groups, as shown in  .
21673887:20	An in vitro analysis with the crude enzymes of CrtW and CrtZ from the E. coli cells expressing the corresponding genes indicated that these enzymes are likely 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate)-dependent dioxygenases . 
The crtW genes were present not only in the above-mentioned α -Proteobacteria but also in the marine bacterium Algoriphagus sp.
21673887:21	KK10202C  and cyanobacterial strains such as Anabaena ( Nostoc ) sp.
21673887:22	PCC 7120 and N. punctiforme . These cyanobacteria produced not astaxanthin but echinenone (β,β-caroten-4-one), and 4-ketomyxol 2′-fucoside, a monocyclic carotenoid that includes the 4-ketolated β-ring . Conversion efficiency to astaxanthin in several CrtWs was compared with recombinant E. coli cells that synthesize the carotenoid substrate zeaxanthin due to the presence of the P. ananatis crtE crtB crtI crtY and crtZ genes, in which each crtW gene from Paracoccus sp.
21673887:23	N81106, Paracoccus sp.
21673887:24	PC1, Brevundimona s sp.
21673887:25	SD212, Anabaena sp.
21673887:26	PCC7120, and N. punctiforme was expressed .
21673887:27	It was consequently shown that the Brevundimona s sp.
21673887:28	SD212 CrtW, which exhibited the highest amino acid identity (96.3%) with that of the B. aurantiaca ATCC 15266 CrtW (accession no.
21673887:29	AY166610), converted β-carotene to astaxanthin with the highest efficiency, along with the P. ananatis CrtZ . In the case of the Paracoccus CrtWs, not only astaxanthin but also adonixanthin tended to accumulate, and this intermediate was difficult to be converted to astaxanthin . The cyanobacterial CrtWs poorly converted zeaxanthin to astaxanthin via adonixanthin . 
Two paralogous genes exhibiting significant homology to crtW were isolated from H. pluvialis and designated bkt  or crtO . These genes were renamed bkt1 from crtO and bkt2 from bkt since “ crtO ” has been used for the other type of cyanobacterial β-ring 4(4′)-ketolase genes, as shown later . The BKT1 and BKT2 enzymes are very likely to have catalytic function same to the Paracoccus (or Brevundimonas ) CrtWs, considering results from the in vitro study on BKT2 with E. coli  and pathway engineering researches in higher plants as well as E. coli as the hosts [ , ].
21673887:30	A gene encoding a new type of β-ring 4(4′)-ketolase (named CrtO) that showed apparent homology not to CrtW-type ketolase but to CrtI-type phytoene desaturase was first found in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
21673887:31	strain PCC 6803 , which produced 3′-hydroxyechinenone (3′-hydroxy-β,β-caroten-4-one), zeaxanthin and myxol 2′-dimethyl-fucoside . The crtO genes were also present in Anabaena sp.
21673887:32	PCC 7120 , and an actinomycete Rhodococcus erythropolis and Deinococcus radiodurans R1 highly resistant to γ and UV radiation , which produced other monocyclic carotenoids, e.g., the latter strain produced deinoxanthin (2,1′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-didehydro-1′2′-dihydro-β,ψ-caroten-4-one) .
21673887:33	An in vivo analysis on crtO was performed with recombinant E. coli cells that synthesize the carotenoid substrate β-carotene or zeaxanthin, into which each crtO gene from Synechocystis sp.
21673887:34	PCC 6803 and R. erythropolis was introduced and expressed there .
21673887:35	This result along with previous finding  suggested that the CrtO-type of β-ring 4(4′)-ketolases can accept only the (un-substituted) β ring(s) in β-carotene and probably in monocyclic carotenoids as the substrates.
21673887:36	Carotenoid 3,3′-Hydroxylase 
The crtZ genes have been found not only in carotenogenic bacteria belonging to genera Pantoea Paracoccus and Brevundimonas but also in those belonging to the Flavobacteriaceae family .
21673887:37	Conversion efficiency to astaxanthin in several CrtZs was compared with recombinant E. coli cells that synthesize the carotenoid substrate canthaxanthin due to the presence of the P. ananatis crtE crtB crtI and crtY gens, and the Paracoccus N81106 crtW gene, into which each crtZ gene from P. ananatis Paracoccus sp.
21673887:38	N81106, Paracoccus sp.
21673887:39	PC1, Brevundimona s sp.
21673887:40	SD212, and marine bacterium strain P99-3 of the Flavobacteriacea family was introduced and expressed there .
21673887:41	It was consequently shown that the CrtZ enzymes from Brevundimona s sp.
21673887:42	SD212 and the bacterial strain P99-3 converted β-carotene to astaxanthin with the highest and lowest efficiency, respectively, along with the Paracoccus N81106 CrtW . 
On the other hands, no crtZ sequences have not been found in cyanobacteria, instead genes encoding a new type of β-ring 3(3′)-hydroxylases (named CrtR) that exhibited moderate homology to CrtW have been found there . The crtR genes were isolated from Synechocystis sp.

21673887:44	PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis and N. punctiforme .
21673887:45	An in vivo analysis on crtR was performed with recombinant E. coli cells that synthesize the carotenoid substrate β-carotene or canthaxanthin, into which each crtR gene from Synechocystis sp.

21673887:49	This result along with another result  indicated that the CrtR-type enzymes can hydroxylate the (un-substituted) β ring of monocyclic carotenoids such as deoxymyxol and deoxymyxol 2′-fucoside at the 3 position.
21673887:50	Among them, only the Synechocystis sp.
21673887:51	PCC 6803CrtR was able to convert β-carotene to zeaxanthin [ , ].
21673887:52	A thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27, which grows at temperatures above 75 °C, was found to possess another new type of β-ring 3(3′)-hydroxylase of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, named CYP175A1 . The in vivo analysis with the gene strongly suggested that this thermostable P450 accepts only the (un-substituted) β ring of β-carotene as the substrate to form zeaxanthin . 
Carotenoid 2,2′-Hydroxylase 
Carotenoid 2,2′-hydroxylase (β-ring 2(2′)-hydroxylase) was first found in the marine bacterium Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:53	strain SD212, and named CrtG . An in vivo analysis on crtG was performed with recombinant E. coli cells that synthesize each carotenoid substrate (β-carotene, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, or astaxanthin), into which the crtG gene was introduced and expressed there . The result indicated that the CrtG can hydroxylate the β rings substituted with 3-hydroxy and/or 4-keto groups in dicyclic carotenoids at the 2(2′)-positions ( and ) . The crtG genes were also isolated from soil bacteria Brevundimonas vesicularis DC263 and B. aurantiaca ATCC 15266 . The in vivo analysis with these genes indicated that the B. aurantiaca CrtG enzyme (accession no.
21673887:54	DQ497427), which exhibited the highest amino acid identity (98.8%) to that of the Brevundimonas SD212 CrtG, accepted the (un-substituted) β rings of β-carotene in addition to the substituted β rings as the substrates . A crtG gene sequence, whose encoded amino acid sequence was 41% identical to the Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:55	SD212 CrtG, was found in a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus which synthesized 2-hydroxylated carotenoids such as caloxanthin ((2 R ,3 R ,3′ R )-β,β-carotene-2,3,3′-triol), nostoxanthin ((2 R ,3 R ,2′ R ,3′ R )-β,β-carotene-2,3,2′,3′-tetrol), and 2-hydroxymyxol 2′-fucoside . 
Pathway Engineering for the Synthesis of Functional Xanthophylls via the Incorporation of crtW crtZ and/or crtG Genes 
 shows xanthophylls that were produced in recombinant E. coli cells via the incorporation of the marine bacterial crtW crtZ and/or crtG genes along with the Pantoea crtE crtB crtI and crtY genes.
21673887:56	The recombinant E. coli strain that expresses the four Pantoea crt genes can produce β-carotene predominantly (approximately 0.2–1 mg·g −1 dry cell weight).
21673887:57	The coexpression of the crtW crtZ and/or crtG genes in the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli cells confer the ability to produce not only commercially important xanthophylls such as astaxanthin but also xanthophylls minor in nature (e.g., β-ring(s)-2(2′)-hydroxylated carotenoids), which are difficult to synthesize chemically.
21673887:58	Particularly, the chemical synthesis of 2(2′)-hydroxycarotenoids are likely to be recalcitrant, due to high-density around the 1,2-positions of the β ring in these xanthophylls.
21673887:59	We showed that the coexpression of the Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:60	SD212 crtW gene and the P. ananatis crtZ gene in the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli due to the presence of the four crt genes of P. ananatis resulted in predominant production of astaxanthin . The Paracoccus sp.
21673887:61	N81106 crtW gene was evolved by random mutagenesis to have improved activity . It is also demonstrated that the coexpression of the crtW gene and the crtG gene from Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:62	SD212 or from B. aurantiaca ATCC 15266 in the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli resulted in dominant production of 2,2′-dihydroxycanthaxanthin and 2-hydroxycanthaxanthin, while the substrate canthaxanthin accumulated . The coexpression of the crtZ gene and the crtG gene in the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli resulted in predominant production of nostoxanthin along with small amounts of caloxanthin . The coexpression of all the three genes ( crtW crtZ and crtG ) in the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli resulted in dominant production of 2,2′-dihydroxyastaxanthin and 2-hydroxyastaxanthin . When the P. ananatis crtX gene was coexpressed in addition to appropriate combinations of the above crt genes in E. coli resultant E. coli cells were able to synthesize carotenoid-glycosides such as caloxanthin β- d-glucoside  and astaxanthin β- d-diglucoside , as shown in .
21673887:63	The γ-ray-tolerant bacterium D. radiodurans R1 produces the monocyclic carotenoid including the 2-hydroxy-4-keto-β-ring, deinoxanthin . 2,2′-Dihydroxycanthaxanthin was shown to have strong inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation in a rat brain homogenate . Such minor ketocarotenoids, which include the 2-hydroxy-4-keto-β-ring, may have beneficial effects on human health as well as anti-oxidation function, while few works are present examining their biological functions.
21673887:64	When carotenoid biosynthesis genes starting from the utilization of FPP are introduced in E. coli as above-mentioned, amounts of carotenoids produced with the recombinant E. coli cells are far from the practical use, which was difficult to exceed 1 mg·g −1 dry weight.
21673887:65	In order to overcome this problem, many pathway engineering researches in E. coli have been performed for increasing intracellular concentration of FPP (e.g., recently reviewed ).
21673887:66	For example, the coexpression of the idi (type 1) gene from H. pluvialis Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (renamed from Phaffia rhodozyma ), or Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the idi (type 2) from Streptomyces sp.
21673887:67	strain CL190, was shown to be effective to increase FPP content . The introduction of heterologous mevalonate pathway genes in E. coli along with an idi (type 2) gene has been described to efficiently improve the productivity of carotenoids or sesquiterpenes that are synthesized from FPP  . For example, Yoon et al.  produced 22 mg·g −1 dry cell weight of lycopene in 72 h using such mevalonate-pathway-engineered E. coli cells.
21673887:68	On the other hand, production of lycopene reached high levels (near to 20 mg·g −1 dry cell weight) in 24-h batch flask culture in pathway-engineered E. coli which reflected results of multi-dimensional gene target search or gene-knockout analysis .
21673887:69	These finding should be applied to efficient production of the above-mentioned functional xanthophylls with E. coli cells.
21673887:70	Pathway engineering researches in higher plants have also been performed for efficient production of astaxanthin, which utilized the marine bacterial crtW genes from Paracoccus sp.
21673887:71	N81106 or Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:72	SD212, or the H. pluvialis bkt1 or bkt2 genes, as reviewed [ , ].
21673887:73	For example, the Brevundimonas sp.
21673887:74	SD212 crtW and crtZ genes, whose nucleotide sequence is modified to codon usage of higher plants, were successfully overexpressed in the chloroplasts of tobacco plants ( Nicotiana tabacum ), and astaxanthin level produce there reached 5.44 mg·g −1 dry weight (74% of total carotenoids) . 
Conclusions 
This review has focused on the carotenoid β-ring-modifying enzymes, CrtW, CrtZ and CrtG, derived from the marine bacteria of the α- Proteobacteria class, and pathway engineering for the production of xanthophylls in E. coli using these enzyme genes.
21673887:75	Such pathway engineering researches are performed towards efficient production not only of commercially important xanthophylls such as astaxanthin, but also of xanthophylls minor in nature, which are difficult to synthesize chemically, and expected to have beneficial effects on human health as well as anti-oxidation function.

20184771:0	Background 
The use of physical restraints still is common practice in the nursing home care of older people with dementia.
20184771:1	Physical restraints are defined as any limitation in an individual's freedom of movement  and includes those worn by the person (belt, chest, and arm/leg), those attached to beds (full-enclosure bedrails) or chairs (locked table).
20184771:2	Although reports of restraint prevalence internationally varies from 15 to 66% , ranges of restraint prevalence in Dutch nursing homes is between 41 to 64% . Recent prevalence measures in the Netherlands have shown that 10% to 14% of nursing home residents are restrained with belts . 
Staff report that physical restraints are used to prevent falls [ - ].
20184771:3	The accumulating evidence that restraint reduction does not lead to an increased number of falls or fall-related injuries [ - ] and that restraint use can result in falls and problems with balance and coordination [ , ], call into question the continued use of these devices as "safety measures".
20184771:4	Restraints have other known negative physical, psychological and social consequences for older persons.
20184771:5	Both prolonged and short periods of physical restraint use are associated with pressure sores, loss of muscle strength and endurance, joint contractures, incontinence, demoralization, humiliation feelings of low self worth, depression, aggression and impaired social functioning [ , ].
20184771:6	Evans and colleagues  conducted a systematic review of physical restraint use in acute and residential health care facilities, and documented that the use of physical restraints (including belts), increases the risk of death, serious injury, as well as the length of hospital stay.
20184771:7	Older adults report negative feelings about the restraint experience such as discomfort and indifference . The use of restraints may also indicate a failure to address the real needs of the residents.
20184771:8	Since physical restraints have been shown to be an ineffective and sometimes even hazardous measure, interventions are needed to reduce their usage.
20184771:9	Several attempts have been made to reduce restraint use in clinical practice [ - ].
20184771:10	Most interventions used educational approaches, aiming to improve nursing staff knowledge and confidence to avoid physical restraints and to use alternative measures that target the resident's underlying problems [ , ].
20184771:11	These intensive training sessions were delivered to staff by a nurse specialist provided to the nursing home as a consultant from the study team.
20184771:12	The success rate of these interventions differs between countries; a successful educational intervention in the USA  proved to be ineffective in the Netherlands [ , ].
20184771:13	It is unclear whether these contradictory results can be explained by cultural differences, differences in health care systems, or difference in educational level of nursing staff in nursing homes between the USA and the Netherlands.
20184771:14	The results of a recent study among Dutch, German and Swiss nursing staff indicate that opinions and attitudes towards physical restraints hinder attempts to reduce restraint use . In this study, almost all nursing staff assessed the use of physical restraints in their clinical practice as appropriate.
20184771:15	Moreover, Dutch nursing staff consistently assessed restraint measures as less restrictive than German and Swiss nursing staff and reported less discomfort in using restraints . Furthermore, this and other studies indicate that the availability of alternative interventions is essential for effective restraint reduction [ - ].
20184771:16	For instance, in the study by Huizing and colleagues it was reported that the availability of some new and rather expensive alternative measures was limited .
20184771:17	Finally, there are indications that legislation influences the use of restraints; the success of the educational intervention in the USA has also been supported by a nursing home law that led to national nursing home regulations (OBRA '87) that discourage restraint use . In the Netherlands, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports in 2009 has introduced a bill in Parliament ("Wet Zorg en Dwang") that regulates the use of physical restraints in people with dementia in general and belts in particular.
20184771:18	According to this bill, the usage of belts to prevent falls will no longer be allowed . The proposed changes in legislation provide an opportunity to develop a multi-component intervention tailored to the Dutch nursing home environment that will assist facilities in meeting this new requirement.
20184771:19	Among restraints used in Dutch nursing homes, belts are the most restrictive measure  therefore our intervention program, named EXBELT, primarily focuses on belt use reduction .
20184771:20	The EXBELT intervention includes four components: (1) promotion of institutional policy change that discourages belt restraint use, (2) education, (3) consultation by a nurse specialist, and (4) development and availability of alternative interventions.
20184771:21	Cultural differences in staff opinions is an important consideration for the development of effective interventions.
20184771:22	The educational component (including strategies for changing attitudes) for nursing home staff (physicians, nurses, paramedical staff and psychologist) is based on the intervention developed by Evans and colleagues  and Huizing and colleagues [ - ] that is customized for Dutch nursing home staff.
20184771:23	In 2007, EXBELT was developed and piloted in one nursing home ward . The results of this pilot study were very promising.
20184771:24	At baseline, 12 belts in 30 residents were used.
20184771:25	After one month follow up, no belt was used, but after three and nine months follow up 1 belt was used.
20184771:26	This reduction in belt use did not result in either an increase in the number of falls and related injuries or the use of other restrictive measures such as chairs with a locked tray table or psychoactive medication.
20184771:27	Belts were replaced with, resident-centered interventions, such as movement and balance training, lower beds, hip protectors, extra supervision and monitoring devices (video camera, sensor mat, and infrared alarm systems).
20184771:28	The recent expansion of the pilot (in 2008) to other wards in the same nursing home has shown similar results.
20184771:29	However, this home does not represent a typical Dutch facility since it is considered as 'best practice' regarding restraint reduction initiatives and research.
20184771:30	Thus, further testing of the EXBELT intervention is needed on wards in other nursing homes prior to widespread dissemination.
20184771:31	Study aim and research questions 
The first aim of this study is to further develop and test the effectiveness of a tailored multi-component intervention program (EXBELT) on belt restraint reduction in Dutch psychogeriatric nursing homes.
20184771:32	However, the reduction of belts should not result in an increase of other restrictive restraints (such as a chair with locked tray table) or psychoactive drug use.
20184771:33	The overall aim is an effective and feasible intervention that can be employed on a large scale in Dutch nursing homes.
20184771:34	We translated the aims into the following eight specific research questions: 
1.
20184771:35	Does a tailored multi-component intervention (EXBELT) result in the reduction of belts in nursing homes?
20184771:36	2.
20184771:37	Does EXBELT prevent the use of belts in newly admitted residents?
20184771:38	3.
20184771:39	Does EXBELT reduce the use of other types of physical restraints?
20184771:40	4.
20184771:41	Does belt elimination result in an increase of falls and fall related injuries?
20184771:42	5.
20184771:43	What resident centered alternative interventions are used in EXBELT?
20184771:44	6. What is the opinion of nursing home staff, management and residents' relatives about EXBELT and the effectiveness of alternative interventions?
20184771:45	7. What are indicators for successful or unsuccessful implementation of EXBELT?
20184771:46	8. What improvements (related to content, organization and monitoring) are necessary to optimize the effect of EXBELT?

19697133:0	Introduction 
This is a particularly interesting and challenging time in the health promotion and disease prevention field: On the research-driven side, the U.S. government has mandated the use of empirically-supported programs at all schools and major efforts are underway to promote the diffusion and high-fidelity implementation of empirically-supported programs.
19697133:1	On the community-driven side, multiple funding agencies now require community advisory boards for intervention research.
19697133:2	The NIH, in its funding of community-partnered processes, proposed that these approaches have the potential to develop more effective interventions by: Increasing relevance of intervention approaches and thus likelihood for success; targeting interventions to the identified needs of community members; and developing intervention strategies that incorporate community norms into scientifically valid approaches (National Institutes of Health ).
19697133:3	Thus, there is strong recognition of the value of high-fidelity implementation of empirically-supported programs and a growing recognition of the need for local stakeholders to be involved in the planning and contextual adaptation of programs that serve them.
19697133:4	Leaders in prevention science have called for further integration of community and research-driven approaches for maximal intervention effectiveness and sustainability and have highlighted the need for more scientific inquiry in the largely neglected but fundamentally important areas of contextual influences on program effectiveness and diffusion (Biglan et al. ; Gray et al. ; Wandersman and Florin ; Weissberg and Greenberg ).
19697133:5	A central issue in the local adaptation of programs is the extent to which changes strengthen or undermine the “active ingredients” or core components of the program.
19697133:6	Adaptations that are consistent with program theory would generally not be considered a problem, unlike those that undermine the core components (Greenberg ).
19697133:7	Despite interest in pursuing a “best of both” integration of prevention science and community-collaborative approaches, there is surprisingly little empirical research to guide such efforts.
19697133:8	While advocates of participatory approaches assert that the input of local stakeholders in intervention planning and implementation is essential, we know little about the adaptations local stakeholders suggest or enact, and if these adaptations would be expected to strengthen or weaken interventions.
19697133:9	Further, although youth and their behavior are frequently the target of prevention programming, interventions are typically designed and implemented by adults.
19697133:10	Thus, the perspective of youth regarding the interventions delivered to them represents an under-utilized resource in prevention programming and adaptation.
19697133:11	Major theoretical frameworks underlying health promotion and prevention programs highlight the importance of motivation for change and the personal relevance of the health behavior and outcomes for the individual (e.g. Bandura ; Fisher and Misovich ).
19697133:12	Therefore, local adaptations that enhance perceived relevance for youth may improve effectiveness if they do not undermine core program components.
19697133:13	To help address gaps in the field, the present study provides a primarily qualitative in-depth investigation of the diffusion of two empirically-supported prevention programs for high school students in four ethnically-diverse urban schools.
19697133:14	We explore three main questions regarding implementation in these settings: First, what changes does a select group of experienced teachers make as they implement these two empirically-supported violence and substance abuse programs, and why?
19697133:15	Second, when asked to reflect on the program, what adaptations do teachers and youth suggest to make it maximally effective?
19697133:16	Third, to what extent are these changes suggested by students and teachers consistent with program theory?
19697133:17	Our study is designed to generate insights and hypotheses regarding the practices that influence implementation and adaptation in these settings rather than to test claims of evidence more generally (Biglan ; Biglan et al. ).
19697133:18	Our report offers evidence to support theory-building in the nascent field of “Type II” translational research (Rohrbach et al. ). 
Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
This study used qualitative methods to extend our understanding of the diffusion of empirically-supported prevention programs in two main areas.
19697133:19	First, using sensitizing concepts from existing conceptual frameworks, we identified the kinds of adaptations made by competent and experienced teachers in four urban, ethnically-diverse high schools as they implemented empirically-supported prevention programs in their classrooms, and their rationale for these changes.
19697133:20	Second, we elicited and systematically analyzed the feedback of teachers and students regarding how to maximize the effectiveness of these two programs in preventing drug abuse and violence, assessing the extent to which suggestions by these two key stakeholder groups were consistent with the core components of the program as articulated by the program developers.
19697133:21	Our findings regarding teachers’ adaptations to programs indicate that all teachers made adaptations to their respective programs, in line with prior observational research on Life Skills Training implemented in middle school settings (Dusenbury et al. ). Here, we observed that teachers’ most frequent adaptations involved changing the instructional format of the curricular activities to “work” with what they perceived to be the learning needs or interests of their students, illustrating the curriculum with real-life examples, or altering the wording.
19697133:22	With respect to the adaptations to the curricula suggested by students and teachers, we found that these two groups were equally likely to suggest theoretically- and logistically-acceptable adaptations as judged by the program developers.
19697133:23	Not surprisingly, students tended to suggest “surface” adaptations to make the substance abuse curricula (TND) even more realistic and engaging for their age and cultural backgrounds.
19697133:24	The majority of these surface-level changes were judged to be theoretically acceptable by the program developers.
19697133:25	Students’ requests for content, however, were more theoretically-ambivalent when content included learning about positive aspects of drug use that raised program developers’ concerns regarding deviancy training, or that the program might be erroneously viewed as taking a harm reduction stance.
19697133:26	While almost all of the teachers’ proposed adaptations appeared to reflect reasonable educational practices in terms of engaging students and promoting their learning of relevant concepts, some suggestions entailed the use of health education strategies that are not empirically-supported (e.g. looking at tar to show the effects of smoking on the lungs).
19697133:27	This tension between teaching practices viewed as effective by teachers and the recommendations of research studies has been demonstrated in prior observational studies of middle school health education (Hansen and McNeal ) and may be particularly accentuated in the current U.S. educational climate focused on the accountability of teachers regarding specific knowledge standards.
19697133:28	But while Hansen et al.’s earlier research indicated that middle school teachers tended not to use interactive lessons shown to be most effective in health promotion, the high school teachers in this study primarily sought to increase the interactivity of the lessons while also suggesting more of a focus on knowledge transmission regarding drugs and their consequences.
19697133:29	The strong teachers in our sample viewed good teaching in part as directly connecting with students and making the material “their own” by tailoring and improvising activities to best meet their perceptions of their students’ needs.
19697133:30	Beyond the capacity-related challenges encountered in the scaling up of empirically-supported prevention programs in urban schools discussed extensively in the prevention science literature, the present study identifies a set of practice-related tensions among this group of competent and experienced teachers in ethnically-diverse urban high schools that raise new questions with meaningful implications for diffusion practice and future research efforts.
19697133:31	The implementations studied here reflect the intersection of prevention science, secondary school education, and health education.
19697133:32	Future research should explore if and how practice-based pulls for adaptation observed here are evident in other districts and with other kinds of prevention curricula, and examine the value of engaging teachers in collegial dialogue as part of the diffusion of empirically-supported programs.
19697133:33	Another key step is to examine contextual processes at the district, state, and national levels that provide a “press” on teacher and students within the prevention system (Wandersman et al. ).
19697133:34	The existing literature on implementation and adaptation in school-based prevention has primarily emphasized middle schools and substance abuse prevention.
19697133:35	The present study’s focus on high schools is of particular theoretical interest because high school students are further along in the trajectory of some risk behaviors, there are fewer universal prevention programs to serve them, and far fewer that have been shown to be effective.
19697133:36	For example, TND is the only universal program for high schools that meets the most rigorous criteria as a model program in the Blueprints system, and TND and TGDV are among the small number of model programs for high schools in the SAMHSA system.
19697133:37	This shortage of empirically-supported violence and substance abuse prevention programs for older adolescents suggests that programs will be delivered to highly diverse populations.
19697133:38	Further, because older adolescents are more likely to have experience with risk behaviors, engaging them may be more challenging and their teachers may face more pulls to adapt programs to make them relevant.
19697133:39	The present study is the first to our knowledge to systematically investigate the consistency of local stakeholders’ suggestions with the core components of the program.
19697133:40	Our findings that high school students provided meaningful and, for the most part, theoretically-consistent suggestions to enhance the effectiveness and relevance of the programs implemented in their school has several implications.
19697133:41	First, many of the students’ “surface” suggestions did not affect the core activities of the program and raised little in the way of theoretical or logistical concerns.
19697133:42	Some of these minor changes, however, were viewed by students as critical in terms of how they perceived the program as being interesting versus, in their words, “boring” or “for little kids.” Major theoretical frameworks that guide many prevention efforts emphasize the importance of engagement and perceived relevance as critical to social learning (Bandura ), raising the possibility that flexibility in implementation that allows students’ “green light” changes could potentially strengthen effectiveness.
19697133:43	Strengths of this study include the extensive naturalistic observations of the two prevention programs as they were implemented by teachers, the integration of multiple methods for data gathering and analysis, and rigorous attention to increasing the “trustworthiness” of the findings by taking systematic steps to establish the reliability of the analysis among coders and the validity of our interpretation of data (Patton ).
19697133:44	It should be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that the presence of observers in the classroom may have influenced the implementation despite our extensive efforts at maintaining a neutral stance.
19697133:45	Despite this risk of expectancy effects with observational methods, prior research suggests that this approach yields more sensitive and valid data about teachers’ program implementation (Dusenbury et al. ).
19697133:46	Although we used quantitative techniques to extend our thematic analyses, the present study did not seek to make generalizable claims about our processes of interest in the larger population of schools.
19697133:47	Rather, our purposive sampling strategy was designed to study the higher end of implementation quality in two ethnically diverse urban districts in a particular context and time.
19697133:48	Accordingly, we selected teachers who had been trained in the curriculum and were expected to implement it well.
19697133:49	Further, these curricula were taught as part of semester-long health classes.
19697133:50	Thus, teachers’ time spent on the curriculum was not in direct competition with academic instruction; we might see more dropping of sessions if this were the case.
19697133:51	While these conditions likely enhanced adherence, it is also possible that health teachers are more likely to resist new health curricula than would typical teachers.
19697133:52	Several teachers reported that they used time after the implementation of the empirically-supported curriculum to supplement it with activities that have not been empirically-tested.
19697133:53	This may account for our findings that teachers suggested the need for additional content and socio-cultural adaptations but were not observed to make many of these adaptations within the mandated curricula.
19697133:54	The patterns of suggested and enacted adaptations found for the two specific prevention programs studied here may not generalize to other prevention programs or to other types of educational and social interventions in schools.
19697133:55	Programs differ on characteristics that could influence local fit and pulls for adaptation including theoretical grounding, delivery approaches, and the flexibility permitted in implementation.
19697133:56	Ideally, future studies of other programs and settings will help to generate a broader knowledge base to enable meta-analytic investigation of questions generated here.
19697133:57	As it is unlikely that any one program can use wording and examples that will be perceived as relevant to all adolescents, specifying the parameters that practitioners can use to modify their programs without undermining core components is critical (Dusenbury et al. ). Evidence “farming,” a process in medicine that describes the integration of practitioners’ clinical experiences into a more systematic knowledge base to supplement evidence from randomized clinical trials (Hay et al. ), provides a model that may be of use to dissemination science in the school-based prevention area.
19697133:58	It is also important to note that eliciting and responding to teenagers’ perspectives on programs where feasible could provide benefits because control is particularly salient for motivation in adolescence (Eccles et al. ). Future research that builds on the findings of the present study is needed to investigate if the inclusion of adolescents’ feedback into the adaptation of prevention curricula can strengthen program impact, either by making adaptations to the curricula itself to better fit the audience, by fostering their engagement and buy-in into the process of implementation, or both.
18472992:0	Introduction 
The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in children varies from 5% to 80%.
18472992:1	The etiology is complex and multifaceted, including patient-related factors, type of surgical procedure, choice of anesthetic agents, and postoperative management.
18472992:2	Children undergoing strabismus surgery are particularly prone to PONV.
18472992:3	Postoperative vomiting (emesis) is the forceful expulsion of gastrointestinal contents through the mouth and is mediated by a variety of neurotransmitters including serotonin which binds to serotonergic (5-HT 3) receptors located both peripherally on the vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema.
18472992:4	The serotonin receptor antagonists (including ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron, and tropisetron), purportedly block the effects of serotonin in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, nucleus tractus solitarius, and vagal afferents.
18472992:5	These antiemetic agents have been shown to reduce chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, as well as PONV.
18472992:6	Intravenous (IV) ondansetron administered in doses ranging from 40–200 mcg/kg has been extensively studied for prevention of PONV in children undergoing strabismus surgery.
18472992:7	An innovative freeze-dried ondansetron oral disintegrating tablet (ODT) was developed to allow for disintegration on the tongue with dissolution and rapid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of water (see ).
18472992:8	The active ingredient in ODT is the racemic form of ondansetron, and a 4-mg ODT contains 4 mg of ondansetron base.
18472992:9	have demonstrated equivalency of ODT 8 mg to oral ondansetron 8 mg in highly emetogencic chemotherapy.
18472992:10	The pharmacokinetic data suggests that ondansetron is readily and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration.
18472992:11	In children undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy, ODT (4–8 mg) showed similar efficacy for complete control of emesis compared with IV ondansetron; 93% versus 92% respectively, and was considered safe, well tolerated and cost effective.
18472992:12	In children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, a fixed dose of 4 mg ODT resulted in the number needed to treat (NNT) = 2.86 with a relative risk reduction for PONV of 50%.
18472992:13	Additionally, the ODT was found to be acceptable in taste with 87% of patients willing to take the medication in the future.
18472992:14	The properties of ODT make it a potentially useful agent in children who cannot swallow water or pills during the perioperative period.
18472992:15	The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the efficacy of ODT in reducing the incidence and severity of POV in children undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery.
18472992:16	Methods 
Approval from the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB) and written informed consent from a parent or legal guardian was obtained for this prospective, observational, historically controlled study.
18472992:17	Healthy children aged 4–12 years of age, ASA I-II, scheduled to undergo strabismus surgery were recruited.
18472992:18	Those with a history of cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurological impairment, prior severe PONV, known sensitivity to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, and requirement for premedication were excluded.
18472992:19	Preoperatively, each child received an oral dose of acetaminophen (15 mg·kg −1) followed by a 4 mg ODT 30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia.
18472992:20	Acceptability of the ODT was scored using a 4 point scale (1 = readily, 2 = reluctant, 3 = held down, 4 = refused).
18472992:21	General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via facemask.
18472992:22	A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane.
18472992:23	Ketorolac (0.5 mg· kg −1) was administered following placement of the IV intraoperatively.
18472992:24	At the completion of the surgery, the stomach was aspirated via an oral-gastric tube and the LMA was removed at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.
18472992:25	Strict adherence to the protocol were maintained by research personnel who were present the entire time of the surgical procedure.
18472992:26	Postoperatively, children were observed for any episode of POV or retching.
18472992:27	Two or more episodes of vomiting or retching were treated with metoclopramide 0.15 mg·kg −1 IV as a rescue medication.
18472992:28	Pain was assessed using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) observational pain scale and children with scores ≥4 were treated with morphine sulfate 0.05 mg·kg −1 IV titrated per routine practice.
18472992:29	Parents were telephoned the day after surgery to assess further POV, treatment and potential adverse effects.
18472992:30	Additionally, parents rated their satisfaction with the prevention and treatment of POV as 1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = satisfied, 4 = very satisfied.
18472992:31	Historical placebo controls from previous studies of POV conducted at the same institution using the same identical anesthetic technique and research protocol were used for statistical comparison ( ; ).
18472992:32	These studies were placebo controlled studies of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery.
18472992:33	Patients were randomized to IV dolasetron in a fixed dose and weight based dose versus IV sodium chloride or oral granisetron compounded in strawberry syrup versus strawberry syrup alone each in equivalent volumes.
18472992:34	For the purposes of analyses, the severity of POV was classified as mild (1 episode), moderate (2 episodes), or severe (3 or more episodes).
18472992:35	Additionally, the primary efficacy measure was an acute complete response (ACR) which was defined as no emetic episodes or rescue antiemetic medication use within 24 hours of ODT 4 mg administration.
18472992:36	Categorical data such as ACR, and the incidence and severity of PONV were compared using chi-square with Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate.
18472992:37	Patient age, weight, and other parametric data were compared using unpaired t-tests.
18472992:38	Data are reported as mean + SD or n (%) with p values of <0.05 considered statistically significant.
18472992:39	Results 
A total of 49 children were enrolled in the study.
18472992:40	Fourteen children were excluded due to protocol violations such as administration of morphine intraoperatively or use of additional prophylactic antiemetics.
18472992:41	Data from 35 children who received ODT are, therefore, reported.
18472992:42	The historical control group included 31 children who received placebo in 2 studies as described previously ( ; ).
18472992:43	The demographics and perioperative data were similar between the placebo and ODT groups, with the exception that children in the ODT group had a significantly longer anesthetic duration compared with controls.
18472992:44	Outcome data including the incidence and severity of POV, use of rescue medications, and ACR are presented in .
18472992:45	One hundred percent of the patients readily accepted the ODT and no children were admitted to the hospital as a result of POV.
18472992:46	Nausea was only assessed in children able to verbalize and understand the concept of nausea by a yes/no response.
18472992:47	The incidence headache, abdominal pain, emergence agitation and other side effects were similar between groups.
18472992:48	The respective incidences for the ODT compared with placebo were 72.7% versus 67.7% for headache, 96.9% versus 93.5% for abdominal pain, and 2.9% versus 0.0% for emergence delirium 
Discussion 
Postoperative nausea and vomiting remain a leading cause of morbidity in pediatric surgical patients, contributing to bleeding, dehydration, wound dehiscence and the potential for pulmonary aspiration.
18472992:49	Additionally, severe PONV occurs with a frequency of 1%–3% and may result in unanticipated hospital admission leading to increased institutional costs.
18472992:50	A recent multi-center study involving 1257 children aged birth-14 yrs old showed that strabismus surgery was an independent risk factor for postoperative vomiting.
18472992:51	Of all risk factors it was the most significant with an OR of 5.2 similar to other reported incidences of up to 87%.
18472992:52	Findings from this study demonstrate that prophylactic administration of ODT in a fixed dose of 4 mg reduced the incidence and severity of PONV in young children undergoing strabismus surgery.
18472992:53	Additionally, recent studies suggest that ODT is similarly useful for the prevention of PONV in children.
18472992:54	compared 4 mg ODT versus placebo in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.
18472992:55	Although patients also received intraoperative dexamethasone, the ODT group experienced significantly less vomiting and the ODT was readily accepted.
18472992:56	In adult patients evaluated the ODT in patients undergoing outpatient gynecological laparoscopy with general anesthesia.
18472992:57	Patients received 4 mg of IV ondansetron at induction and either 8 mg ODT or placebo prior to discharge.
18472992:58	The ODT group experienced less severe nausea and fewer episodes of vomiting after discharge from PACU compared with the placebo group.
18472992:59	A study in craniotomy surgery patients also evaluated the postoperative administration of the ODT in an 8 mg dose compared with placebo as rescue therapy for PONV.
18472992:60	Patients who received the ODT required less rescue therapy with metoclopramide than did the placebo group.
18472992:61	It appears that the ODT formulation may be efficacious for both the prevention and treatment of PONV in adults and possibly children.
18472992:62	The antiemetic efficacy of ODT has also been demonstrated previously for both radio-therapy, and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( ; ).
18472992:63	A study in patients receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy compared 8 mg of oral ondansetron (OT) to 8 mg of ODT given twice daily for 3 days.
18472992:64	The ODT was found to be equivalent to the OT for control of emesis with 89% of patients finding the taste acceptable.
18472992:65	Although there remains an ongoing debate over the appropriate timing of administration of the 5-HT 3 antagonists, a recent study by found no difference in efficacy between groups of children who received 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron IV at induction versus the end of strabismus surgery.
18472992:66	It appears that in pediatric strabismus surgery, the time of administration of ondansetron is not related to efficacy.
18472992:67	Data suggest that ondansetron is completely and readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration.
18472992:68	The time to reach peak concentration is between 0.5 to 2 hours with an approximate 160 liter volume of distribution and 70 to 76% plasma protein binding.
18472992:69	The elimination half-life averages approximately 3.8 ± 1 hour and is extensively metabolized primarily through hydroxylation with subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation.
18472992:70	Many factors contribute to POV that were not controlled for such as the use of reversal agents, hydration status, etc.
18472992:71	Ideally, alternative methods of anesthesia and analgesia could potentially lower the emetogenic potential in this population or the addition of other antiemetics such as dexamethasone in combination with the ODT.
18472992:72	Ondansetron and dolasetron demonstrated comparative efficacy when used in combination with dexamethasone for POV prophylaxis in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgery.
18472992:73	Studies have also shown that the combination of metoclopramide with ondansetron was no more effective than ondansetron alone in children undergoing strabismus surgery.
18472992:74	Hence the addition of metoclopramide in a prophylaxis regimen for PONV is probably not warranted.
18472992:75	The ODT offers a unique, cost effective, formulation of a 5HT3 agent that is readily acceptable and safe in the pediatric surgical population.
18472992:76	Additionally, while PONV is unpleasant for the child, it can also be disturbing to the parents and actually increase their time spent nursing the child in PACU.
18472992:77	Limitations 
One important limitation of this study is the use of historical controls.
18472992:78	It was felt that the use of a placebo control – in the case of children undergoing a known highly emetogenic surgery – was unethical given the known risks.
18472992:79	Additionally data obtained from previous studies within the same institution provided a fairly equal distribution of matched controls that could be used for comparison.
18472992:80	Although faculty and staff performing the surgeries had changed, the use of research personnel to ensure compliance with the identical protocols was critical.
18472992:81	Conclusion 
The ODT is a readily acceptable form of a 5HT 3 antagonist that can be safely used in children undergoing strabismus surgery for the prevention of POV.
18472992:82	Additional studies are warranted to evaluate its utility in other types of pediatric surgeries with high incidences of POV and also its effectiveness as a rescue agent in the PACU.
17059596:0	Background 
Eukaryote genomes contain repetitive DNA sequences that can be classified into two groups: tandemly repeated sequences (e.g., micro- and minisatellites) and dispersed sequences (e.g., long interspersed elements – LINEs – and short interspersed elements – SINEs).
17059596:1	Microsatellites (MSs) are tandem repeats of a DNA motif, one to six bases long, showing high levels of polymorphism based on changes in the repeat number.
17059596:2	They are highly abundant and considered selectively neutral sequences and almost randomly distributed in the mammalian genome . In spite of the wide applications of MSs and their importance in genetic and evolutionary studies, the mechanisms of the genesis of these sequences are still not fully understood.
17059596:3	It is thought that point mutation is the dominant source of generation of short repeat MSs before slippage becomes the dominant mechanism [ - ].
17059596:4	However, based on the close association described between retroposons and MSs in several mammalian species (in sheep ; in pig ; in primates ; in humans ; in horse ), a completely different mechanism for MS generation has been proposed: it is thought that retrotranscripts undergo 3' polyadenylation – similar to mRNA polyadenylation  – prior to their incorporation into the genome, and that the extension of this preexisting repeat can generate A-rich MSs . Nevertheless, this mechanism would not explain the recent observations (in barley, ; in Dipterans, ) that MSs can also be associated with both 5' and internal regions of some retroposons.
17059596:5	An explanation for the latter association is the mechanism described by Wilder and Hollocher  which implies the conversion of an existing sequence with high cryptic simplicity located in Dipteran mini-me elements into tandemly repeated DNA.
17059596:6	The importance of repeat elements as MS sources is still unclear.
17059596:7	Whereas Nadir et al.  proposed Alu elements as the preferential source for the origin of human MSs, Morgante et al.  showed a significant association between MSs and the single/low-copy fraction of the plant genome.
17059596:8	In mammals, most retroposons can be classified into three basic types: SINEs, LINEs, and LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) elements, with SINEs being the most abundant.
17059596:9	SINEs are 80–400 bp long genomic repeats, apparently originating from tRNA (with the exception of human Alu and rodent B1 families which are derived from 7SL cytoplasmatic RNA, ).
17059596:10	A typical SINE is flanked by short direct repeats and consists of three regions: a tRNA-related region, which contains an internal promoter for RNA polymerase III; a central family-specific or tRNA-unrelated region; and an A-rich tail (fig.
17059596:11	; for a review of SINEs, see ).
17059596:12	In carnivores, the tRNA-derived SINEs (tRNA SINEs), also known as CAN-SINEs, are thought to derive from tRNA Lys . They are also characterized by a polypyrimidine region (poly-Y) in their central region, and a polyadenylation AATAAA signal and the RNA polymerase III TTTT or TCTT terminator in the A-rich tail . The tRNA-related region is more conserved than the unrelated part and the RNA polymerase III promoter is the most conserved, while poly-Y and A-rich tail are highly variable both in sequence and in length . At first, it was thought that tRNA SINE distribution was limited to doglike carnivores (Canoidea superfamily; e.g.: dogs, bears, raccoons, weasels, skunks, and seals).
17059596:13	However, recent works  have detected the tRNA SINE in the genome of several species of catlike carnivores (Feloidea superfamily; e.g.: hyenas, cats, mongooses, and civets) but not beyond carnivores.
17059596:14	In this study we constructed a comprehensive database of carnivore MS clones from GenBank to explore the role of interspersed repeats in the generation of repeat arrays.
17059596:15	We focused on tRNA SINEs which constitute the best characterized and most abundant interspersed repeat element in the carnivore genome.
17059596:16	We observed two modes of MS genesis in two regions of tRNA SINEs in which MSs have repeatedly evolved.
17059596:17	This observation led us to hypothesize that SINEs generating MSs could explain part of the different repeat array content and distribution among and within genomes.
17059596:18	We also demonstrated that MSs associated with tRNA SINEs were more complex and had less potential instability than those not associated.
17059596:19	The observations reported here therefore have practical implications since the use of MSs related with tRNA SINEs calls for special attention from the designing of experiments to the interpretation of results.
17059596:20	Results 
Discussion 
Our database was generated from MS-containing clones of carnivore species which are generally used in population genetics and individual identification studies.
17059596:21	These MSs had been isolated following the traditional method, which is known to produce a nonrepresentative sample of the genome.
17059596:22	Two common procedures repeatedly used in traditional MS isolation that may cause biases in our database are: i) the use of Sau 3AI restriction enzyme to fragment genomic DNA, and ii) the use of AC probes to screen the libraries.
17059596:23	However, and despite the biases inherent in isolation methods, the drawn conclusions are still pertinent or in some cases even reinforced (see below).
17059596:24	Sau 3AI recognizes sites that are well-conserved in dispersed repeats (e.g., in porcine PRE-1, in rat L1 elements), and in the B-box of the tRNA polymerase III promoter of our tRNA SINEs.
17059596:25	As a result, the SINEs found in our databases were often truncated (87.0%), conserving the 5' end in 127 cases and the 3' end, including the poly-Y and A-rich tail regions, in 188 cases.
17059596:26	We found 47 full tRNA SINEs which could be used as phylogenetic markers.
17059596:27	This fact has led some authors (e.g. ) to state that the use of Sau 3AI may result in bias towards the isolation of repeat-associated MSs.
17059596:28	However, such a bias could not exist taking into account the high frequency of cutting owing to the restriction recognition site for Sau 3AI (^GATC) is only four nucleotides in length.
17059596:29	The preferential use of (AC) n probes for library screening was reflected in the repeat motif content of our database where 58% were AC repeats, clearly overrepresented .
17059596:30	However, in this work we have demonstrated that AC repeats are not statistically associated with tRNA-SINEs – only 5.3% of the AC repeats in the whole database were located within the SINE sequence.
17059596:31	Similar results have been found in humans where more than 80% of AC repeats are not associated with Alu sequences [ , ].
17059596:32	Using AC probes would therefore reduce the final number of SINEs captured in the MS isolation process.
17059596:33	Our tRNA SINE copy estimates per haploid genome in dog (9.1*10 5) were very similar to the values obtained from the dog genome sequence (1.06*10 6 ).
17059596:34	It seems then reasonable to think that the values we obtained for the other carnivore species (2.1*10 6 tRNA SINEs in cat, 2.3*10 6 in badger, 2.0*10 6 in giant panda, and 4.5*10 6 in spotted hyena) may also be realistic approximations.
17059596:35	Even in the case where the above mentioned biases do apply – probably reducing tRNA SINE captured -, it is unlikely they would produce a difference of an order of magnitude with published estimates (10 5 – 3*10 5 in mustelids, 2*10 5 in cats and true seals, and 1.5*10 5 – 4*10 5 in dogs and bears [ , ]).
17059596:36	We also observed that poly-Y (65.0%) and A-rich tail (53.2%) regularly gave rise to MSs.
17059596:37	The different repeat motifs derived from these regions (mostly AG and AAAT, respectively) suggested two mechanisms for MS generation.
17059596:38	The first mechanism was illustrated by the A-rich tail and it has already been well described in human Alu sequences .
17059596:39	This mode of genesis implies the presence of a pre-existing MS and subsequent modifications by point mutation and slippage events.
17059596:40	It has been suggested that the pre-existing MS could arise from the incorporation of the retrotranscript with an extended polyadenylated tail, a feature which may also serve to guide their retroposition in the genome .
17059596:41	Although the pre-existing MS was an adenine tract, this evolved into more complex structures where we observe certain variability in the repeat motif, mostly centered in A rich MS (A 12.6% and A 2–4N 57.8%).
17059596:42	The second mechanism is based on the fact that the poly-Y region has a nucleotide composition highly biased towards pyrimidines.
17059596:43	It could therefore be defined as a site with high cryptic simplicity , which is a DNA sequence biased in nucleotide composition and made up of short sequence motifs that, initially, are not tandemly repeated.
17059596:44	The functional significance of this structure currently remains unknown, but its presence in these elements makes the SINE an important source of MS genesis.
17059596:45	Generation of MSs at this site depends on base substitutions that create a tandemly duplicated motif, and on subsequent slippage mutations to increase the number of copies.
17059596:46	Thus, a few C ↔ T transitions, the most frequent substitutions, are enough to transform cryptic simplicity sequences into tandemly repeated DNA.
17059596:47	The initial bias in the base substitution was reflected in the repeat motifs generated, 73.4% of which were AGs.
17059596:48	This tendency for invariability and the greater number of MSs produced by the poly-Y region suggest that slippage mutation is active during the early stages of MS genesis.
17059596:49	This MS-generating mutation process has also been shown in an internal region of the mini-me elements of Dipterans . The poly-Y region has also been found to be specific of other mammalian SINEs, such as rabbit C repeat , rodent DIP , bat VES , and insectivore TAL, ERI-1 and ERI-2 , showing that the action of the two mechanisms that generate MSs are not exclusive to the tRNA SINEs.
17059596:50	It is known that different MS motifs, motif classes and even abundances are not equally represented in species belonging to different groups  or even within the genome of any one particular species .
17059596:51	These differences are still not well-understood and it has been hypothesized that they may be caused by species-specific differences in the DNA synthesis and repair machinery , selection , or base composition .
17059596:52	Although tRNA SINEs are not the only source of MSs in carnivore genomes, these elements could explain part of the differences in the distribution of MSs within a particular genome due to their high abundance and their preference for insertion at specific sites – such as around the R bands  and clustering or insertion into other mobile genetic elements [ , ].
17059596:53	They could also explain differences among phylogenetically distant species or groups, since the interspersed repeat families generating MSs may be lineage specific.
17059596:54	Along these lines, our results would indicate that tRNA SINEs have a significant effect on the overall distribution of some repeat motifs in carnivores, especially AG and AAAT repeats.
17059596:55	The strong association between repeat elements and MSs has been largely used for different purposes, such as: i) to develop new, codominant multiplex marker technologies such as S-SAP  or inter-AluPCR ; ii) to build MS-enriched libraries by amplifying Sau 3AI inserts with a conserved SINE primer and a flanking vector primer ; iii) to discover new SINEs, especially in species for which little information is available concerning their repeat element content ; and iv) to discover new SINE loci which could be used to reconstruct phylogenies . In this study we detected 47 completed SINEs whose flanking regions are targets for primer design and could be used as phylogenetic markers.
17059596:56	In spite of these applications, MSs associated with interspersed repeats not only distort estimates of the genomic distribution of MSs useful for genome mapping , but also entail some methodological disadvantages.
17059596:57	Firstly, genotyping with MSs associated with repeat elements is very hard.
17059596:58	Placing one of the PCR primers within a highly repeated element might cause weak amplification, high background and difficulty in locus-specific amplification [ , ].
17059596:59	Moreover, if the primers were designed up- and downstream from the repeated element, the expected large size of the PCR product might cause problems in the resolution of the amplified products . Our results also showed that potential instability in MSs associated with tRNA SINEs was lower than in non-associated MSs.
17059596:60	Several studies (e.g. [ - ]) have shown that MS mutation rate increases with an increasing number of repeat units; this is considered the single most important factor affecting the mutation rate.
17059596:61	The isolation of non-masked MS clones is therefore advisable on account of their high potential informative content.
17059596:62	It has been argued that point mutations break up perfect repeats and reduce the mutation rates of MSs .
17059596:63	Since there are not significant differences in the number of imperfect repeat arrays among databases, the higher content of short repeat arrays in MSs associated with tRNA SINE cannot entirely be attributed to imperfections.
17059596:64	Finally, most of the applications involving MSs as genetic markers are based on variations in the length of the PCR product, which is expected to vary according to single-step changes in the number of repeats.
17059596:65	However, it has been shown that poly-Y is responsible for variation in length in the MS flanking region within species (López-Giráldez et al., unpublished data).
17059596:66	This is probably due to the fact that cryptically simple sequences are susceptible to undergo slippage in a similar manner to MSs, but at lower rates . We also detected a larger number of clones with multiple MSs in the tRNA SINE database owing to the presence of poly-Y and A-rich tail.
17059596:67	This may also explain the non-neutral observation of MS clustering . Both cases mentioned preclude the basic assumptions of MS mutational models.
17059596:68	As a result, the interpretation of the data obtained from MSs associated with tRNA SINEs may induce erroneous conclusions.
17059596:69	Thus, we propose avoiding the use of MS associated with interspersed repeats as genetic markers.
17059596:70	Conclusion 
In this report we have shown how tRNA SINEs, the most abundant carnivore and a lineage-specific SINE, are clearly responsible for generating an important fraction of carnivore MSs.
17059596:71	More specifically, we have demonstrated that not only the A-rich tails but also an internal region (poly-Y) of these elements regularly expand into lengthy MSs via two different mechanisms: the expansion of pre-existing tandem repeats and the conversion of sequences with high cryptic simplicity into tandemly repetitive DNA.
17059596:72	The MS genesis in tRNA-SINEs is not only involved in complex patterns, such as multiple repeated arrays and length variation in the flanking regions, and is responsible for shorter repeat arrays, but may also explain differences in MS distribution among and within species genomes.
17059596:73	The mechanism we have described in tRNA SINEs may also be generalized to other interspersed repeats.
17059596:74	Based on the negative effect of the association between MSs and interspersed repeats, we recommend avoiding the use of these MSs as genetic markers.
17059596:75	We suggest applying computer tools after initial sequencing in order to detect interspersed repeats in MS-containing clones and taking special attention when designing isolation methods (e.g., not using Sau 3AI and AG or AAAT probes).

16982644:0	INTRODUCTION 
Microarray is a powerful technology for detecting and resolving a large number of nucleic acids simultaneously.
16982644:1	cDNA microarrays ( – ) for large-scale analysis of gene expression and DNA copy number changes have been used extensively.
16982644:2	Computer programs for all steps involved in analyzing cDNA array data have been developed.
16982644:3	Microarrays used for genotyping are receiving more and more attention, especially after the discovery of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
16982644:4	To meet the strong demand in high-throughput SNP genotyping, we and several other groups ( – ) have developed high-throughput multiplex genotyping systems, which have been used in many studies ( – ).
16982644:5	With these systems, a large number of SNP-containing sequences can be amplified in one or a few tubes followed by the analysis with oligonucleotide microarrays; and thousands of SNPs in a large number of samples can be genotyped in a highly efficient and affordable way.
16982644:6	However, the immense amount of data generated from even a single microarray precludes manual processing.
16982644:7	Automation of data analysis is an essential prerequisite for routine genotyping with microarrays.
16982644:8	Experimentally, data from oligonucleotide microarrays are obtained by hybridizing sample sequences to corresponding probes arrayed on solid supports.
16982644:9	Detection of specific sequences is accomplished by either labeling the sample sequences with fluorescent dyes before hybridization or labeling the probes after hybridization.
16982644:10	The fluorescent intensities on the probes are determined by digitizing the images of arrayed spots after scanning.
16982644:11	When data are obtained in good quality, the accuracy of genotyping results is usually affected by two factors, background signal and color channel bias.
16982644:12	Normally, signalfrom each array spot consists of signal from specific labeling that is predominant and non-specific signal as a small portion.
16982644:13	The amount of non-specific signal may vary depending on experimental performance.
16982644:14	To ensure a high degree of genotyping accuracy, it is necessary to separate the non-specific noise from the specific signal.
16982644:15	When more than one fluorescent dye is used to label sequences of different natures, the signal intensities from different dyes could differ even if the same amounts of sequences are present in the sample.
16982644:16	Variation may be caused by the differences in fluorescent emission and scanning efficiency of the dyes.
16982644:17	When an array is scanned, the ‘gains’ used for different fluorescent channels may vary, depending on the users' experience and the scanner performance.
16982644:18	These factors may result in a global difference between signal intensities of the fluorescent dyes.
16982644:19	Therefore, the microarray data from different color channels need to be normalized so that the intensities of different colors can be compared.
16982644:20	In the case of SNPs, the two allelic sequences of a heterozygous SNP may not necessarily incorporate equal amounts of fluorescence.
16982644:21	Therefore, a highly accurate normalization method is required to separate such a bias from the difference caused by the amounts of DNA.
16982644:22	Several methods for channel normalization and background estimation have been reported.
16982644:23	One of the commonly used methods for the normalization of RNA expression data is to correct the systematic bias by using the channel signal means of all spots assuming that the average gene expression levels in the genome have little changes ( – ).
16982644:24	However, in an SNP analysis, the number of allelic molecules labeled in one color may not be equal to those in the other color.
16982644:25	In this case, the channel signal means would be biased.
16982644:26	Intensity-dependent normalization methods have also been used, such as Lowess smoothing method.
16982644:27	When the logarithms of intensity ratios [Ln( R )] are plotted against the logarithms of intensity products [Ln( I )], the Lowess method detects the systematic bias in the plot by carrying out a local weighted linear regression.
16982644:28	The bias is corrected when the Ln( R ) value of each spot is subtracted by its fitted value.
16982644:29	This method is not ideal for analyzing SNP genotyping data either, because the amounts of signals from unequal amounts of allelic sequences present in the sample may also contribute to the local bias in an Ln( R ) versus Ln( I ) plot, which could be incorrectly removed by local bias subtraction.
16982644:30	Methods for background estimation have also been reported previously.
16982644:31	One method for background signal estimation uses the fluorescence signal within the surrounding area of a spot as a representation of its background.
16982644:32	This method only takes inter-spot background into consideration, while intra-spot background is the real non-specific signal contributing to the spot signal intensities.
16982644:33	Another method involves using microarray spots containing only the printing buffer as controls.
16982644:34	Obviously, signals from these controls may not reflect non-specific hybridization.
16982644:35	Although printing buffer with non-probe oligonucleotides can be used as controls, these controls are always limited by the number of spots allowable on the array and may also not be representative of non-specific signal from real probes.
16982644:36	Affymetrix genotyping microarrays use probes containing one or two mismatches as controls for each SNP.
16982644:37	Hardenbol et al . used four probes for each biallelic SNP among which the two non-allelic probes served as background controls.
16982644:38	Di et al . developed dynamic model-based algorithms for genotyping.
16982644:39	The authors calculated the likelihood of the possible allelic states using signals from 56 perfect match and mismatch probes for each SNP.
16982644:40	Mismatch probes in this method provide marker-specific assessment of background.
16982644:41	However, these probes can only be used to determine the ratio between perfect match and mismatch probes, and not to define the background signal since in a microarray analysis, usually the mismatches between the non-specific sequences and the probes are more than one or two bases.
16982644:42	In addition, the cost for extra probes is another concern.
16982644:43	We have developed new algorithms for microarray-based SNP analysis.
16982644:44	Our algorithms take advantage of the large number of SNPs analyzed in each high-throughput assay and use signal intensities of SNPs that are very likely to be homozygous as both negative and positive controls.
16982644:45	Therefore, these controls reflect the scenario in real samples.
16982644:46	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
The above data preprocessing steps improve the data quality in three aspects:
 
Spots falling between different genotype clusters on the scatter plots are one of the major error sources.
16982644:47	AccuTyping has a ‘twilight zone’ function.
16982644:48	The twilight zones are centered by the cutoff lines.
16982644:49	Users may adjust the width of the twilight zones based on the data quality to further insure the genotyping accuracy.
16982644:50	A computer software, AccuTyping, was developed based on the algorithms described above.
16982644:51	AccuTyping takes inputs of the two color intensities digitized from scanned microarray images with one of the two popular software packages, GenePix (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA) or ImaGene (Biodiscovery, Inc.,
16982644:52	El Segundo, CA).
16982644:53	The program may process either single datasets separately or multiple datasets in a batch.
16982644:54	shows the Windows interface of the program.
16982644:55	When the probes are spotted in duplicate on the array, the average signal intensities are used.
16982644:56	Occasionally, the average may not necessarily be an appropriate estimate of true signal values.
16982644:57	For example, the average of two duplicated spots with predominant signals in opposite colors could give a heterozygous call.
16982644:58	The program detects such cases and excludes them in the final genotyping step.
16982644:59	Some spots could show apparent abnormality in the microarray images because of mechanical failure during experiment.
16982644:60	AccuTyping excludes these spots if the user flags them.
16982644:61	After channel normalization, low-signal filtering and background subtraction, genotype calls are made.
16982644:62	The program also checks reproducibility between repeated assays and the accuracy by comparing the genotype calls from independent genotyping methods.
16982644:63	AccuTyping outputs comma separated value (CSV) files containing genotype calls, the original and processed data as well as the numerical values for the parameters used for normalization, background subtraction and low-signal filtering.
16982644:64	The statistics of detection, concordance and accuracy, if available, are also appended in the output files.
16982644:65	For a batch run, output results are written into a separate file for each dataset.
16982644:66	All genotypes are pooled into an additional file to facilitate further analysis.
16982644:67	The program is available for download from our website . 
AccuTyping has been used routinely for SNP genotyping with human genomic DNA and single-sperm samples in our laboratory.
16982644:68	shows part of the genotyping results from typing 1172 SNPs in 24 human genomic DNA samples.
16982644:69	The program indicates a detection rate of 98.54% with probes that incorporate fluorescently labeled nucleotides ddA or ddG (AG probes) and 98.85% with probes in the other direction, which incorporate fluorescently labeled ddC and ddT (CT probes).
16982644:70	An average detection rate with dual probes was 97.58%, which is 1.5 and 1.8% different from the rates for single probes, respectively.
16982644:71	Since genotyping with probes in two different directions is carried out in independent experiments, results generated in this way can validate each other.
16982644:72	After comparing the genotyping results obtained with probes in different directions, a small portion of the genotypes may be found to be inconsistent.
16982644:73	As shown in the average non-concordant rate is 2.94% with an SD of 0.36%.
16982644:74	However, being non-concordant does not mean incorrect.
16982644:75	Since the system involves only two colors, it is reasonable to assume that if only the probes in one direction were used, half of the non-concordant genotypes should be correct.
16982644:76	This hypothesis was verified in our recent publication.
16982644:77	Based on this method, accuracy based on the dual-probe approach is calculated and listed in .
16982644:78	It should be pointed out that the non-concordant rates calculated in this way are used to estimate the error rates for the results obtained with single probes.
16982644:79	Practically, non-concordant genotypes detected with dual probes will be discarded.
16982644:80	In this case, the error rate among the concordant genotypes should be ɛ 2, where ɛ is the error rate for single probes, and the issue would be how accurate the remaining genotype calls would be.
16982644:81	Usually, results generated with probes in two directions can be used to address this issue.
16982644:82	To take extra precaution, a panel of 1282 such genotypes was retyped with the RFLPs and direct sequencing methods, and all were shown to be consistent with the microarray results.
16982644:83	These results indicate the accuracy of the dual-probe method is close or even equal to 100%.
16982644:84	DISCUSSION 
Practically, all microarray data need to be normalized before information extraction.
16982644:85	However, normalizations for data from SNP genotyping arrays and for those from gene expression profiling arrays are different concepts.
16982644:86	Gene expression profiling arrays are used to learn the quantitative features of gene products in different samples.
16982644:87	Normalization for these arrays should include (i) intra-array normalization to make intensities of different color channels comparable and (ii) inter-array normalization so that the quantities of gene products detected from different arrays can be compared.
16982644:88	In contrast, SNP genotyping arrays are used to discriminate the allelic sequences differing by single bases.
16982644:89	As long as these sequences can be accurately and reliably distinguished, inter-array differences may not be necessarily a major concern.
16982644:90	By using a large number of reliably predicted homozygous SNPs as controls, we have developed very straightforward algorithms for analyzing microarray-based genotyping data.
16982644:91	In conjunction with the dual-probe assay, our approach has achieved very high accuracy and reliability.
16982644:92	Algorithms have been developed to analyze genotyping data generated by the Affymetrix SNP microarrays with very high degree of accuracy.
16982644:93	Unfortunately, these algorithms were specifically developed for the Affymetrix system that use perfect match and mismatch probes.
16982644:94	Such a requirement limits the application of these algorithms in three aspects: (i) most non-Affymetrix arrays do not use the mismatch probes; (ii) Affymetrix arrays contain only a small portion of known SNPs; and (iii) most genetic studies use customized specific SNP sets depending on the chromosomal regions or genes under study and many studies may not need as many SNP as those on the Affymetrix arrays.
16982644:95	Therefore, algorithms that can be used universally for different platforms and for various SNP panels including the industrially established panels are highly desirable.
16982644:96	Our algorithms require homozygous SNPs as controls which are abundant in any large-scale microarray analysis, and are simple and straightforward.
16982644:97	Therefore, it can be used for this purpose.
16982644:98	A clustering-based algorithm for analyzing SNP genotyping data was reported by Rabbee and Speed very recently.
16982644:99	The algorithm was implemented by training the computer program with publicly available SNP genotyping data.
16982644:100	Although the training datasets were exclusively generated by the Affymetrix SNP arrays, the algorithm may be used to analyze data generated by non-Affymetrix arrays since it does not depend on the mismatched probes.
16982644:101	However, as pointed out by the authors, it is difficult to train the program for SNPs with alleles at a low frequency because the clustering method itself requires a certain number of samples to reach sufficient statistic confidence.
16982644:102	When an SNP allele is at a very low frequency, the sample size required for this purpose could be very large.
16982644:103	The same issue is true for all SNPs that do not have sufficient data available.
16982644:104	Furthermore, when a new genotyping method is to be established, there would be not genotyping data available for training the program.
16982644:105	With our system, the non-concordant genotypes can be discarded to ensure a high degree of accuracy.
16982644:106	However, an interesting issue would be how these errors are generated.
16982644:107	Based on the dual-probe analysis, the non-concordant genotypes were found not to be randomly distributed among the samples.
16982644:108	A small fraction (∼6%) of SNPs were found to be associated with either non-concordant or undetectable signals among >30% of the samples.
16982644:109	More detailed analyses including single-sperm analysis revealed that the majority of these SNPs were either not real SNPs (showing as heterozygous in most single-sperm samples) which could be caused by repetitive sequences or were affected by other unknown genetic variations located in the primer or probe regions.
16982644:110	After eliminating these SNPs from further analysis, the concordant rate for the data in would be increased from 97.06 to 98.65% with an accuracy of 99.9954%, indicating that not only is our experimental approach robust but also that our computer algorithms are highly reliable.
16982644:111	Other than being an appropriate method for channel normalization and background subtraction, using homozygous SNPs as controls has another advantage i.e. their large numbers.
16982644:112	Thousands of SNPs can be analyzed by a single array, and the homozygous SNPs are in abundance.
16982644:113	This method enhances reliability and is much more comprehensive in reflecting various factors that may contribute to data variability on the overall array as compared to using very few controls.
16982644:114	The cost and effort of adding extra control oligonucleotides is also eliminated.
16982644:115	Owing to the ever-increasing capability of a small or medium sized laboratory to generate a large volume of microarray data routinely, it is expected that AccuTyping will benefit many microarray users.
15208715:0	Introduction 
About half of the expected mitochondrial proteins in humans are known to date, and already a fifth of these known proteins are associated with human Mendelian disorders (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ; ; ).
15208715:1	Mitochondrial core functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly have been highly conserved during evolution, suggesting that a systematic identification of mitochondrial proteins in model organisms will accelerate the search for new human mitochondrial disease genes.
15208715:2	In yeast, 477 proteins (469 encoded by the nuclear genome) show conclusive evidence of mitochondrial localization (this study and those listed in the Mitochondrial Proteome 2 [MitoP2] database ).
15208715:3	About 30% of these proteins have evidence of orthologs in humans (MitoP2 database).
15208715:4	Identification of the yeast mitochondrial proteome is far from complete.
15208715:5	Thirty to forty percent of the predicted complement of proteins that make up the organelle are still considered unknown although many genome-wide and functional systematic studies have been applied.
15208715:6	These include systematic identification of mitochondrial proteins by mRNA expression analysis under various conditions ( ; ), DNA microarray analysis of mRNA populations associated with mitochondrion-bound polysomes, deletion phenotype screening ( ; ), large-scale localization studies, protein–protein interaction studies ( ; ; ; ), mass spectrometry (MS) of mitochondria ( ; ), and various computational predictions of mitochondrial proteins ( ; ; ).
15208715:7	In addition, two recent studies reduced the gap of missing mitochondrial localized proteins: a comprehensive proteomic study of mitochondria claimed to reduce the gap to 10% and identified 749 proteins, and a protein localization study identified 527 mitochondrial localized proteins by green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging.
15208715:8	Here we generated a component list of the mitochondrial organelle by first identifying mitochondrial proteins using MS and then integrating 22 datasets relevant to the study of mitochondria, including our proteomic data.
15208715:9	The integration generated a comprehensive definition of the proteins involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis and allowed for a comparison of genomic approaches, with implications beyond mitochondria.
20967231:0	Introduction 
Organisms exhibit daily (circadian) rhythms in behavior and physiology that are attuned to the earth's rotational period.
20967231:1	The periods of these intrinsic rhythms are approximately 24 h and are synchronized by external cues or zeitgebers (time givers) such as light and temperature.
20967231:2	The molecular composition and regulation of endogenous pacemakers that generate circadian rhythms have been extensively investigated.
20967231:3	Both the molecules composing the core clock and the molecular mechanisms of clock function are remarkably divergent across kingdoms, as well as between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, suggesting multiple, independent evolutionary origins for the circadian clock – .
20967231:4	However, genes and pathways by which circadian oscillatory rhythms are generated in animals such as Drosophila and mammals are strongly conserved , implying a single origin of the clock in the metazoan lineage . Thus, it is of interest to identify and characterize the circadian clock in additional animals.
20967231:5	The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is well established as an excellent model organism for the study of development and behavior – . In their soil habitat, worms are subjected to temperature fluctuations corresponding to solar irradiance during the day–night cycles .
20967231:6	Moreover, when associated with surface-dwelling animals C. elegans is likely to be exposed to daily light–dark cycles.
20967231:7	Several studies have previously reported the presence of circadian rhythms in C. elegans . In these studies, growth-synchronized populations were entrained to light or temperature cycles, and circadian rhythms in behaviors such as locomotion or responses to osmotic stress were quantified – .
20967231:8	Although these experiments demonstrated the presence of rhythms with characteristics of true circadian oscillations, these rhythms were surprisingly variable and non-robust . In addition, while the C. elegans genome is predicted to encode homologs of most Drosophila and mammalian core clock components, the roles of these genes appear to be largely restricted to development . Thus, whether C. elegans exhibits bona fide circadian rhythms remains unclear.
20967231:9	Circadian rhythmicity in behavior and physiology has been proposed to be driven by clock-regulated oscillations in transcription and translation, and/or via post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications – . The expression of core clock genes such as per ( period ) and tim ( timeless ) as well as many clock output genes cycles at the transcriptional level in a circadian manner in Drosophila . Expression profiling experiments have, therefore, provided a powerful approach to identify clock genes as well as clock output genes under circadian transcriptional control – .
20967231:10	Since expression profiling is not biased by prior assumptions regarding a specific behavioral or physiological output, transcriptional rhythms may be a robust measure of the presence of a molecular circadian clock.
20967231:11	Here we identify light- and temperature-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and show that subsets of these transcripts are regulated in a circadian manner.
20967231:12	We find that light and temperature also globally drive the expression of many genes, indicating that C. elegans exhibits systemic responses to these stimuli.
20967231:13	Light- and temperature-entrained transcripts appear to be largely nonoverlapping.
20967231:14	We show that conserved clock gene homologs do not exhibit circadian rhythmicity at the mRNA level.
20967231:15	We also find that the TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit, previously implicated in thermosensory signal transduction and phototransduction – is required to transduce both light and temperature information to the clock(s).
20967231:16	These results demonstrate that C. elegans has circadian clock(s) that are entrained by light and temperature, and indicate that this model organism can be used to further explore the evolution and function of this critical timekeeping mechanism.
20967231:17	Results 
Discussion 
In the present study, we report the first identification, to our knowledge, of circadian-regulated transcripts in C. elegans . These transcripts are entrained by LD or WC cycles and continue to oscillate during free-running conditions with temperature-compensated periods and phases that are dependent on entraining conditions.
20967231:18	Both light and temperature can act as zeitgebers, and they drive as well as entrain transcripts at the genome-wide level.
20967231:19	Genome-wide circadian expression is regulated by environmental information received by a small set of sensory neuron(s), suggesting that, similar to observations in vertebrates, light and temperature information may act cell-nonautonomously to entrain the clock(s) in C. elegans . Our findings also imply that C. elegans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism that is distinct from that described previously in other animals.
20967231:20	In C. elegans as well as in Drosophila temperature cycles drive the expression of a larger set of genes than do light cycles . Genes implicated in metabolism appear to be enriched in the temperature-driven transcript sets, whereas genes implicated in circadian behaviors such as locomotion and reproduction are enriched in the entrained datasets in both organisms ( and this study).
20967231:21	However, there is a surprising lack of overlap between the temperature- and light-entrained datasets in C. elegans . In contrast, in Drosophila light and temperature cooperatively entrain a single transcriptional clock ,.
20967231:22	What does this almost complete lack of overlap between the two C. elegans entrained datasets imply?
20967231:23	At one extreme, light and temperature might act via different mechanisms to entrain two distinct clocks.
20967231:24	Multiple clocks within a single organism are not unprecedented although there is no evidence for a similar situation in metazoans.
20967231:25	On the contrary, Drosophila has only a single clock that runs in multiple cells and tissues .
20967231:26	Similarly, C. elegans may have a single clock that is entrained by light or temperature in different tissues.
20967231:27	In this scenario, the different locations may have completely distinct sets of output genes, accounting for the nonoverlapping datasets.
20967231:28	However, in this case, cycling clock mRNAs are expected to be shared in common between the two sets since in all eukaryotic circadian systems, from plants to mammals, many clock mRNAs undergo circadian oscillations at the transcriptional level , .
20967231:29	Since it is unlikely that a clock based on transcriptional feedback loops would have only one cycling mRNA (e.g., the swd-3.3 gene), C. elegans may have a novel clock mechanism.
20967231:30	Consistent with this hypothesis, homologs of animal clock genes do not cycle in C. elegans . Recent analysis has suggested that the ascidian Ciona intestinalis also has a divergent circadian clock, further suggesting multiple evolutionary origins of the animal circadian mechanism .
20967231:31	However, it remains possible that cycling clock mRNAs were not identified in our genome-wide studies because of masking by noncycling expression in other tissue types, or that clock proteins exhibit functional rhythmicity in C. elegans via post-translational modifications – .
20967231:32	An alternative possibility, consistent with the presence of a single clock, is that cycling clock mRNAs as well as common output genes are present in the two driven datasets.
20967231:33	These datasets have a statistically significant overlap, which is expected for clock and clock-regulated mRNAs.
20967231:34	However, these transcripts do not appear to maintain cycling in free-running conditions.
20967231:35	Although free-running rhythms are considered to be the sine qua non for circadian genes, some bona fide circadian rhythms damp quickly in constant conditions.
20967231:36	For example, Drosophila peripheral rhythms damp rapidly in the absence of a light–dark cycle, including transcriptional rhythms of the clock genes themselves .
20967231:37	Consistent with this scenario, we identified one of seven examined transcripts in the WC-driven datasets with characteristics of an entrained rather than a strictly driven transcript.
20967231:38	The number of entrained transcripts is, therefore, likely to be larger, and both clock mRNAs and shared output genes may be present within the set of entrained genes whose expression is severely dampened under constant conditions.
20967231:39	Further molecular and genetic analyses will allow us to distinguish among the above possibilities.
20967231:40	What are the behavioral consequences of circadian rhythmicity in C. elegans ?
20967231:41	Although locomotion has been reported to be under circadian control and genes implicated in locomotor behaviors are enriched in the WC-entrained dataset, this behavioral output does not appear to be particularly robust, and exhibits marked animal-to-animal variability . Locomotor behaviors in C. elegans are complex and can be dissected into multiple behavioral components – . Reported analyses of circadian locomotor behavior relied largely on quantification of gross overall movement , suggesting that detailed analyses of the underlying components may reveal more robust clock control.
20967231:42	Since reproduction-related genes are also enriched in the entrained datasets, additional biologically relevant behaviors such as egg-laying or mating may also be regulated in a circadian manner in C. elegans . Identification of circadian transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans now provides the necessary reagents to characterize the molecular identity, the neuronal circuits, and the behavioral consequences of clock function in this important model organism.

18616835:0	Background 
Flux balance analysis is becoming a well developed and frequently used theoretical tool to study the capabilities of large stoichiometric networks . Flux balance analysis relies on several assumptions that essentially impose constraints on the allowable states of a network.
18616835:1	Ideally, these constraints are derived from fundamental physical and chemical principles so that the physically realistic states of a network can be accurately identified and the unrealistic states ignored.
18616835:2	Ensuring the conservation of mass can be achieved in a relatively straightforward manner, but it is much more challenging to incorporate the conservation of energy [ - ].
18616835:3	Methods that rely on the identification of steady state reaction cycles have been developed to achieve this [ - ].
18616835:4	Knowledge of these cycles can be used to constrain the direction or magnitude of certain fluxes to prevent the occurrence of thermodynamically inconsistent network states.
18616835:5	The incorporation of energetic constraints in flux balance analysis is not the only motivation to identify cycles.
18616835:6	Cycles may also point towards important aspects of network function.
18616835:7	For instance, it has been proposed that cycles in metabolic networks can affect the sensitivity and robustness of network function and allow for regulation of biochemical pathways . In signal transduction networks, which are also stoichiometric in nature , cycles may allow for feedback.
18616835:8	Feedback is known to be an important property of signal transduction, and it has been shown to result in a variety of complex and potentially useful biochemical behaviors . 
Two algorithms have been explicitly described for the identification of steady state cycles in stoichiometric networks.
18616835:9	Schilling, Letscher, and Palsson (SLP) described the first of these in 2000 . The SLP algorithm first defines a network of internal and exchange reactions.
18616835:10	Internal reactions are those that are actually being studied.
18616835:11	For metabolic networks, for example, the internal reactions are those that occur in or around the cell, such as reactions involved in glycolysis, respiration, transport of metabolites across cellular membranes, etc.
18616835:12	Exchange reactions are pseudo-reactions that are used to supply (remove) chemical species to (from) the reaction system.
18616835:13	The flux, or rate, of each internal reaction is constrained to be positive, while the fluxes of exchange reactions may be left unconstrained.
18616835:14	If reversible reactions are present in the network, they are broken apart into a pair of unidirectional forward-reverse reactions, each with its own flux.
18616835:15	These reactions are used to construct a stoichiometry matrix S which is used to formulate the equation Sv = 0 where v is a vector of fluxes of all reactions in the network.
18616835:16	The solutions to this equation represent the allowable steady states of the network, where steady refers to the fact that the concentrations of internal chemical species remain constant.
18616835:17	The SLP algorithm then identifies all of the extreme pathways of a network, which are a unique set of flux vectors whose superposition can generate all steady-state fluxes in a network that do not violate the principle of mass conservation.
18616835:18	The extreme pathways are then categorized based on the types of active reactions they contain.
18616835:19	We use the word cycles from this point forward to refer exclusively to internal cycles, that is type III extreme pathways, which are the extreme pathways that do not contain active exchange reactions ( and see Appendix).
18616835:20	Type III extreme pathways are also elementary flux modes  and extremal currents . The identification of extreme pathways is equivalent to computing the set of extreme rays of a convex cone , which is known to be an NP-hard problem [ , ].
18616835:21	This computational complexity limits the size of networks for which the SLP algorithm can be used , although numerous algorithmic improvements have been recently made in an effort to alleviate this problem [ - ].
18616835:22	Mahadevan and Schilling (MS) very briefly described the second algorithm for cycle identification in 2003 . In this approach, the network and its corresponding stoichiometry matrix are defined in the same way as for the SLP algorithm.
18616835:23	The MS algorithm, however, uses a unique property of cycles to assist with their detection.
18616835:24	If a network does not contain exchange reactions, and the fluxes of all internal reactions are constrained to the interval [0, ∞), the only reactions in the network capable of functioning will be those that participate in cycles (see Appendix).
18616835:25	The MS algorithm takes advantage of this fact by using linear programming to determine the maximum flux of each reaction in the network.
18616835:26	All of the reactions with unbounded fluxes are then used to create a sub-network of the original network.
18616835:27	Every reaction in this sub-network necessarily participates in a cycle of the original network (see Appendix).
18616835:28	The SLP algorithm is then applied to the sub-network to identify all of its extreme pathways, which are necessarily the complete set of cycles in the original network (see Appendix).
18616835:29	Since the sub-network supplied to the SLP algorithm is potentially smaller than the original network, the identification of cycles in larger networks may become possible.
18616835:30	In this paper, we describe a new algorithm, which we refer to here as the WW algorithm.
18616835:31	The WW algorithm is an extension of the MS algorithm, and it can reduce the size of the sub-network supplied to the SLP algorithm far beyond that of the MS algorithm.
18616835:32	We also measure and compare, for the first time, the performances of all three algorithms using five genome-scale metabolic networks.
18616835:33	Results and Discussion 
Conclusion 
The WW algorithm consistently achieves significant performance improvements over both the MS and SLP algorithms for the microbial networks we examined.
18616835:34	For these networks, the execution time and maximum memory consumption of the WW algorithm are both smaller by multiple factors.
18616835:35	The scaling behavior of the WW algorithm as a function of network size is also preferable to both the MS and SLP algorithms.
18616835:36	Due to combinatorial explosion during extreme pathway identification, however, all of the algorithms fail to identify the cycles within the human metabolic network.
18616835:37	At this point in time, the WW algorithm appears to be the best choice for identifying steady state cycles in large, real-world stoichiometric networks, although additional algorithmic innovation is clearly desirable.

18616835:40	Appendix 
The following is a list of properties of extreme pathways that have been published previously , and a list of logical deductions we make based on these properties.
18616835:41	Each of these properties and deductions is very simple, but taken together, they lead to the principle (Deduction 8) that allows the WW algorithm to be much more efficient than its predecessors.
18616835:42	Property 1. Extreme pathways are composed of the minimum number of reactions needed to function (that is, to have non-zero flux) at steady state . 
Property 2.
18616835:43	Extreme pathways are systematically independent, that is, extreme pathways cannot be composed of other extreme pathways . 
Property 3.
18616835:44	Type III extreme pathways contain only internal reactions, that is, they never contain exchange reactions.
18616835:45	All other types of extreme pathways contain at least one exchange reaction . 
Deduction 1. Given Property 1, if any reaction is removed from an extreme pathway, or inactivated by constraining its flux to zero, the entire pathway is rendered inactive, that is, the flux of each reaction in the pathway must be zero.
18616835:46	Deduction 2. Given Property 1, an extreme pathway can be viewed as a single, independent functional unit.
18616835:47	For example, if all reactions in a network are inactivated, except those participating in a given extreme pathway, that particular pathway can still have non-zero flux.
18616835:48	Deduction 3. Given Property 1, a single unidirectional internal reaction can never be an extreme pathway, because it cannot function at steady state by itself (excluding 'null' reactions, like A → A).
18616835:49	Deduction 4.
18616835:50	A pair of unidirectional forward-reverse reactions can form a type III extreme pathway.
18616835:51	The pair can function at steady state without the need for other reactions and only by functioning together, satisfying Property 1.
18616835:52	The pair cannot be composed of other extreme pathways, since a single reaction can never be an extreme pathway (Deduction 3), satisfying Property 2.
18616835:53	Deduction 5.
18616835:54	If an extreme pathway is composed of only two unidirectional reactions, they must be a forward-reverse reaction pair (R F, R R). The only way a reaction pair can maintain steady state concentrations is if R R consumes the products of R F at the same rate that R F consumes the products of R R. 
Deduction 6. Given Properties 1 and 2, and Deduction 4, an extreme pathway composed of more than two reactions can never contain a forward-reverse reaction pair.
18616835:55	Deduction 7. Given Property 3 and Deduction 2, if the exchange reactions in a stoichiometric network are removed, only type III extreme pathways will remain.
18616835:56	(Note, however, that the set of type III pathways in a network may change as a result of exchange reaction removal.)
18616835:57	Deduction 8.
18616835:58	If a unidirectional internal reaction R is active (i.e. its flux is greater than zero), all reverse reactions of R are inactivated (i.e. their fluxes have been constrained to zero), and the network contains no exchange reactions, R necessarily participates in a type III extreme pathway composed of more than two reactions.

19504049:0	Background 
In 1686 the Swedish church started to keep local registers of parish members, and population statistics began in 1749  (Personal communication: Marie Lennersand, 8th Jan, 2009).
19504049:1	This enabled the church, and through the church also the Swedish state, to keep a population census and to enrol soldiers for the army.
19504049:2	The personal identity number (PIN) was introduced in 1947 and then consisted of date of birth and a three-digit number.
19504049:3	From 1947 and onwards, every individual that has resided in Sweden on a permanent basis (and been recorded in the Total population register, TPR) has been assigned a PIN.
19504049:4	In 1967, a check digit was added to the three-digit number.
19504049:5	The check digit verifies that data of birth and the three-digit number are correct.
19504049:6	In 1991, when the responsibility for the local population registers was moved from the local parishes to the local tax offices, the National Tax Board took over the full responsibility for the Swedish PIN.
19504049:7	When the local population registers were computerized in 1967, Statistics Sweden established the TPR.
19504049:8	In 1997, the National Tax Board initiated a new notification system with partially new data.
19504049:9	As of today (year 2009), all notifications are delivered from the National Tax Board to other administrations, including Statistics Sweden, on a daily basis.
19504049:10	Statistics Sweden stores all notifications with updates in a notification database.
19504049:11	Although there are earlier accounts of the Swedish PIN system , these have seldom discussed the structure of the PIN in detail, and potential pitfalls of using the PIN in a medical or scientific context.
19504049:12	The main purpose of this study was to examine the PIN from different angels with a focus on its use in Swedish health care and medical research.
19504049:13	A second purpose was to explore ethical issues of the use of PIN in medical research.
19504049:14	Results 
Special conditions of the PIN 
PINs in the other Nordic countries 
Many countries have PIN systems or similar systems, sometimes based on insurance numbers.
19504049:15	Below is a short presentation of the PIN system in Denmark, Finland and Norway.
19504049:16	Also Iceland has a PIN system.
19504049:17	Discussion 
This paper describes the Swedish PIN.
19504049:18	The Swedish PIN consists of the date of birth, a three-digit birth number and a check digit.
19504049:19	The PIN is of great importance in Swedish society and is extensively used in routine health care as well as in medical research.
19504049:20	It is the foundation for all large-scale medical register linkages.
19504049:21	Similar PIN systems are used in Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland . 
The large number of individuals with (true or wrongly assigned) birth dates in the 1950s and 1960s illustrates the risk of a shortage of PINs.
19504049:22	Due to the current construction of the PIN, there are a maximum of 500 male and 499 female PINs, and it has been estimated that in 5 years PINs referring to certain days of births will not be available . Also in the future, will Sweden and other counties face large numbers of migrants with birthdays on the 1st of Jan and the 1st of July.
19504049:23	Increased awareness of the high stress on the current PIN system has led to a government investigation on the future structure of the PIN.
19504049:24	Given that a lot of the digital infrastructure in Sweden is conditioned on a 10–12 digits PIN (12 digits when the PIN includes the century), the Swedish Council of Legislation is currently considering a change of law, that would allow future immigrants for which there are no PINs corresponding to their birth date, to be assigned a PIN where the “day position” corresponds to a date just before or after his/her actual birth date.
19504049:25	Information on the exact date of birth would, however, be stored separately in the TPR.
19504049:26	There are no plans to change existing PINs or the structure of the coordination numbers . 
The presence of incorrect and/or re-used PINs among Swedish residents constitutes a potential pitfall for Swedish medical researchers and health care workers.
19504049:27	Matching between large datasets where individuals with identical PIN occur more than twice in both datasets may result in mismatching with risk of incorrect data.
19504049:28	Unawareness of the fact that medical events in one individual may have been attached to two or three different PINs will result in an underestimation of morbidity.
19504049:29	These problems can be solved through an active communication between the researcher, Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health Care at time of register linkage.
19504049:30	However, it is also recommended that the medical researcher scrutinize the delivered dataset with respect to e.g. age and calendar year distribution, as well as the number of positive outcomes to detect possible errors.
19504049:31	Ethical aspects on the use of PIN 
The main reason for using the PIN in the Swedish health care is to promote the medical care of individual patients.
19504049:32	Such care includes investigation and treatment for a vast range of disorders, some life-threatening (e.g. Crohn’s disease or a traffic accident) while others only qualify as mild complaints (having a cold).
19504049:33	To manage patients effectively, especially over time physicians need a unique identifier.
19504049:34	The patient with Crohn’s disease may develop fistulas.
19504049:35	Through the PIN an earlier history of hypersensitivity to Infliximab is easier to trace, and the physician may then choose a more appropriate treatment than Infliximab.
19504049:36	Comparison of spinal x-rays in a patient who has suffered from a traffic accident, and the x-rays taken 6 weeks earlier on the day of trauma, may yield crucial information on the prognosis of the patient.
19504049:37	It is unquestionable that access to stored medical data through the use of the PIN is of great importance to the diagnostics, and treatment of many patients.
19504049:38	But the PIN also allows medical data to be used for educational purposes, research and quality assurance schemes . Large medical databases such as the Swedish Cancer Register or the Swedish Patient Register, built around the PIN, create additional value to society.
19504049:39	The PIN enables researchers to merge such registers and to examine an array of questions, including the long-term consequences of preterm birth  or certain diseases , the medical consequences of alcohol abuse , or the association between a medical event and human behaviour . Hence, the PIN allows researchers to estimate morbidity and mortality in patients.
19504049:40	Such research will not only optimize health care resource allocation but more importantly improve the management of both current and future patients.
19504049:41	Through the PIN it is possible to trace virtually any patient.
19504049:42	The medical outcome of a patient (e.g. with increasing age a prostate cancer may become obvious) can be used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic techniques tested on both historic and new blood samples.
19504049:43	Finally, the natural course of disease (as recorded in registers and patient charts) serves to educate medical students.
19504049:44	The fact that historic medical data often benefit the patient him-/herself is an important reason why individual patients cannot withhold or withdraw their medical data from the national health registers, or request that such register data be anonymised (i.e. that all links to their PIN is deleted).
19504049:45	Such rights would harm both medical care and the quality of medical research.
19504049:46	Considering that withholding data is not an option for Swedish patients it is difficult to estimate the proportion of individuals who had this been possible would have requested anonymisation, deletion or restricted use of their medical data.
19504049:47	However, in a study on patient’s refusal to consent to storage and use of samples in Swedish biobanks  only 1 in 690 patients objected to the storage and use of such data for research purposes, and even fewer were willing to complete a dissent form.
19504049:48	Although a refusal of 1/690 individual will not affect study power in medical research, such refusals may cause some bias since they are unlikely to be non-differential with regards to background factors, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and morbidity.
19504049:49	According to current Swedish regulation, the use of national register data for research purposes does not require informed consent.
19504049:50	We argue that the current situation benefits patients and society, and that informed consent should not be required for large-scale medical research.
19504049:51	A number of arguments can be put forward to defend this ethical position (equally relevant to biobank data ). 
(1) Some patients will not understand the consequences of their objections to the use of register-based health data.
19504049:52	(2) The impossibility to acquire the approval of everyone would reduce the statistical power of most studies.
19504049:53	(3) There is an obvious risk that consent would be especially difficult to obtain in high-risk groups where positive outcomes are most frequent, in children, and in immigrants with limited knowledge of the Swedish language.
19504049:54	This conflicts with the principle of justice and equality  that stipulates that individuals should not be discriminated against due to inability to consent or to understand the meaning or need of medical research.
19504049:55	(4) Relatives may find questions on the use of medical data from their “dead mother or father” for research purposes lacking in respect.
19504049:56	(5) The costs of obtaining the consent of millions of patients with health data would be exorbitant and prohibit most large-scale research.
19504049:57	The cost is however not always a valid argument, and in small-scale register-linkages it may be feasible to seek patients’ consent before carrying out the study.
19504049:58	Finally (6), it should be remembered that the public is not without voice in matters of any medical research (including that based on the PIN).
19504049:59	When a register contains identifiable data (through the PIN, name or any other unique identifier), each individual has a right to obtain a copy of his/her data in that register.
19504049:60	Furthermore, it is preferable to inform the public of large-scale ongoing research projects through the media, including what groups of people are being involved (e.g. men born between 1913 and 1923).
19504049:61	Hence, it may be concluded, that although large-scale register-based studies do not routinely involve personal consent), researchers in Sweden are nevertheless expected to protect the integrity of participating individuals and meet the demands of study participants whenever possible.
19504049:62	Whenever register-based data based on the PIN will be used, the medical project is reviewed by an Ethics review-board.
19504049:63	This review-board is a guarantor that the rights of individuals incapable of consent (e.g. children and older people) are protected.
19504049:64	Although, the review-board will allow most PIN-based register-linkages, the PINs of the merged data will almost without exception be removed and replaced by unique serial numbers by the National Board of Health and Welfare or Statistics Sweden before being delivered to the researchers.
19504049:65	Furthermore the researchers are obliged to sign a contract where they agree to secure storage of the data-set, and never to back-track the identity of patients in the anonymised data-set.
19504049:66	We suggest these precautionary measures are sufficient to protect the integrity of patients, and that informed consent should not be needed when performing large register-based research.
19504049:67	Conclusions 
In conclusion, the Swedish PIN serves as a unique identifier in Swedish health care, and in many other areas of the Swedish society.
19504049:68	Furthermore, the PIN is the key variable in all large register linkages in Swedish medical research.
19504049:69	Together with (1) the comprehensive national public health system that represents close to 100% of all Swedish health care; and (2) the National health registers, the PIN is the pillar of register-based medical research in Sweden.
19504049:70	The benefits of using the PIN in medical research override the potential harm.

null:0	Purpose of the study 
Darunavir (DRV) is a second generation protease inhibitor (PI), first licensed for use in 2006.
null:1	It is indicated for use in a treatment experienced population and is effective in vitro against both wild type and PI-resistant HIV.
null:2	As a relatively new drug there is little published information on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir in pregnancy.
null:3	Here we examine the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir [DRV/r 800/100mg once daily (OD)] in two women, over the course of pregnancy and postpartum.
null:4	Methods 
A prospective open labelled study was established to enrol HIV positive pregnant women on DRV/r as part of their routine maternity care.
null:5	DRV plasma trough concentrations were determined in the first (T1) and/or second (T2) and/or third (T3) trimester using a validated HPLC-MS/MS methodology with a limit quantification of 16 ng/ml.
null:6	Postpartum (PP) sampling was also performed.
null:7	Summary of results 
To date two women have been recruited.
null:8	Both were black African and initiated treatment prior to pregnancy.
null:9	Each woman was virally suppressed (HIV RNA <50 cpm) throughout pregnancy and had CD4 cell counts >300 cells/mm 3 (range 341-470).
null:10	Patient 1 had a TDM sample drawn in each trimester and at PP.
null:11	DRV concentrations in T1 [3790ng/ml], T2 [1285ng/ml] and T3 [1773ng/ml] were considerably (27-75%) lower relative to concentrations at PP [5227ng/ml].
null:12	Patient 2 had TDM samples taken in T2 and PP only.
null:13	Again a considerably lower (~72%) DRV concentration was noted at T2 compared with PP.
null:14	In both cases, DRV concentrations in pregnancy and postpartum were above the accepted minimum effective concentration for wt virus (MEC; 550 ng/ml, based on in vitro studies).
null:15	Conclusions 
In the two cases examined, DRV/r (800/100mg, OD) was effective at achieving adequate therapeutic drug levels (>550ng/ml) during pregnancy.
null:16	However, reduced DRV plasma concentrations in the second/third trimesters, highlights the need for TDM in this population, and warrants further study of pregnancy-associated changes in DRV pharmacokinetics.

18498645:0	Background 
Classic and non-classic HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class I genes play a central role in the regulation of the immune response.
18498645:1	The non-classic HLA-G gene is expressed in a variety of tissues but perhaps most notably in the fetal-maternal interface on the extravillous cytotrophoblast and has been postulated to help protect the fetus from maternal allorecognition .
18498645:2	This hypothesis is supported by subsequent studies demonstrating that HLA-G proteins can suppress a variety of immune functions including natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytolysis and the T-cell proliferative response . Recent findings indicate that HLA-G antigens are present in ovarian and various other types of malignant cells and tissues [ - ].
18498645:3	These findings and others have led to the hypothesis that induction of HLA-G expression in tumor cells may contribute to their avoidance of immunosurveillance by the host  (but disputed by ).
18498645:4	Sequences known to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of most HLA class I genes are disrupted in the HLA-G gene raising questions as to the mechanisms underlying HLA-G expression [ - ].
18498645:5	Studies conducted in a variety of human cancer cell lines suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in HLA-G expression . To explore the potential role of DNA methylation on HLA-G expression in ovarian cancer, we tested the effect of the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine on methylation within the CpG-enriched regulatory region of the HLA-G gene and correlated changes in expression in an ovarian cancer cell line.
18498645:6	The results demonstrate that 5-aza-dC treatment results in hypomethylation of putative control sequences within the 5' regulatory region of HLA-G and that these changes in methylation correlate with a significant increase in expression.
18498645:7	A notable exception was a region (-211 to -290) containing a hypoxia response element (HRE; ) that remained completely methylated.
18498645:8	Methylation within the regulatory region of the HLA-G gene also was examined in eighteen malignant and benign ovarian tumor samples and in ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSE) isolated from four patients with normal ovaries.
18498645:9	A number of significant differences in levels of methylation of sequences within the 5' regulatory region were detected between the tumor samples and the normal surface epithelial cells.
18498645:10	Interestingly, the region containing the HRE (-211 to -290) that remained methylated in 5-aza-dC treated BG-1 cells was also completely methylated in all ovarian tumor samples, but not in OSE controls, suggesting strong selection against accessibility to the HRE in ovarian tumor cells.
18498645:11	Although the highest levels of HLA-G expression were associated with tumor samples, no significant overall correlation between methylation and expression levels was detected by real time RT-PCR.
18498645:12	Our results indicate that alterations in methylation may be necessary but not sufficient for HLA-G expression in ovarian tumors.
18498645:13	Results 
Discussion 
Contrary to other HLA molecules, HLA-G regulation is only partially understood.
18498645:14	Studies of the methylation levels of 450 bp of the promoter region of HLA-G in melanoma and choriocarcinoma cell lines showed a correlation between expression and low levels of methylation . In our study we looked at the same region in the ovarian cancer cell line BG-1, which showed almost complete methylation of all CpG dinucleotides and no expression of HLA-G . Treatment of the cells with the methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-dC, resulted in a significant decrease in levels of methylation at the HLA-G promoter region that correlated with an increase in levels of HLA-G expression (Figures and ).
18498645:15	Consistent with previously published studies conducted with other cancer cell lines , our results suggest that the methylation status of the HLA-G promoter region may be important for the control of HLA-G expression in ovarian cancer.
18498645:16	To test this hypothesis in tissues, we analyzed methylation of the HLA-G 5' regulatory region in 4 OSE samples and 18 malignant and benign ovarian tumor samples.
18498645:17	In addition, we measured the relative levels of HLA-G expression in 11 OSE and ovarian tumor samples from which cancer cells were isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM).
18498645:18	We found that there were significant differences in levels of methylation within the 5' HLA-G regulatory region between OSE and the malignant and benign ovarian tumor samples, but no significant difference between the malignant and benign tumor samples.
18498645:19	This observation is consistent with the view that any putative adaptive advantage imparted to tumor cells by HLA-G apparently does not distinguish between malignant and benign tumor cells.
18498645:20	We found that many of the CpG sites displaying a significant decrease in methylation in the tumor samples were located in proximity to intact binding sites of regulatory proteins known to serve as activators of gene expression (CCAAT box -76 and an intact SP1 and RFX binding site within the X1 box at -130 ; Figure ).
18498645:21	Hypomethylation of these sites in ovarian tumors may serve to potentiate HLA-G expression.
18498645:22	In contrast, we observed a significant increase in levels of methylation in tumor samples at CpG sites located in proximity to a hypoxia response element  located 243 bp upstream of the HLA-G transcriptional start site.
18498645:23	Interestingly, this same region remained methylated in 5-aza-dC treated BG-1 cells, suggesting that strong selection may operate to prevent binding to the HRE in ovarian tumor cells.
18498645:24	HRE is the binding site of HIF-1, a protein that plays a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, with the potential to act as either a positive or negative regulatory factor [ - ].
18498645:25	Evidence has recently been reported that HIF-1 may act as a negative regulator of HLA-G expression in some human melanoma (FON) and choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cell lines  The functional significance of the methylation of the CpG island surrounding the HIF-1 binding site in the ovarian tumor samples remains to be determined.
18498645:26	However, preventing the binding of a potential repressor protein (HIF-1) may help maintain the transcription of HLA-G in ovarian tumors under hypoxic conditions thus allowing the tumor cells to evade cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition and destruction.
18498645:27	It is important to keep in mind that the postulated significance of methylation changes in gene regulatory regions is the increased (hypomethylation) or decreased (hypermethylation) access it provides for the binding of proteins or protein complexes that regulate gene expression . Thus, although methylation changes in gene regulatory regions may be necessary for subsequent changes in levels of expression, these changes in methylation alone may not be sufficient to effect expression changes.
18498645:28	The fact that the significant differences in methylation we observed between OSE and ovarian tumor samples do not correlate with differences in HLA-G expression may serve to underlie this distinction.
18498645:29	Our results are consistent with a scenario whereby changes in methylation in ovarian tumor cells potentiate them for HLA-G transcriptional activation (or avoidance of transcriptional repression) by regulatory proteins induced by micro-environmental or mutational changes in specific tumor cell lineages.
18498645:30	Conclusion 
Differences in methylation within the 5' regulatory region of HLA-G were detected between normal ovarian surface epithelial cells and ovarian cancers.
18498645:31	The most striking difference was in a region (-211 to -290 from HLA-G TSS), containing an intact hypoxia response element (HRE).
18498645:32	This region was completely methylated in all of the ovarian tumor (malignant and benign) samples examined, but was only variably methylated in normal surface epithelial cells.
18498645:33	Interestingly, this same region remained completely methylated in an ovarian cancer cell line (BG-1) after treatment with 5-aza-dC suggesting that there is strong selection against loss of methylation in this region in these ovarian cancer cells.
18498645:34	Since HRE is the binding site of a known repressor of HLA-G expression (HIF-1), we hypothesize that methylation of the region surrounding the HRE may help maintain the potential for expression of HLA-G in ovarian tumors.
18498645:35	The fact that no correlation exists between methylation and HLA-G gene expression between ovarian tumor samples and OSE, leads us to conclude that changes in methylation may be necessary but not sufficient for HLA-G expression in ovarian cancer.

null:0	Background 
The term Metacognition refers to the psychological processes that are involved in the way a person controls, modifies, and appraises his own thoughts . Maladaptive metacognitions have been related to the development and maintenance of psychological disorder . The Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30) is a multidimensional instrument for assessing metacognitions, composed of five factors: cognitive confidence, positive beliefs about worry, cognitive self consciousness, negative beliefs about worry and need to control thoughts . Psychometric properties of the MCQ-30 have been well documented  suggesting that it is a valid instrument that has already been used in clinical research with several psychiatric disorders.

17420625:0	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The study was designed as a multicenter, retrospective collection of cases with using a case reporting form.
17420625:1	Only patients who underwent an IA recanalization procedure due to acute anterior circulation ischemia in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and this was performed within the past five years, were included in this review.
17420625:2	The case reporting form was provided to each enrolled institute.
17420625:3	This form included the basic clinical information, the initial imaging results, the angiography and procedure-related information, the follow-up imaging results and the clinical outcome of each patient together with the actual imaging data.
17420625:4	We requested that the clinical and procedure-related parts of the form be filled out by the radiologist at each center.
17420625:5	The basic clinical information included age, gender, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at the time of presentation and the presence of underlying diabetes, hypertension and/or heart disease.
17420625:6	Selection of the initial imaging modality, the time from symptom onset to the time of imaging, the time from symptom onset to the initiation of angiography (the first angiographic run), and the time of day of the procedure (i.e., during or after working hours) were analyzed.
17420625:7	The pre- and post-procedure CT/MR images and angiographic findings were evaluated by the board-certified radiologist who had more than five years of experience with IA thrombolysis.
17420625:8	The CT results were analyzed for the presence of early CT signs, involvement of basal ganglia and the presence of hyperdense MCA signs.
17420625:9	The MR findings were analyzed to determine the extent of the lesion on the diffusion-weighted images (DWI), involvement of the basal ganglia, the presence of perfusion/diffusion mismatch and presence of microbleeds.
17420625:10	The angiographic results were analyzed for the anatomic location of the culprit steno-occlusive lesions and the initial and post-procedure Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grades.
17420625:11	We regarded a post-procedure TIMI grade of II or III as indicative of successful recanalization.
17420625:12	The immediate post-procedure CT was reviewed for the presence of hemorrhages and parenchymal hyperdensity that was observed due to the contrast media used during the thrombolytic procedure.
17420625:13	The follow-up CT or MR findings were analyzed for occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation, which was evaluated by the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) classification method.
17420625:14	We calculated the rates of occurrence of any hemorrhage and any radiologically significant hemorrhage, with the latter regarded as hemorrhage with a mass effect, such as parenchymal hematoma type 2 or some cases of hemorrhagic infarction type 2.
17420625:15	These rates were surrogate indicators of symptomatic hemorrhages.
17420625:16	The clinical outcome analysis was performed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which was recorded at various time points after the procedure (at 1-12 months, except for the patients who died in the interim).
17420625:17	If the clinical outcome data were not available, the case was dropped from the clinical outcome analysis.
17420625:18	We calculated the percentage of patients with each mRS score, as well as the mortality rate, which was defined as the rate of procedure-related deaths within one month.
17420625:19	Univariate logistic regression methods were used to analyze the factors that had an influence on successful recanalization, significant hemorrhagic transformation and poor functional outcome results.
17420625:20	The proportion of patients with a mRS of more than 3 was used for the latter.
17420625:21	Variables with p values less than 0.05 on the univariate analyses were chosen as the variables for the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
17420625:22	In both analyses, p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
17420625:23	RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
The results of our analysis provide an overview on the current practice status of IA thrombolysis in Korea.
17420625:24	Although more than 30 centers in Korea actively perform neurointerventional procedures (see the 2005 member list of the Korean Society of Interventional Neuroradiology), only seven of these centers participated in this study.
17420625:25	It is likely that many of the other centers have been reluctant to perform IA thrombolysis, primarily due to a shortage of trained personnel.
17420625:26	In Western countries also, IA thrombolysis is performed less frequently than the IV method due to a shortage of interventional specialists.
17420625:27	We found that from the symptom onset, the mean time before the imaging was 2.3 hours, and the mean time before the treatment was 4.7 hours; these results are comparable with those reported in the PROACT II Trial.
17420625:28	The mean delay between the CT and MR imaging was about 60 min, which was one of the in-hospital delay factors for IA thrombolysis.
17420625:29	About 40% of these procedures were performed before or after normal working hours, and the functional outcome results of these patients were generally poorer than those of the patients who were treated during normal working hours.
17420625:30	One of the primary reasons for the poorer outcome in the former group of patients may be the in-hospital delay.
17420625:31	A well-organized stroke team and an on-call system may improve the results for these patients.
17420625:32	One notable finding of our survey was the preference for MR as the initial imaging modality.
17420625:33	MR was the sole initial imaging modality in 39% of patients, and it was combined with the CT imaging in 33%.
17420625:34	Although MR has the potential disadvantage of time delay, it has shown an advantage for the initial evaluation of acute ischemic stroke ( - ).
17420625:35	However, a delay in the initiation of the optimal treatment due to logistic limitations of MR imaging cannot be justified.
17420625:36	Many centers use multi-detector CT imaging to overcome the inevitable logistic limitation of MR imaging.
17420625:37	It was notable that about 10% of the cases in the study were in violation of the 'one-third rule', which is one of the most important exclusion criteria of the European thrombolysis trial and the PROACT II trial.
17420625:38	Out of all the patients evaluated by the MR imaging, 26% showed DWI lesions covering more than half of the involved vascular territory.
17420625:39	This was probably due to a lack of certain inclusion or exclusion criteria for MR imaging in respect to the patient selection for IA thrombolysis.
17420625:40	Although we limited our study to patients with anterior circulation infarction and so increasing the homogeneity of the study group, we found a wide variation in the occlusion site, from the proximal ICA to the proximal portion of the MCA.
17420625:41	Our observed recanalization rate, 71%, was slightly higher than that reported in the PROACT II trial, which may have been due, at least in part, to the liberal use of mechanical methods.
17420625:42	We were disappointed to find that only one factor, the lower initial NIHSS score, had a significant effect on the successful recanalization rate.
17420625:43	In contrast to reports on the combined or sequential thrombolytic treatments ( - ), we found that the use of IV thrombolytics prior to the IA procedure did not affect the recanalization rate.
17420625:44	However, in many of these patients, however, the initial IV administration of thrombolytics was ineffective.
17420625:45	About half of the patients received a combination of IA and mechanical thrombolysis, although the use of mechanical methods failed to improve the recanalization rate ( p = 0.083).
17420625:46	One of the major concerns after the IA thrombolytic treatment is hemorrhagic transformation of the affected lesion.
17420625:47	We found that the rate of any amount hemorrhagic transformation was 35%, and the rate of the significant hemorrhagic transformation was 13%.
17420625:48	The univariate analysis showed that several factors that had influence on significant hemorrhagic transformation, including the presence of hypertension, severe initial neurological symptoms, involvement of the basal ganglia on CT/MR and the performance of procedures after normal working hours.
17420625:49	In addition, the risk of significant hemorrhage was increased by the presence of any contrast density on the CT obtained immediately after the thrombolysis procedure.
17420625:50	Violation of the one-third rule on the initial CT tended to increase the occurrence of significant hemorrhage ( p = 0.08), whereas extensive involvement of the affected vascular territory on the DWI ( p = 0.51) and the combined use of IV thrombolytics and mechanical methods had no effect.
17420625:51	Although direct comparison is not possible because of the differences in the patient groups, the functional outcome in our series of patients was similar to that of other major thrombolysis trials.
17420625:52	Among the factors that were found to influence the poor functional outcome were the old age, severe initial neurological symptoms, more extensive initial DWI lesions and involvement of basal ganglia on MR, failed recanalization, any contrast staining on CT immediately after the procedure and the presence of significant hemorrhagic transformation.
17420625:53	Other studies have found that these same factors were predictive of poor prognosis ( , ).
17420625:54	The primary limitations of this analysis were its retrospective design and the collection of data from several centers, all of which had different clinical and imaging indications for the procedure and different clinical settings.
17420625:55	In addition, the data we collected were not representative of practice throughout Korea because only a few active centers contributed to the study.
17420625:56	Due to our inability to collect some data from the participating centers, we were unable to perform appropriate multivariate analyses.
17420625:57	This could be one of the possible reasons for our failure to determine any significant variables that affected the results of significant hemorrhagic transformation and poor functional outcomes.
17420625:58	Furthermore, our analysis of the imaging data was limited due to the between-center differences in the imaging protocols, including the use of contrast enhancement, MR pulse sequences and the angiographic filming techniques.
17420625:59	Nevertheless, the results presented here may be representative of the nation-wide data on current IA thrombolytic treatment, and they could serve as a basis for clinical practice guidelines, as well as for designing a prospective study on the basis of this protocol.
17420625:60	In conclusion, our multicenter, retrospective analysis of IA thrombolysis showed an increased dependency on MR imaging during the initial patient evaluation and increased application of combined pharmacologic/mechanical thrombolysis in Korea.
17420625:61	Both our imaging and clinical outcome results were comparable with those of the other major thrombolytic trials.
17420625:62	Our results could be used as the basis for clinical practice and for future prospective studies.
18958151:0	Introduction 
Neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have gained widespread attention due to their therapeutic utility in managing numerous neurological/psychiatric diseases . The field of neural control has recently made significant advances by demonstrations of millisecond optical control of individual neurons and synapses in intact brain circuits . Ultrasound (US) as a means of exciting and reversibly suppressing neuronal activity was shown to be effective on a gross level several decades ago.
18958151:1	Since then however, explorations into the use of US as a neurostimulation tool have been relatively sparse.
18958151:2	The focus has instead been on employing more traditional approaches such as pharmacological, electrical, magnetic, and photonic stimulation of neuronal circuits.
18958151:3	Coupling its ability to interact with biological tissues and its noninvasive transmission through skull bone and other biological tissues in a focused manner – US holds promise as a potentially powerful neurostimulation tool , which may be capable of replacing currently invasive DBS strategies.
18958151:4	Ultrasound can produce bioeffects by acting through thermal and/or non-thermal mechanisms as it propagates through tissues in pulsed or continuous waveforms – . Therapeutic US can be broadly characterized as low-power/low-intensity or high-power/high-intensity . High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) used in the thermal ablation of tissue implements peak power levels often exceeding 1000 W/cm 2, whereas non-thermal therapeutic effects of US have been well described at power levels ranging from 30–500 mW/cm 2 – . 
Modulation of ionic conductance produced by adiabatic processes as US propagates rapidly and transiently through cellular membranes may alter the activity of individual neurons due to the elastic nature of lipid bilayers and the spring-like mechanics of many transmembrane protein channels.
18958151:5	In partial support of this hypothesis, low-power US has been shown to influence the membrane conductance of frog skin epidermis . In addition, US exposure can induce a reversible increase in the internal Ca 2+ concentration of fibroblasts . In rat thymocytes, stimulation with US can modulate K + influx and efflux . Interestingly, many voltage-gated ion channels, as well as neurotransmitter receptors possess mechanosensitive properties that render their gating kinetics sensitive to transient changes in lipid bilayer tension . Whether or not ion channels can be modulated by US in neurons has remained unknown.
18958151:6	Several investigations have demonstrated however that US modulates neuronal activity by enhancing and/or suppressing the amplitudes and/or conduction velocities of evoked nerve potentials , – . 
In a pioneering study, Fry and colleagues (1950) first demonstrated US is capable of modulating neuronal activity by reporting the temporary suppression of spontaneous activity following US transmission through crayfish ventral nerve cords . Transmitting US through the lateral geniculate nucleus of intact cats, Fry and colleagues (1958) demonstrated that high-power US reversibly suppressed light-evoked potentials recorded in the visual cortex . Rinaldi and colleagues (1991) demonstrated that 2.5 to 15 min irradiation of hippocampal slices with 0.75 MHz US (temporal average intensity; I TA ∼80 W/cm 2), significantly reduces the amplitude of evoked potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons.
18958151:7	In the dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices, focused US pulses have been shown to both enhance and suppress electrically evoked field potentials . In cat saphenous nerve bundles it has been demonstrated that focused US is capable of differentially effecting Aδ- and C-fibers depending on the intensity and duration of US irradiation . In excised frog sciatic nerve bundles, Tsui and colleagues (2005) reported that a temporal average intensity of 1 W/cm 2 continuous wave (5 min) US (3.5 MHz) increased the amplitude of compound action potentials (CAP), while both 2 and 3 W/cm 2 intensities decreased CAP amplitudes.
18958151:8	Mihran and colleagues (1990) also reported differential excitatory and inhibitory effects of US on frog sciatic CAPs using relatively short irradiation times by delivering 500 µs US pulses (2.0–7.0 MHz) with peak intensities ranging from 100–800 W/cm 2.
18958151:9	Direct activation of the cat auditory nerve has been achieved in vivo using 5-MHz US pulses (68 µsec; ∼30 W/cm 2) . In human subjects, focused US pulses have been shown to activate deep nerve structures in the hand by differentially producing tactile, thermal, and pain sensations .
18958151:10	Although numerous intriguing studies examining the influence of US on neuronal activity have been conducted, these previous investigations have implemented high-intensity US, which can destroy nervous tissue.
18958151:11	Thus, we decided to investigate the influence of low-intensity ultrasound on neuronal activity.
18958151:12	Most of the prior investigations examining the effect of US on neuronal activity also used high-frequency US (>1 MHz; for exceptions see , ), which has larger attenuation coefficients compared to lower frequency ultrasound.
18958151:13	Medical diagnostic US typically operates from 1 to 15 MHz while therapeutic US is usually conducted using acoustic frequencies around 1 MHz . We chose to pursue our investigations here using low-frequency US (0.44–0.67
18958151:14	MHz) since both mathematical models and experimental data indicate the optimal gain between transcranial transmission and brain absorption for US is ∼0.60–0.70
18958151:15	MHz . Detailed cellular investigations into the influence of US on neuronal activity are lacking and the mechanisms underlying US modulation of neuronal activity remain unknown.
18958151:16	By optically monitoring changes in ionic conductance in individual neurons and synaptic transmission from individual release sites we investigated the influence of low-intensity, low-frequency ultrasound (LILFU) on central nervous system activity.
18958151:17	Results 
Discussion 
In this study we tested whether LILFU was capable of directly stimulating the activity of neurons in the central nervous system.
18958151:18	We made several novel observations in our study.
18958151:19	From a mechanistic view, we observed that US stimulates neuronal activity at least partially by triggering voltage-gated Na + transients and voltage-dependent Ca 2+ transients.
18958151:20	We further observed the US-induced changes in neuronal activity were sufficient to trigger SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptic transmission at central synapses thereby driving network activity.
18958151:21	The mechanisms underlying US activation of voltage-sensitive channels in neurons are presently unknown.
18958151:22	We postulate however the mechanical nature of US and its interactions with neuronal membranes leads to the opening of mechanically sensitive voltage-gated channels.
18958151:23	Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that TTX a voltage-gated Na + channel pore-blocker attenuated LILFU-triggered Na + transients.
18958151:24	Further, many voltage-gated Na + channels (i.e.
18958151:25	NaV 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6) are known to possess varying degrees of mechanical sensitivity . The addition of TTX also blocked a large portion of LILFU-induced Ca 2+ transients indicating the primary action of LILFU may be on voltage-gated Na + channels.
18958151:26	However, the addition of Cd 2+ further reduced LILFU-activated Ca 2+ transients, which suggests at least some voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels may be sensitive to LILFU.
18958151:27	Indeed, L-type, N-type, T-type, and P-type Ca 2+ channels have been shown to be mechanically sensitive under various conditions . 
Further studies are required to identify which ion channels are sensitive to US, as well as to characterize how these channels respond to US as a function of acoustic intensity.
18958151:28	By imaging large fields of view and monitoring the responses from large populations of neurons, we observed that LILFU-1 stimulated activity in ∼30% of the neurons in a given field.
18958151:29	These observations raise several interesting issues.
18958151:30	We question for instance whether neurons, which have been recently active, are less susceptible to US stimulation.
18958151:31	In other words, the kinetic states of a neuron's ion channels may shape how responsive a given cell is to US stimulation.
18958151:32	It could also be the case that recently active neurons are more responsive to US stimulation.
18958151:33	We are currently in the process of investigating these issues.
18958151:34	The individual properties of US waveforms (peak and temporal average intensity, tone burst/pulse duration, pulse repetition frequency, etc.) will also likely determine how effective a given waveform is at stimulating neuronal activity.
18958151:35	With respect to acoustic intensity for example, we observed that US waveforms having moderate intensities were more robust in triggering synaptic transmission compared to US waveforms possessing lower or higher intensities.
18958151:36	Future studies investigating the influence of US on neuronal activity should consider interactions among waveform parameters such as tone-burst duration (pulse length), pulse repetition frequency, exposure time, acoustic frequency, and acoustic intensity.
18958151:37	Understanding how waveform characteristics contribute to the actions of US on neuronal activity will be an important issue to resolve.
18958151:38	One particularly interesting question is can LILFU be used in a molecularly specific manner–perhaps by inducing protein specific resonances using an optimal acoustic frequency or particular LILFU waveform?

Much of the debate about the worth, or otherwise, of clinical follow-up of patients after completion of their local and adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer centres around the possible survival benefits of this approach
19128446:1	The limited data, well reviewed by Collins and coworkers , do not demonstrate any survival advantage for follow-up.
19128446:2	However, those authors identified only five randomized trials addressing follow-up questions, which between them contained 3,116 patients, and so they cannot exclude absolute survival benefits of perhaps 4% or 5% for follow-up strategies.
19128446:3	Death, like birth and taxes, remains inevitable in life, and extension of the duration of life justifies only some of what we do in the treatment of breast cancer.
19128446:4	For patients with early breast cancer that can be treated by breast conservation, there remains no evidence that this approach offers better survival than mastectomy, but few – if any – would argue against offering women breast conservation.
19128446:5	Similarly, more than 6,000 patients were randomized in the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) adjuvant trial , which compared anastrazole with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, but there was not even a hint of a survival advantage at over 5 years of follow-up for the use of anastrazole rather than tamoxifen, but it is a widely accepted as an appropriate treatment.
19128446:6	So, if we do not do clinical follow-up to improve survival, what other advantages might there be, and what do accepted guidelines suggest should be done?
19128446:7	Aiming at a North American audience, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines  state that, 'The evidence supports regular history, physical examination, and mammography as the cornerstone of appropriate breast cancer follow-up.
19128446:8	Examinations should be performed every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, every 6 to 12 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter.
19128446:9	For those who have undergone breast-conserving surgery, a post-treatment mammogram should be obtained 1 year after the initial mammogram and at least 6 months after completion of radiation therapy.
19128446:10	Thereafter, unless otherwise indicated, a yearly mammographic evaluation should be performed.
19128446:11	The use of [lots of tests] is not recommended for routine breast cancer follow-up in an otherwise asymptomatic patient with no specific findings on clinical examination.'
19128446:12	However, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) , presumably reviewing the same data, concluded that, 'Guidelines for limited (two or three years) follow-up should be agreed by each network.
19128446:13	The aims of follow-up should be to detect and treat local recurrence and adverse effects of therapy, particularly lymphoedema.
19128446:14	Intensive follow-up, designed to detect metastatic disease before symptoms develop, is not beneficial and should not be provided.'
19128446:15	The only thing both guidelines seem to agree on is the futility of conducting lots of intensive tests to try to detect asymptomatic metastatic disease.
19128446:16	What data are there to support the NICE-endorsed limitation of follow-up to only 2 or 3 years, and to focus primarily on lymphoedema as the key toxicity?
19128446:17	Data from a retrospective analysis of 1,312 women treated with breast conservation in Edinburgh between 1991 and 1998 suggested that only half of the 'treatable recurrences' were detected mammographically . Furthermore, that same study reported that although the peak incidence of metastatic disease (the one thing that NICE does not think we should be looking for in follow-up clinics) was in the first 2 or 3 years, the risk for local ('treatable') relapse was constant for at least the first 10 years!
19128446:18	It would therefore seem that the NICE guidance is inconsistent with this study and much of the rest of the literature, in the sense that limiting follow-up to the first 2 or 3 years does not appear to maximize the chances of detecting and treating local recurrence, with no data to support this recommendation provided in the paper summarizing the evidence base for the 2002 NICE recommendations!
19128446:19	Several authors have reviewed all of the data relating to follow-up [ - ], but few have commented on one critical fact.
19128446:20	There is no doubt that the survival of women with early breast cancer is improving.
19128446:21	Furthermore, although there is debate as to the relative contributions of screening, better preoperative diagnostics, better local treatments and pathological assessments, and the application of adjuvant therapies, it must be recalled that all of the important studies were based on the assumption that there would be regular and sustained clinical follow-up.
19128446:22	Furthermore, all of the randomized trials that compare alternative methods of follow-up have included some form of clinical follow-up in both arms.
19128446:23	We therefore ignore this consistent factor in all of those trials at our peril, in the absence of any robust data indicating that follow-up is not important in the treatment of our patients!
19128446:24	Thus, the question to be addressed is not really whether there is any evidence to support ceasing clinical follow-up – there is none.
19128446:25	Until such a time that there is a properly powered randomized trial that proves that there is no benefit to patients from being reviewed clinically on a regular basis, we have no evidence to stop doing what most of us, and most of our patients, feel is appropriate – keeping in regular clinical contact.
19128446:26	However, the devil is in the detail, and the debate really must focus around how patients can be followed up, how frequently, for how long and what might be the purpose of any follow-up.
19128446:27	Table summarises the issues.
19128446:28	Follow-up models 
The traditional model is of frequent attendance at busy clinics, usually with a consultant present; the reality, though, is that patients are seen by frequently rotating junior staff.
19128446:29	This is reflected in data indicating that patients attending hospital clinics see a median of 10 different doctors over 5 years of follow-up.
19128446:30	Could this be better delivered in the primary care sector?
19128446:31	One trial randomized 296 patients between follow-up in hospital or by specially trained general practitioners . No difference was found in time to diagnosis of relapse or in quality of life, but the investigators did report that patients being followed up in general practice had more, and longer, visits than those in the secondary care sector, but were more satisfied . A subsequent, larger study yielded similar findings . A further study compared different frequencies of follow-up and found that less frequent follow-up was preferred by the majority of patients . 
Should patients undergo regular mammography as part of their follow-up?
19128446:32	This is the recommendation of the ASCO guidelines but not of the previous NICE guidelines.
19128446:33	The Ontario guidelines recognize that although there are no randomized data to support this approach, there is reasonable level C evidence to support its use to detect both ipsilateral recurrence and contralateral second primary breast cancer . Organizing such regular mammography does not need regular clinic visits but, unless for example it is done within a systematic national breast screening programme, few health care systems are currently in a position to provide this service for breast cancer patients without being based within a clinical structure.
19128446:34	So what sort of follow-up approach does make sense?
19128446:35	Montgomery and coworkers  reviewed the literature available up to 2006 and concluded that, 'There are no randomised trials in the literature with sufficient power to recommend an acceptable frequency or duration of follow up.
19128446:36	Moreover, there are no randomised trials that can confirm the safety of using alternative follow-up methods.'
19128446:37	In essence, they conclude that there is no real evidence for or against any particular follow-up strategy.
19128446:38	The NICE guidelines strongly recommend indefinite access to a breast care nurse and that issues of hormonal drug therapy should be left to general practitioners.
19128446:39	However, one study reported that up to 15% of patients return to hospital-based clinics within a year of discharge , so perhaps this non-clinic-based approach to managing ongoing symptoms is not appropriate for all patients!
19128446:40	There are two studies that reported high levels of patient satisfaction with a structured, prebooked, trained nurse led telephone follow-up, combined with CA125 testing in ovarian cancer  and with mammography in breast cancer . Thus, it may be that future provision of follow-up will involve more use of technology and nurses, although the latter are not necessarily much more economical than involving junior doctors in the clinic!
19128446:41	A further consideration is the possible benefit for the health care provider of follow-up, which will not be measured in most studies.
19128446:42	How can treating clinicians assess the quality of their care, measure medium-term and long-term disease outcome, cosmesis, satisfaction and toxicity of treatment without being able to continue to assess the patients they have treated?
19128446:43	How can those planning health care provision be sure that they are delivering optimal service if the outcomes are unknown?
19128446:44	What opportunity does discharge to untrained general practitioner offer patients and their relatives to discuss the finer details of their treatment, its toxicities, and all of the implications to them and their families of a diagnosis of breast cancer?
19128446:45	Finally, even NICE recognizes the importance of follow-up for research protocols.
19128446:46	At present in the UK, one patient is enrolled to a study in breast cancer for every three or four diagnosed with the disease, and so cessation of regular follow-up for all but those included in trials will have less impact on overall workload than is perhaps anticipated by those health economists who recommend it!
19128446:47	Furthermore, as we move into an era of newer therapies, there may be unexpected rare toxicities that will not be detected in a modestly sized trial population, but only in larger national datasets.
19128446:48	Conclusion 
Our entire current evidence base for treating breast cancer includes regular, sustained follow-up, and there are no data that provide firm support for any particular level or method of follow-up.
19128446:49	Thus, the debate must be about how, where and by whom follow-up should occur, and not about its worthlessness, until such time as a properly powered prospective trial produces evidence to suggest that it is not worth doing from any perspective!

21286025:0	INTRODUCTION 
The proportion of candidemia cases caused by non-albicans Candida species has been increasing.
21286025:1	Some non-albicans Candida species are associated with resistance to the usual antifungal azoles.
21286025:2	C. haemulonii a non-albicans Candida species, does not frequently cause human infections.
21286025:3	Microbiologically, the susceptibility profile of C. haemulonii shows that it is resistant to amphotericin B and other antifungal agents such as azoles, which have often been associated with clinical treatment failure.
21286025:4	No treatment regimen for invasive C. haemulonii infections has been clearly established.
21286025:5	We investigated a catheter-related candidemia infection due to C. haemulonii and report on resolution of the infection using caspofungin, an echinocandin antifungal agent.
21286025:6	CASE DESCRIPTION 
On June 25, 2009, a 67-yr-old man with a cerebral infarction was hospitalized in the department of rehabilitation medicine for physical rehabilitation.
21286025:7	Prior to admission, he experienced cerebral infarction and was hospitalized for two months, beginning in March, 2009.
21286025:8	He had received a tracheostomy at his previous admission.
21286025:9	A physical examination did not reveal any signs of infection, including at the tracheostomy site.
21286025:10	The patient received a right subclavian venous catheter for total parenteral nutrition on the second day of hospitalization because of the risk of aspiration when receiving nasogastric tube feedings.
21286025:11	On August 15 (the 50th day of hospitalization), the patient had a temperature of 37.8℃, a white cell count of 10.4 × 10 9/liter, and a C-reactive protein level of 10.8 mg/liter.
21286025:12	However, the blood culture failed to reveal any infectious organism.
21286025:13	The mild fever continued, and the level of CRP and white cell count continued to increase.
21286025:14	On August 29 (the 64th day of hospitalization), a blood culture collected 72 hr previously showed yeast growth, and the subclavian venous catheter was removed.
21286025:15	Intravenous fluconazole (400 mg once a day) was administered as empirical therapy, pending identification of the yeast.
21286025:16	A qualitative culture of the catheter tip also produced a yeast culture.
21286025:17	The yeast from the blood culture and catheter tip, designated as LYS-1, was identified as Candida sp. on the seventh day of fluconazole therapy.
21286025:18	The physician continued the fluconazole therapy for the candidemia.
21286025:19	The blood cultures performed on the fourth and 14th days of fluconazole therapy were still positive for yeast, and the mild fever persisted.
21286025:20	On September 15 (the 18th day of fluconazole treatment), the infectious disease department was consulted and recommended an echocardiography, a bone scan, an abdominal CT, and Doppler sonography for venous thrombosis.
21286025:21	The echocardiograph revealed no signs of infectious endocarditis.
21286025:22	The bone scan, abdominal CT, and Doppler sonography revealed no significant findings.
21286025:23	On September 17 (the 84th day of hospitalization), the treatment regimen was changed to caspofungin (50 mg daily after a 70 mg loading dose).
21286025:24	The blood culture was sterile on the third and tenth days of caspofungin therapy.
21286025:25	On the second day of the caspofungin treatment, the patient became afebrile and showed clinical improvement.
21286025:26	In resolution, the patient underwent a 17-day course of caspofungin and remained stable after discontinuation of the antifungal agent.
21286025:27	DISCUSSION 
C. haemulonii was originally described from a sample taken from the gut of a blue-striped grunt (Haemulon scirus) in 1962, and Lavarde et al. reported the first clinical isolation of this fungus from a human in 1984.
21286025:28	Several meaningful cases of C. haemulonii candidemia have been reported.
21286025:29	Antifungal resistance is the focus of attention in the management of invasive candidiasis.
21286025:30	In previous cases, most C. haemulonii were resistant to both fluconazole and amphotericin B.
21286025:31	Clinically, when amphotericin B was administered empirically, it failed to eradicate C. haemulonii candidemia.
21286025:32	The majority of cases in which fluconazole was administered empirically also failed to eradicate candidemia.
21286025:33	Although fluconazole administration has been shown to resolve candidemia, these cases could be considered transient candidemia combined with the removal of the intravenous catheter.
21286025:34	Therefore, the resistance of C. haemulonii poses a therapeutic challenge for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
21286025:35	Microbiologically, previous reports and our case show that C. haemulonii is susceptible to echinocandins such as caspofungin or micafungin ( , ), and that it was not resistant to new triazoles such as voriconazole.
21286025:36	However, it is not certain that echinocandins or voriconazole are actually efficacious in the treatment of C. haemulonii candidemia.
21286025:37	There have been only two cases of clinical success in the eradication of C. haemulonii candidemia via echinocandins administration.
21286025:38	One case used micafungin, and the other used caspofungin.
21286025:39	Of those, in the treatment with caspofungin of a neonate, echinocandin was combined with amphotericin B.
21286025:40	Therefore, our case could demonstrate clinical success with caspofungin administration in the eradication of C. haemulonii candidemia in an adult patient.
21286025:41	In our case, the VITEK II (bioMérieux SA) clinical yeast identification system was used for initial identification of C. haemulonii and sequence analysis of the partial 26s rRNA gene (519 bp) was performed for confirmation.
21286025:42	The 519-bp sequences of the isolate matched completely with the corresponding sequences of the reference strain, C. haemulonii strain TJY2d, available in the GenBank database (accession number EU359820).
21286025:43	In recent studies, the identification results of the VITEK 2 system have closely corresponded with those of molecular methods for the identification of C. haemulonii while the VITEK 1 system and the API 32C system usually fail to identify C. haemulonii.
21286025:44	Known risk factors for candidemia are use of central-venous catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, previous multiple antibiotics, previous steroid therapy, previous abdominal surgery, and an immunocompromised status.
21286025:45	In our case, long-term central-venous catheterization for hyperalimentation was the associated risk factor for candidemia, and no other source of infection suggested the possibility of catheter-related candidemia.
21286025:46	In previous case reports, the majority of patients also received an intravenous central line and were in an immunocompromised status.
21286025:47	Considering the recent case series of invasive C. haemulonii infections, C. haemulonii is considered to be an emerging yeast pathogen for which the optimal strategy of patient management has yet to be elucidated.
21286025:48	In conclusion, as found in the previous case reports, fluconazole and amphotericin B are not reliable empirical antifungal agents for the treatment of C. haemulonii candidemia.
21286025:49	Echinocandins, such as caspofungin or micafungin, may be an appropriate empirical choice of antifungal agent for invasive C. haemulonii infections.
21286025:50	New triazoles require additional clinical testing for treatment of C. haemulonii infection.
18301760:0	Introduction 
As de Solla Price observed the number of scientific journals and the number of papers published in those journals is increasing at an approximately exponential rate.
18301760:1	The size and growth of the research literature places a tremendous burden on researchers—how are they to select what to browse, what to read, and what to cite from a large and quickly growing body of literature?
18301760:2	This burden does not only affect researchers.
18301760:3	Funding agencies, university administrators, and reviewers are called on to evaluate the productivity of researchers and institutions, as well as the impact of their work.
18301760:4	Typically, these agents have neither the time nor the financial resources to obtain an in-depth evaluation of the actual research and must instead use indirect indicators of quality such as number of publications, h -index, number of citations, or journal rank – . 
Despite the oversimplification of using just a few numbers to quantify the scientific merit of a body of research, the entire science and technology community is relying more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research quality of individuals and institutions .
18301760:5	An example of this trend is the widespread use of the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Journal Impact Factor (JIF) to rate scientific journals.
18301760:6	This practice is pervasive enough that, despite evidence that the JIF can be misleading , some countries pay researchers per paper published with the amount being determined by the JIF of the journal in which the paper is published .
18301760:7	This act of “judging a book by its cover” has caused researchers to note that we should judge a paper not by the number of citations that the journal in which it is published receives, but by the number of citations the paper itself receives .
18301760:8	This seemingly obvious fact is countered by one major challenge—administrators often want an estimate of the impact of a paper long before it has finished accumulating citations, which, as we show later, might take as long as 26 years.
18301760:9	The need for an estimate of the ultimate impact of recently published articles is the reason that the JIF is often used as a proxy for quality of the research.
18301760:10	Indeed, the premise of the peer-reviewing process is that reviewers are in fact able to assess the quality of a paper.
18301760:11	Thus, the heuristic that the journal in which a paper is published is a good proxy for the ultimate impact of a paper is likely to be an adaptive one .
18301760:12	Like any heuristic, the evaluation of research using citation analysis has weaknesses.
18301760:13	These weaknesses have been extensively explored in the literature , however, as reviewed by Nicolaisen there are plausible assumptions underlying the use of citation analysis as a heuristic.
18301760:14	Here, we assume that the quality of a paper bears significant correlation with the ultimate impact of the paper, that is, the asymptotic total number of citations to that paper.
18301760:15	We further assume that the actual relation between total number of citations and quality is uncertain, and may be field- and even journal-dependent.
18301760:16	This latter assumption is prompted by the observation that many extrinsic factors for which we have no data can influence the number of citations that the paper receives.
18301760:17	For example, because social influence may affect the citations to a paper, small differences in quality may lead to large differences in the number of citations . 
In this article, we investigate two fundamental aspects concerning the prediction of the ultimate impact of a published research paper: (i) the time scale τ for the full impact of papers published in a given journal to become apparent, and (ii) the typical impact of papers published in a given journal.
18301760:18	We find that τ varies from less than 1 year to 26 years, depending on the journal.
18301760:19	Additionally, we find that there is a typical value and a well-defined range for the eventual impact of papers published in a given journal, which enables us to develop a model for the distribution of paper impacts that matches the data.
18301760:20	These findings lead us to propose a method of ranking journals based on a natural criterion: the higher a journal is ranked, the higher the probability of finding a high impact paper published in that journal.
18301760:21	Results 
We obtained the number of citations accrued by December 31, 2006 for 22,951,535 papers tracked in Thomson Scientific's Web of Science® (WoS) database.
18301760:22	This database comprises information on papers published in ∼5,800 science and engineering journals, ∼1,700 social science journals, and ∼1,100 arts and humanities journals.
18301760:23	Journals are typically covered from their inception or from the beginning of the WoS coverage for the research area (whichever is later) until the present date or until their demise (whichever is earlier).
18301760:24	The beginning of WoS coverage for science and engineering, social science, and arts and humanities is 1955, 1956, and 1975 respectively.
18301760:25	In this study, we restrict our analysis to journals publishing at least 50 articles per year for at least 15 years.
18301760:26	This condition restricts our analysis to 19,372,228 articles published in 2,267 journals, and enables us to ensure good statistics on the journals that we include in the analysis.
18301760:27	More information about the data is included in . 
Because the citation history of a paper may be field- and even journal-dependent, we first investigate the probability distribution of ℓ the logarithm of the number of citations accrued by each paper by December 31st of 2006, for articles published in journal J during year Y . We define ℓ as where n is the number of accrued citations.
18301760:28	display estimates of the probability density function for the Journal of Biological Chemistry for different years.
18301760:29	Two patterns are apparent from the data.
18301760:30	First, the distribution for each of the years considered shows a tendency to peak around a central value, that is, there is a characteristic value for ℓ . Second, after about 10 years, the distribution has converged to a steady-state functional form, . The explanation for this apparently counter-intuitive observation is that papers with a small number of citations have stopped accruing citations, while the trickle of citations to the most highly-cited papers is small when compared to the already accrued citations, and thus does not significantly change the value of the logarithm of the number of citations.
18301760:31	These results are not restricted to the Journal of Biological Chemistry ; displays these two characteristics for nearly all journals we analyzed (see ).
18301760:32	However, as illustrated in the mean value of ℓ in the steady state, and the time τ ( J ) needed to reach the steady state depend on the journal—for example, τ ( Astrophysical Journal ) is more than twice τ ( Circulation ), yet .
18301760:33	The existence of a steady state for prompts us to investigate: (i) the functional form of and (ii) whether there is a universal functional form for all journals.
18301760:34	As others have noted many papers remain uncited even decades after their publication.
18301760:35	For those papers that do get cited, the total number of citations varies over five orders of magnitude (the most highly-cited paper in the data had received 196,452 citations by the end of 2006).
18301760:36	Nevertheless, ℓ follows a distribution that is approximately normal.
18301760:37	In order to explain our empirical findings, we develop a model for the asymptotic number of citations a paper published in journal J will receive.
18301760:38	Our first assumption is that the papers published in journal J have a normal distribution of “quality”, q ∈ N ( μ σ ), where μ and σ depend on J . The simplest model is to equate the ultimate impact with quality, ℓ ≈ q so that n ≈10 q.
18301760:39	However, since 10 q is a continuous random variable, whereas n is integer-valued, the model needs further refinement.
18301760:40	In particular, the model must also specify how the continuous values of q map onto the discrete values of n . For generality, we introduce an additional parameter γ to the model, such that 
One can interpret γ as the value of q at which one can expect a paper to get cited once.
18301760:41	More generally, one could write n  = floor(10 q+ε− γ ), where ε ∈ N (0, σ ε), to account for external influences to the number of citations.
18301760:42	For example, assuming γ  = 0 and q  = 3, one would get n  = 794 for ε  = −0.1 and n  = 1258 for ε  = 0.1.
18301760:43	However, if ε is independent of J will not be significantly affected by ε . Thus, even though the number of citations to individual papers may change, the mean for a journal will not.
18301760:44	To demonstrate the agreement between our model and the data, in we plot the moments of the empirical distributions for each journal together with the predictions of our model for those quantities.
18301760:45	It is visually apparent that the model provides a close description of the data.
18301760:46	Discussion 
Our finding that the distribution of number of citations is log-normal is in agreement with recent generative models of the citation network that predict a log-normal distribution for subsets of papers related by content similarity.
18301760:47	Note that this result is not in disagreement with prior claims about the power-law behavior of the citation distribution as the convolution of many log-normal distributions with different means can yield a distribution that can be hard to distinguish from a power law.
18301760:48	The findings reported in and demonstrate that there is a quantity, related to the ultimate impact of a paper, which for papers published in a given journal is normally distributed.
18301760:49	For all papers published in journal J that quantity has a well-defined mean, q̅ ( J ) =  μ implying that the average q of the papers is representative of the q of all the papers published in the journal and, thus, of the q of the journal.
18301760:50	Our findings thus suggest the possibility of ranking journals according to q̅ ( J ).
18301760:51	To this end, we turn to a heuristic used in information retrieval called the Probability Ranking Principle . This principle dictates that the optimal ranking of a set of journals will be the one that maximizes the probability that given a pair of papers ( a,b ) from journals A and B, respectively, q ( a )> q ( b ) if A is above B in that ranking.
18301760:52	This probability is also known as the multi-class “area under curve” (AUC) statistic – (see and for details).
18301760:53	We rank journals in different fields according to both q̅ ( J ) and the JIF.
18301760:54	illustrates the effectiveness of these two ranking schemes for separating papers into different journals based on their impact.
18301760:55	In we provide rankings and the value of the multi-class AUC statistic for all fields.
18301760:56	Our analysis demonstrates that the ranking scheme defined by q̅ ( J ) is very similar to the optimal ranking.
18301760:57	Our analysis also demonstrates that the mean number of citations and the JIF provide particularly inaccurate ranking schemes.
18301760:58	This finding is particularly important because some journals and some fields benefit greatly in reputation from the biases in the JIF, while others are at a disadvantage (see and and ).
18301760:59	The bias introduced by the JIF arises directly from the major methodological problems raised against using citation analysis to evaluate journals.
18301760:60	First, the mean number of citations to papers published in a journal is not representative of the number of citations to each individual paper a point that our analysis systematically confirms.
18301760:61	However, we show that q̅ ( J ) is representative of the q of the papers published in journal J that being the reason why ranking according to q̅ ( J ) is efficient.
18301760:62	Second, citation behavior varies by field . Our analysis again confirms this.
18301760:63	Nevertheless, we show that by comparing the steady-state behavior of a set of journals and keeping comparisons to within fields, one can accurately rank a set of journals.
18301760:64	Our findings provide a quantitative measure of the efficacy of academic journals, through the work of editors and reviewers, at organizing research based on their prediction of the ultimate impact of that research.
18301760:65	Even though far from perfect, the journal system and the ranking of journals provides a powerful heuristic with which to locate the research that will ultimately have the largest impact.

17623083:0	Background 
Chloroplasts are derived from an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium that invaded the eukaryotic cell a billion years ago.
17623083:1	During the evolutionary process from endosymbiont to contemporary organelles, the cyanobacterium lost the bulk of its genome and retained the genes encoding the photosynthesis machinery and the components of several chemical pathways.
17623083:2	During this process, it also acquired many host-derived properties and was thus transformed into a distinct organelle: the chloroplast.
17623083:3	Angiosperm chloroplast genomes present a similar gene content and gene order.
17623083:4	They are circular molecules that can also be present in linear forms with multiple copies, ranging in size from 120 kb to 160 kb, but usually around 150 kb with about 90–110 unique genes . A pair of large inverted repeats (IR) about 21–28 kb in length divides the genome into one large single-copy region (LSC) and one small single-copy region (SSC).
17623083:5	rRNA genes are always located in IR regions.
17623083:6	Despite the overall conservation of plastomes, genomic diversification was also experienced in many respects.
17623083:7	Many genes were lost phylogenetically, independently in parallel or uniquely lost in a particular species .
17623083:8	An extreme example is the cpDNA of the parasite plant Epifagus virginiana which lost 13 tRNA genes and retained only 60 genes so that the genome was reduced to 70 kb .
17623083:9	It was found that several kinds of inversions interrupted the gene order of the plastome [ - ].
17623083:10	They are generally associated with specific lineages and thus could be a sign of important events in evolutionary diversification . 
Sequence duplication is another feature of some land plant chloroplast genomes.
17623083:11	For example, Pelargonium × hortorum contains some large duplicated fragments, including several genes, and numerous simple repeats as well as a tremendous extension of IR (75 kb) . Definite evidence supporting transposition within plastid genomes is lacking, but intramolecular recombination mediated by short direct repeats has been reported .
17623083:12	The chloroplast genes have been extensively used to study the phylogenetic relationships at several taxonomic levels, especially in the analysis of basal clades, mainly because they have slower mutation rate in comparison with the nuclear genes . The Fabaceae (legume) family is one of the largest and more diverse angiosperm families.
17623083:13	It comprises about 20,000 species, which are distributed essentially in tropical regions.
17623083:14	Chloroplast-derived markers have been used to study the evolutionary relationship between some legume plants (Fabaceae) [ - ].
17623083:15	However, to date, only the sequences of three legume chloroplast genomes have been reported: Lotus japonicus Glycine max  and Medicago truncatula ( unpublished).
17623083:16	The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris is a major food crop, domesticated independently in two sites: Mesoamerica and South America.
17623083:17	The physical map of its chloroplast genome was published in 1983  and some small pieces of the chloroplast genome were sequenced to study domestication  and phylogeny issues.
17623083:18	Here we report the chloroplast sequence of P . vulgaris cv.
17623083:19	Negro Jamapa.
17623083:20	A comparative analysis of this sequence with other legume chloroplast genomes indicates that these genomes are highly diversified in sequence and organization.
17623083:21	Moreover, we provide evidence that one plastome ( P . vulgaris ) evolved faster than another ( G. max ) at the genomic and gene levels, which could be the consequence of pressure coming from both mutation and natural selection.
17623083:22	Results 
Discussion 
Conclusion 
Plastomes of leguminous plants have evolved specific genomic structures.
17623083:23	They have undergone diversification in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and evolutionary rates.
18940003:0	Background 
Sequence-based pathogen identification is an increasingly important tool for clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring of biological threat agents.
18940003:1	Developments in sequencing technology have led to the availability of many pathogen genome sequences.
18940003:2	Many more pathogen genomes and near-neighbors are being sequenced due to initiatives by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the U.S. Department of Defense.
18940003:3	Availability of these genomic sequences has opened up opportunities for the development of whole-genome-based diagnostic assays, such as DNA microarrays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, which offer more flexibility than traditional methods based on a single gene or selected regions of a target genome . Microarray-based pathogen diagnostic assays are gaining popularity due to their ability to test for hundreds, or even thousands, of pathogens in a single diagnostic test . 
Oligonucleotide probes designed for pathogen diagnostic assays should be unique to the pathogen with respect to all other non-target genomes.
18940003:4	Clinical and environmental samples may contain a multitude of non-target genomes, and hence probes designed for diagnostic assays must be unique with respect to all non-target genomes.
18940003:5	As a result, the design of pathogen diagnostic assays entails the computationally expensive comparison of target genomes with all known non-target sequences.
18940003:6	Many different methods have been developed to guide the design of pathogen diagnostic assays.
18940003:7	Some methods [ - ] are intended for PCR-based assays, whereas others [ - ] are intended for microarray-based assays.
18940003:8	Kaderali and Schliep  presented one of the first methods for designing microarrays for pathogen identification.
18940003:9	Their approach is very similar to that of designing probes for gene expression analysis; they design a single probe for each target, with the probe being unique to the target with respect to all other input target sequences.
18940003:10	However, the specificity of the probe with respect to other non-target genomes is not analyzed.
18940003:11	A somewhat similar approach is that of host-blind probe design presented by Putonti et al . , in which the probes are unique only with respect to a host genome.
18940003:12	With a few exceptions, however, most of these tools do not have the capability of testing for specificity against a large number of non-target genomes.
18940003:13	This is clearly not adequate if the signatures are to be used to identify the pathogen from environmental/clinical samples containing any number of unanticipated non-target organisms.
18940003:14	Some tools for designing PCR assays, such as KPATH  and Insignia , perform in silico comparisons against all known non-target sequences.
18940003:15	They also have the ability to design common signatures for multiple pathogen sequences.
18940003:16	In KPATH, common PCR signatures are selected from a multiple sequence alignment of the target genomes.
18940003:17	As described by Fitch et al . , this approach is inherently based on the assumption of collinearity within the target genomes, which may not hold true for bacterial genomes.
18940003:18	Insignia, on the other hand, selects common signatures from shared sequences discovered through pairwise local alignments and, hence, does not assume collinearity.
18940003:19	Neither KPATH nor Insignia is applicable for designing microarray fingerprints, as the design and specificity requirements of microarray fingerprints are quite different from those of PCR signatures.
18940003:20	The most commonly used PCR signatures consist of a probe and two primers and, due to their short length [18–25 base pairs (bp)] and constraints on the interprimer distance, inexact matches with non-target sequences can be tolerated without much degradation in specificity.
18940003:21	Conversely, in addition to being characterized by only one DNA segment with no spacing constraints, microarray probes are generally longer and more susceptible to cross hybridization even in the absence of an exact match .
18940003:22	This requires more extensive searches, for both exact and inexact matches, against non-target sequences to identify highly specific fingerprints for microarrays.
18940003:23	We have previously developed a software tool  for designing microarray probes that identify fingerprints for a single target genome.
18940003:24	The software, named TOFI (Tool for Oligonucleotide Fingerprint Identification), is an integrated, scalable, high-performance-computing pipeline, which combines genome comparison tools, probe design software, and sequence alignment programs to design highly specific microarray probes for pathogen identification.
18940003:25	To our knowledge, TOFI is the only software that has the ability to design microarray probes that are specific to the target with respect to all sequenced non-target genomes.
18940003:26	In this paper, we extend the TOFI pipeline to design microarray probes for multiple, related, bacterial and viral pathogens.
18940003:27	Our aim is to efficiently identify all probes in the input target sequences that are unique with respect to all available non-target sequences.
18940003:28	The major contributions of this paper include: (1) an efficient algorithm that pre-processes the input target sequences to take advantage of the similarities among them and reduce their effective size, which results in considerable speedup (nearly four-fold for eight targets and greater for larger numbers) when compared to the previous, single-target version of the pipeline, (2) a novel three-state hybridization matrix computation strategy, which identifies probes that can be used to characterize the possible combinations of the input target genomes, and (3) a set of experimental results with multiple Burkholderia genomes, which allow us to validate the new algorithms and the specificity criteria that were recently introduced (but not experimentally validated) in .
18940003:29	The improved pipeline scales well with increase in the number of target genomes, and can potentially design fingerprints for hundreds of related target genomes in a single run.
18940003:30	Methods 
In the following, we briefly describe the TOFI pipeline for a single genome, and then present the algorithmic improvements implemented to accommodate multiple genomes.
18940003:31	The TOFI pipeline consists of the three main stages illustrated in Figure . The stages are designed so that large portions of the target genome are eliminated in the less-expensive two initial stages, and the computationally more expensive searches for specific fingerprints are performed over smaller regions of the target genome in the final stage.
18940003:32	The reader should refer to  for a detailed description of the TOFI pipeline.
18940003:33	Results 
In this section, we present the results for the identification of in silico fingerprints (i.e., probe design) and their associated experimental evaluation.
18940003:34	For the probe design process, we used probe length parameters L min = 35 and L max = 40, and optimal melting temperature of 70°C.
18940003:35	Probe lengths of 35–40 bases were chosen to ensure compatibility of the probe sequences with microarrays available from various vendors, some of which are limited to the in situ synthesis of probes that are 40 bases or less.
18940003:36	We used the entire NCBI nt database to estimate probe specificity.
18940003:37	Conclusion 
The enhanced TOFI pipeline can efficiently design microarray fingerprints for multiple, related bacterial and viral genomes.
18940003:38	We designed probes for eight pathogenic Burkholderia genomes, covering probes unique to single targets as well as probes common to groups of targets.
18940003:39	Probe design results show that the presented method is effective in taking advantage of the commonalities among the genomes to considerably reduce the overall computation time (about a four-fold reduction in this case, with larger gains for larger number of input targets).
18940003:40	This indicates that the pipeline can be used to design fingerprints for a large number of related microbial genomes in a single run.
18940003:41	In addition, the computational efficiency of the pipeline allows quick reevaluation of the probes as new target/non-target sequences become available.
18940003:42	This study also allowed us to assess and experimentally validate new specificity criteria recently introduced by Vijaya Satya et al. . Preliminary hybridization results, with three targets, one unsequenced target, and one non-target, demonstrate that only a small percentage of the designed probes (≤10%) cross hybridize with non-targets (last three rows of Class B in Table ).
18940003:43	However, additional tests with a larger panel of non-target genomes are necessary to qualify the selected probes for diagnostic assays.
18940003:44	More than 65% of the group-specific probes identify the unsequenced B. pseudomallei 238 strain, which suggests that these probes might be useful in identifying new strains of B. mallei or B.

21614194:0	Introduction 
Rhamnolipids (RLs) are glycolipid biosurfactants produced by various bacterial species including some Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp. . The structure of RLs is highly diverse and those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been extensively studied.
21614194:1	These RLs are amphiphilic molecules typically composed of 3-hydroxyfatty acids linked through a beta-glycosidic bond to mono- or di-rhamnoses . RLs have several potential functions in bacteria.
21614194:2	They are involved in the uptake and biodegradation of poorly soluble substrates and are essential for surface motility and biofilm development .
21614194:3	From a biotechnological point of view, RLs are powerful biosurfactants with applications related to environmental concerns, such as bioremediation of hydrocarbon, organic pollutants and heavy-metal-contaminated sites.
21614194:4	These topics have been extensively reviewed including some very recent articles  . RLs have also been used in the production of fine chemicals, surface coatings, as well as additives for food and cosmetics .
21614194:5	Finally, a new role for RLs as potential players in the combat of plants and animals against microbes has recently emerged.
21614194:6	For years RLs have been extensively studied regarding their direct toxicity to microorganisms but recently they have also been reported to be involved in the stimulation of plant and animal defense responses.
21614194:7	The present review provides an update of the current knowledge on the antimicrobial properties of RLs and also highlights the recent discoveries of the involvement of these molecules in the stimulation of immunity in plants and animals.
21614194:8	The potential use of these molecules to fight against pathogenic microorganisms in medical and agricultural field will be discussed.
21614194:9	Rhamnolipids as Antimicrobial Agents 
RLs have been shown to display antibacterial activities against plant and human pathogenic bacteria.
21614194:10	RLs are known to be active against the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa Enterobacter aerogenes Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumonia as well as against Gram-positive Micrococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus sp  . RLs have direct impact on bacterial cell surface structures.
21614194:11	Al-Tahhan et al .  observed a loss of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in P. aeruginosa strains treated with RLs at low concentrations and this resulted in increased cell surface hydrophobicity.
21614194:12	Recently, Sotirova et al .  showed that RLs from Pseudomonas sp.
21614194:13	PS-17 interact with P. aeruginosa causing a reduction in LPS content and changes in the outer membrane proteins of the bacteria.
21614194:14	These changes had a direct impact on bacterial cell surface morphology.
21614194:15	Sotirova et al .  concluded that RLs from Pseudomonas sp.
21614194:16	PS-17 have a potential application in the field of biomedicine against pathogenic bacteria.
21614194:17	Several studies described antifungal activity of RLs mainly against phytopathogens including Botrytis sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Pythium sp., Phytophtora sp. and Plasmopara sp.  . Additionally, RLs were also shown to be active against Mucor miehei and Neurospora crassa . The main mode of action of RLs against zoospore-producing plant pathogens is the direct lysis of zoospores via the intercalation of RLs within plasma membranes of the zoospore which are not protected by a cell wall [ , ].
21614194:18	Recent studies also demonstrated an effect of RLs in the reduction of mycelia growth of Pythium myriotylum  and Botrytis cinerea . These data suggest that RLs may also have an adverse effect on cell structures that are protected by a cell wall.
21614194:19	Properties of RLs against the algae Heterosigma akashiwo viruses, amoeba like Dictyostelium discoideum and mycoplasma have also been reported  .
21614194:20	However, RLs’ applications have no significant effects on yeasts [ , ].
21614194:21	In addition to their in vitro antimicrobial activity, RLs have proven to be also efficient in in vivo plant systems.
21614194:22	Treatments with RLs have been shown to protect pepper plants from Phytophthora blight disease and also prevent the development of Colletotrichum orbiculare infection on leaves of cucumber plants . Yoo et al .  investigated RLs as alternative antifungal agents against typical plant pathogenic oomycetes, including Phytophthora sp. and Pythium sp.
21614194:23	They showed that RLs significantly decrease the incidence of water-borne damping-off disease.
21614194:24	Sharma et al .  obtained similar results in field trials on chili pepper and tomato.
21614194:25	Using bacterial mutants, Perneel et al .  clearly showed that phenazine and RLs interact in the biological control of soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp.
21614194:26	Recent studies also demonstrated that a combination mixture of SRE (Syringomycin E) and RLs is efficient against pathogenic and opportunistic fungi recovered from diseased grape . 
Rhamnolipids in Plant and Animal Immunity 
During the last decade, pattern recognition emerged as a fundamental process in the immune response of plants and animals.
21614194:27	Perception by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of molecular signatures that identify whole classes of microbes but are absent from the host allows this nonself recognition . Once recognized, these molecular signatures, conventionally named microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) , trigger complex signaling pathways leading to transcriptional activation of defense-related genes and accumulation of antimicrobial metabolites in plant cells . In mammals, MAMP perception leads to the inflammatory response with the production of cytokines including interleukins and the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα).
21614194:28	Years ago, lipopeptides were shown to stimulate human innate immune responses through the PRR Toll-like receptor TLR2 perception, by activating the transcriptional activator of multiple host defense genes NFkB, the production of interleukin (IL)-12 and the respiratory burst  . Lipopeptides are also involved in the stimulation of innate immunity in plants .
21614194:29	It is quite recent that RLs have been shown to be involved in triggering plant and animal defense responses and can be described as a new class of MAMPs.
21614194:30	Potential Use of Rhamnolipids in Agricultural and Biomedical Fields 
Major breakthroughs allowing production, separation and purification of RLs in industrial quantities and laboratory purities have allowed the application of these molecules in different fields from cosmetic to industrial and more recently from agriculture to medicine.
21614194:31	As previously stated, the major advantage of using RL biosurfactants, which have diverse roles in plant and animal systems, is that they are natural and organic biodegradable compounds, originating from a large number of bacteria . RLs have also been proposed to be used in food industry applications . RLs have a direct biocide action on bacteria and fungi.
21614194:32	They also increase the susceptibility of certain Gram-positive bacteria to specific antibiotics.
21614194:33	RLs have been demonstrated to control zoosporic pathogens through lysis of their zoospores . Clinical trials using RLs for the treatment of psoriasis, lichen planus, neurodermatitis and human burn wound healing have confirmed excellent ameliorative effects of RLs when compared to conventional therapy using corticosteroids . RLs also display differential effects on human keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures . The advantages of these biosurfactants are low irritancy and even anti-irritating effects, as well as compatibility with human skin . Moreover, RLs have permeabilizing effects on Gram-positive and Gram-negative human bacterial strains, reinforcing their potential in biomedicine .
21614194:34	An important issue to be taken into account is the study of side effects of biosurfactants on plants and animals.
21614194:35	Attention should be paid while using surfactants on plants as the latter could be affected in many different ways.
21614194:36	Parameters like negative impact on crop yield or other important agronomical traits should not be neglected and should be studied in parallel to avoid any impact on plant growth or metabolism, while boosting plant immunity.
21614194:37	For instance, it is known that high concentrations of RLs cause necrosis in plants . Dose/response experiments in the field are a necessity in order to ensure use of non-toxic concentrations of RLs.
21614194:38	In addition, in animal systems, RLs are known as virulence factors especially for immunocompromised patients and individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) .
21614194:39	At some concentrations, RLs also have hemolytic activity . Thus, care should be taken in the use of RLs, albeit some applications such as fungicide and bactericide are already considered especially for skin treatments . 
Conclusion 
RLs are new actors in animal and plant defense and their low toxicity and biodegradability make them promising molecules to be used against pathogens.
21614194:40	In this respect, there are some clues now available for the success of RL applications in greenhouses to fight phytopathogens.
21614194:41	A better understanding of RL mode of action, especially their perception and the signaling pathways activated, will be very important to potentiate their beneficial effects in plants.
21614194:42	RLs have a dual mode of action: they are antimicrobial and also stimulate plant defense responses.
21614194:43	This dual property is probably very important for the efficiency of new biopesticides.
21614194:44	In animals, the use of RLs is also at an advanced stage.
21614194:45	RLs are successfully used as antimicrobial agents, especially for skin disease treatment.
21614194:46	Deep insight into the physiochemical effects of RLs and their biological importance would reveal new dimensions in the fields of research like agriculture and medicine, precisely in plant defense, disease control and pathogenesis.
21614194:47	An understanding of bacterial genera producing RLs that are not yet well studied would provide light on these fascinating aspects.
18437001:0	INTRODUCTION 
Approximately 400,000 deaths are attributed annually to cigarette smoking, which represent one-fifth of all deaths, and lung cancer and ischemic heart disease have been reported to be responsible for approximately half of smoking-attributable deaths in the U.S. In Korea, smoking cessation has also become an important social issue because lung cancer has been reported to be the most rapidly increasing cause of death.
18437001:1	However, the smoking rate of Korean men remained higher as 69.9% until 2001, compared with 71.2% in 1985.
18437001:2	Tobacco dependence (TD) is an important barrier to smoking cessation because it creates the feeling an urgent need to smoke to avoid the withdrawal symptoms associated with dependence.
18437001:3	Smokers with TD try to stop smoking more often than nondependent smokers but remain more likely to do more trials to quit smoking.
18437001:4	The rate of dependence among ever-users of a drug indicates the risk of developing dependence once an individual has been exposed to the drug.
18437001:5	However, the proportion of smokers who has TD remains controversial.
18437001:6	The earliest study on TD revealed that more than 90% of smokers are dependent, but recent studies suggest a significant proportion of smokers may not be dependent.
18437001:7	The findings of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) by Breslau et al. found that the prevalence of dependence among those who had smoked daily for a month or more at one time was 49.5%, and that the prevalence of lifetime nicotine dependence was 24.1%, which means that about 50% of ever-smokers develop lifetime dependence.
18437001:8	However, no previous study has been conducted to determine current or 12-month dependence among ever-smokers, as mentioned by Hughes et al., which is a measure of the risk of developing dependence after one has been exposed to tobacco smoke.
18437001:9	Thus, it would be informative to determine whether rates of TD among ever-smokers vary or are stationary.
18437001:10	This could be achieved by performing longitudinal comparisons of the rates of current TD among ever-smokers, and the prevalence of ever-smokers and current TD.
18437001:11	If rates of current TD among ever-smokers are changeable, attempts should be made to identify the factors that reduce the rate of dependence.
18437001:12	Alternatively, if rates are stationary, plans should be directed toward preventing initial exposure.
18437001:13	The purpose of this study was to examine whether changes in the rates of 12-month TD have occurred among ever-smokers, and to investigate the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidity.
18437001:14	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
This is the first study to examine the prevalence of 12-month TD among ever-smokers in the general population.
18437001:15	We also compared the prevalence in 1984 and 2001 in order to evaluate changes over the 17-yr period.
18437001:16	Two major findings emerged from this study.
18437001:17	First, 12-month TD was found in about 50% of ever-smokers, and gender differences between the rates of 12-month TD that was observed in 1984 disappeared in 2001.
18437001:18	Second, subjects with 12-month TD showed a higher comorbidity with alcohol dependence.
18437001:19	Between 1984 and 2001, the prevalence of ever-smokers significantly increased in South Korea from 62.6% to 71.9% in men.
18437001:20	However, the rates of 12-month TD to ever-smokers remained consistent at 50%.
18437001:21	Previous studies showed that the prevalence of ever-smokers who had smoked daily for more than one month at some time was estimated as 49.5% by the NCS, and as 39.1% in young adults living in Detroit.
18437001:22	On the other hand, the lifetime prevalence of TD was estimated to be 24.1% in the NCS, and 20.0% in the young adults in Detroit; nearly 50% of those who had ever smoked daily for a month or more.
18437001:23	Although the prevalence of those with 12-month TD and ever-smokers were different in these studies, rates between the two were similar for these three previous studies and for the present study.
18437001:24	Dependence rates among drug ever-users indicate the risk of developing dependence after drug exposure.
18437001:25	The results of this study indicate that tobacco use is associated with strong dependence.
18437001:26	Anthony et al. investigated drug dependence rates among ever-users by age group, and reported than tobacco showed the highest level of dependency, which was found in a study that included alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, stimulants, anxiolytics, analgesics, psychedelics, heroin, and inhalants; the dependence rate ranged from 3.7% for inhalants to 23.1% for heroin.
18437001:27	Gender differences between the rates of 12-month TD among ever-smokers that were observed in 1984 disappeared in 2001.
18437001:28	The rate of 12-month TD among of female ever-smokers was about 50% in 2001, which was similar to those of male ever-smokers both in 1984 and 2001.
18437001:29	A previous study conducted in the young adults in Detroit showed that the rate of TD among ever-smokers was about 50% and no gender difference was found in TD.
18437001:30	The result implies that the susceptibility for TD is currently equal to both genders in Korea as in Western countries.
18437001:31	Moreover, TD was found to be closely associated with alcohol dependence, which concurs with previous studies ( - ).
18437001:32	Some evidence indicates shared genetic influences concerning the development of tobacco and alcohol dependence, and of shared physiological effects, cross-tolerances, or cueing.
18437001:33	With regard to physiological effects, alcohol users may smoke to decrease some of the negative effects from alcohol.
18437001:34	Alcohol dependence is another major health problem in Korea, with a report that the lifetime prevalence was estimated as 8.8%.
18437001:35	Significant associations have been found between TD and alcohol use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders ( - ).
18437001:36	Mood disorders are commonly found among Korean adults.
18437001:37	It is noticeable in this study that TD was also significantly associated with other psychiatric disorders including alcohol abuse, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders in 1984 but not in 2001.
18437001:38	This is mainly attributable to the exclusion criteria of the DSM-IV, where symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance.
18437001:39	We consider that it may be difficult to decide whether depression or anxiety results from tobacco use because subjects are more likely to agree that symptoms stem from TD rather than a psychiatric illness.
18437001:40	Although the results of the present study showed that the rates of TD among ever-smokers are consistent, our study had some important limitations.
18437001:41	The first concerns the retrospective nature of the data used, as recall bias might have affected the accuracies of prevalence and illness duration data.
18437001:42	Second, non-response might also have impacted the results, as it has been reported that non-respondents have higher rates of mental disorders than respondents.
18437001:43	Third, TD was diagnosed with structured interviews by trained interviewers, not with clinical interviews by psychiatrists.
18437001:44	There also are limitations on the diagnostic accuracy of TD.
18437001:45	Lastly, cohort effects might have influenced the results.
18437001:46	Although age and gender rates were similar between the 1984 and 2001 survey, they were different cohorts.
18437001:47	In conclusion, 12-month TD was found to be consistently experienced by 50% of ever-smokers, and those with dependence showed higher comorbidity with alcohol dependence.
18437001:48	TD is a clear barrier to smoking cessation, and continued smoking increases mortality and morbidity.
18437001:49	Further research is needed to diagnose vulnerable groups before exposure to tobacco in order to elucidate the mechanisms of TD and to allow adequate prevention planning.
16881727:0	The Problem 
The Program 
The City Initiative for Newborn Health is an action-research program that aims to improve the survival and health of mothers and newborn infants in slum communities in Mumbai.
16881727:1	It has arisen from a collaboration between partner institutions representing four sectors: nongovernmental, governmental, university, and private.
16881727:2	The Society for Nutrition Education and Health Action is a nongovernmental organisation, which has a mandate to work with slum communities to improve maternal and newborn health.
16881727:3	The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is the public-sector provider of health services.
16881727:4	The International Perinatal Care Unit is an academic research unit based at University College London, United Kingdom, collaborating in applied research to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes.
16881727:5	The Social Initiatives Group of ICICI Bank is a development and research unit within one of India's largest banks.
16881727:6	Evaluation 
The implementation of public health programmes is a point at which the need for evidence meets the need to justify expenditure.
16881727:7	Since the City Initiative is an exploratory endeavour, evaluation is crucial.
16881727:8	The first phase will run for four years and will evaluate its activities with a range of methods.
16881727:9	Continuous quality-improvement activities at maternity homes and peripheral and tertiary hospitals will be evaluated through process documentation, comparison of the situation in one urban zone before and after intervention, and comparison of the situation in one zone with other municipal zones.
16881727:10	Simultaneously, the health post and community mobilisation interventions will be evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled trial.
16881727:11	Ethically, the City Initiative for Newborn Health is a partnership with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, and corporation staff is involved in all interventions.
16881727:12	Benefits to trial control areas will be improvements in services at all levels of the public health-care system.
16881727:13	Applicability in Other Settings 
Mumbai is both typical and special.
16881727:14	In some ways it is the archetypal megacity, with extensive slums, overcrowding, and a public-service system constantly trying to cope with a growing burden.
16881727:15	In other ways, it is unusual.
16881727:16	Firstly, it is affluent: constant immigration is driven by its dynamism and possibility of betterment.
16881727:17	If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere.
16881727:18	Secondly, it has a particularly structured and accountable municipal corporation, which has relatively good health services for an urban Indian setting.
16881727:19	Can the City Initiative model be applied in other towns and cities?
16881727:20	The model itself is a real-world one.
16881727:21	It engages directly with both public-sector workers and community members in the context of existing pressures like low morale, salary difficulties, absenteeism, and ossified organisational cultures.
16881727:22	For this reason, as a mode of entry and as leverage for improvement, it may be a good option for any setting.
16881727:23	It is crucial to balance the supply and demand sides of the health equation.
16881727:24	On the supply side, the group-driven appreciative model seems to be (a) generic and (b) popular with participants.
16881727:25	On the demand side, there is evidence that community groups can improve mother and child health , but most of the work to date has been rural rather than urban.
16881727:26	It remains to be seen—and this is why evaluation is so important—whether participatory models can succeed in a range of settings.
16881727:27	The critical first steps have been taken in an exciting but challenging attempt to improve urban health in India, and we need to sustain the impetus and learn from the outcomes.
16650286:0	Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, especially in China, where it has been ranked as the second leading cancer killer since the 1990s .
16650286:1	Although some advances have occurred in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, the long-term outcome for affected patients is still very poor: the 5-year recurrence rate of HCC is as high as 50% to 60% . Therefore, identifying the molecular markers that correlate with the recurrence or metastasis of HCC may help improve the outcome in these patients.
16650286:2	Angiogenesis is one of the mechanisms most critical to the postoperative recurrence and metastasis of HCC [ - ].
16650286:3	Thus, finding the molecular markers associated with angiogenesis may help identify patients at increased risk for recurrence and metastasis of HCC, and thus those who require more aggressive therapy and closer surveillance.
16650286:4	To date, however, no such marker has been definitively identified.
16650286:5	One potential marker is the degree of neovascularization (ie, the microvascular density [MVD]).
16650286:6	Several researchers have demonstrated that the MVD, as evaluated by an anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CD34-MVD), was closely correlated with the prognosis of HCC .
16650286:7	However, other investigators have not found any such correlation . These conflicting results are most likely due to the different reactivities of the anti-endothelial cell antibodies used to stain the intratumoral microvessels . 
For example, antibodies against pan-endothelial cells, such as the anti-CD34 mAb, react with not only newly formed vessels but also normal vessels trapped within tumor tissues . In contrast, the anti-CD105 mAb preferentially reacts with the activated endothelial cells of angiogenic tissues, including tumors, but weakly or not at all with the endothelial cells of most normal tissues [ - ].
16650286:8	Thus, the detection of CD105 is likely to be useful not only for its prognostic value as a means to identify candidates for specific antiangiogenic therapy.
16650286:9	In fact, some investigators have already demonstrated that the MVD of cells, determined with an anti-CD105 mAb (CD105-MVD) but not with an anti-CD34 mAb, correlates with prognosis in some other types of carcinoma, such as breast, renal cell, and colorectal carcinoma [ - ].
16650286:10	Thus, our study attempts to investigate a correlation between CD105-MVD and the postoperative recurrence or metastasis of HCC.
16650286:11	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The high incidence of postoperative recurrence and metastasis has been the major obstacle to further improving the overall survival rate of patients with HCC.
16650286:12	Recently, much attention has been paid to the association between angiogenesis and postoperative recurrence or metastasis.
16650286:13	Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, is essential for any malignant tumor, including HCC, to grow and metastasize; in fact, solid tumors cannot grow beyond 1 to 2 mm in diameter in the absence of angiogenesis.
16650286:14	Therefore, the ability to quantitatively distinguish between tumor neovascularization and pre-existing vessels is important in the assessment of tumor angiogenesis.
16650286:15	The degree of neovascularization, or MVD, is now generally identified by immunohistochemical staining of endothelial cells with the so-called pan-endothelial cell markers such as CD34, CD31, and von Willebrand factor; however, anti-pan-endothelial antibodies can react with not only newly formed vessels but also normal vessels trapped within tumor tissues.
16650286:16	Thus, the MVD identified by anti-pan-endothelial antibodies is not an ideal prognostic marker.
16650286:17	It is necessary to find a marker that specifically reacts with the endothelial cells of angiogenic tissue and not with the endothelial cells of most normal tissue.
16650286:18	Endoglin (CD105) is a proliferation-associated and hypoxia-inducible glycoprotein abundantly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells .
16650286:19	It is a receptor for the transforming growth factor β superfamily  and is essential in angiogenesis . Immunohistochemical studies have shown that CD105 is strongly expressed in blood vessels of tumor tissue.
16650286:20	The intensity of staining for CD105 is greater in blood vessel endothelia within neoplastic tissue than within normal tissues, indicating that CD105 is a powerful marker of neovascularization in solid malignancies.
16650286:21	The MVD determined with the anti-CD105 antibody has been established as an independent prognostic indicator, with increased values correlating with shorter survival times.
16650286:22	To test whether the anti-CD105 mAb reacts only with new vessels in HCC tissues, we used immunohistochemical staining to determine the CD105 expression in tumor specimens from 113 patients with HCC and correlated our findings with available follow-up information about the patients.
16650286:23	We found that the anti-CD105 mAb was an ideal marker to distinguish between the microvessels of tumor and normal tissues and that CD105-MVD was significantly correlated with prognosis in patients with HCC.
16650286:24	In addition, our finding of the expression of CD34 in both normal and tumor tissue indicated that it is not a reliable marker for HCC.
16650286:25	When we studied the correlation between the expression of MVD and VEGF, a known marker for angiogenesis, we found that although CD34-MVD was significantly correlated with VEGF expression ( r = 0.243), CD105-MVD was more closely correlated (r = 0.300).
16650286:26	This finding further showed that the anti-CD105 antibody is superior to the anti-CD34 antibody in detecting angiogenesis in HCC.
16650286:27	However, because angiogenesis is influenced not only by VEGF, to verify the view of CD105 as a marker, comparative studies need to be performed to evaluate the correlation of the CD34-MVD and the CD105-MVD with other factors that influence angiogenesis.
16650286:28	When we analyzed MVD in conjunction with the clinicopathological characteristics of the HCC tumors, we found that the CD105-MVD, but not the CD34-MVD, was strongly correlated with the presence of microscopic venous invasion; microscopic venous invasion has been shown by other studies to be one of the most accurate prognostic indicators of postoperative recurrence and metastasis in HCC [ - ].
16650286:29	This correlation also suggested that anti-CD105 antibodies react with new vessels in HCC tissue more specifically than do anti-CD34 antibodies.
16650286:30	We found no significant correlation between CD105-MVD and liver cirrhosis, tumor diameter, capsule formation, Edmondson's grade, or preoperative α-fetoprotein concentration, although other investigators have [ - ].
16650286:31	This discrepancy suggests that our results, although sensitive, are potentially not specific, and further studies will need to be done to confirm the specificity we observed for the marker.
16650286:32	Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the CD105-MVD, but not the CD34-MVD, was significantly correlated with the 2-year survival rate, and multivariate analysis showed that CD105-MVD, but not CD34-MVCD, was a significant and independent prognostic factor, which was consistent with the results of retrospective studies of other tumors.
16650286:33	Another major benefit of our study is that it identified a CD-105 as a potential target of therapy in HCC.
16650286:34	Because angiogenesis is essential for metastasis and recurrence, destroying the tumor-associated microvasculature without severely damaging normal tissues or causing major adverse effects is an appropriate goal for biological therapy.
16650286:35	An appropriate proliferation-associated antigen located on the endothelial cells of tumors could be an ideal target for this antiangiogenic therapy and have negligible adverse effects [ - ].
16650286:36	As demonstrated in our study, the anti-CD105mAb specifically reacted with the neovascular endothelial cells of HCC only.
16650286:37	Thus, CD105 may be useful not only for its prognostic ability but also in the treatment of patients with HCC.
16650286:38	Conclusion 
In summary, the anti-CD105 mAb proved to be an ideal means to quantify new vessels in HCC, and CD105-MVD was a significant and independent prognostic factor for HCC.
16650286:39	We would like to add the cautionary note that a proportion of our patients who were alive despite a relapse had a low MVD and, after a longer follow-up period, might be expected to do poorly.
16650286:40	Therefore, our findings need to be confirmed in larger cohorts of patients with a longer follow-up period.

15788752:0	INTRODUCTION 
During translation initiation, ribosomes identify the initiation codon on the mRNA and set the correct reading frame for decoding.
15788752:1	This rate-limiting step is carried out in different ways in the primary domains of cell descent.
15788752:2	In bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit interacts directly with the mRNA by base-pairing of the Shine–Dalgarno (SD) motif, preceding the initiation codon, with the anti-SD motif at the 3′ end of 16S rRNA.
15788752:3	The initiation step is assisted by three protein factors, IF1, IF2 and IF3.
15788752:4	In eukarya, selection of the initiation codon entails a ‘scanning’ mechanism, whereby the 40S subunit binds to the capped 5′ end of the mRNA and then slides downstream until the initiator AUG, usually the first one available, is encountered.
15788752:5	This process is promoted by many factors, several of which are involved in cap recognition and mRNA unwinding, while others interact with the ribosome and/or the mRNA to ensure correct selection of the initiation codon.
15788752:6	In archaea, two different mechanisms for translational initiation seem to exist.
15788752:7	One is based on a canonical SD/anti-SD interaction and operates on internal cistrons of polycistronic mRNAs.
15788752:8	In contrast, monocistronic mRNAs as well as proximal cistrons of polycistronic mRNAs are frequently devoid of a 5′-untranslated region.
15788752:9	These leaderless mRNAs are decoded by an initiation mechanism independent of the SD/anti-SD interaction, which requires, analogously to bacteria, pairing of the start codon with initiator-tRNA (tRNAi).
15788752:10	The complexity of archaeal translational initiation seems to be underscored by the presence of a larger-than-bacterial set of initiation factors.
15788752:11	All archaeal genomes encode about 10 proteins homologous to eukaryal initiation factors.
15788752:12	A central step in translation initiation is the delivery of tRNAi to the ribosomal P site.
15788752:13	This task is assisted in bacteria by the monomeric protein IF2, and is performed in eukarya by the trimeric complex eIF2, consisting of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits, none of which is homologous to bacterial IF2.
15788752:14	Eukarya possess a homologue of bacterial IF2, termed eIF5B, which seems to act at a later initiation step, promoting the joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation complex.
15788752:15	Like eukarya, archaea possess both IF2 and eIF2 homologues, but their respective functions remain poorly characterized.
15788752:16	In this study, we have analysed a number of functional features of the eIF2-like protein (herein denoted as a/eIF2) of the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus . The genome of this organism, as well as those of the other archaea sequenced so far, contains homologues of all three subunits of the eukaryal factor.
15788752:17	In S.solfataricus the largest subunit is the γ-homologue, which comprises 415 amino acids and contains a recognizable G-domain.
15788752:18	The α-subunit homologue contains 266 amino acids.
15788752:19	The β-subunit is the smallest polypeptide of a/eIF2 (139 amino acids in S.solfataricus ) and has experienced the most extensive evolutionary drift with respect to the eukaryotic protein.
15788752:20	Indeed, eukaryotic β-subunits are about twice the size of archaeal ones, and include domains involved in the interaction with two other proteins essential for eIF2 function: eIF2B, a factor required for GDP/GTP exchange and eIF5, necessary for the hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP ( – ).
15788752:21	Neither eIF2B nor eIF5 have homologues in archaeal genomes.
15788752:22	The conserved region of the β-subunit in archaea and eukaryotes includes a domain containing a zinc-finger motif, which has been implicated in controlling the accuracy of initiation codon recognition.
15788752:23	Recently, it has been shown that the recombinant α-, β- and γ-subunits of a/eIF2 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi can re-associate in vitro to form a trimer able to bind selectively Met-tRNAi.
15788752:24	The tRNA binding site seems to reside on the γ-subunit, however an α–γ dimer is required for a stable interaction with Met-tRNAi.
15788752:25	In this work, we have cloned the genes and purified the corresponding three subunits of a/eIF2 from the crenarchaeon S.solfataricus . In vitro assays carried out with the individual a/eIF2 subunits, with dimers thereof and with the complete trimer have confirmed that the factor binds Met-tRNAi, and that this GTP-dependent binding requires the α–γ dimer.
15788752:26	We also show that a/eIF2 α–γ and α–β–γ strongly stimulate binding of Met-tRNAi to the small ribosomal subunit in the presence of GTP.
15788752:27	Furthermore, an analysis of guanine nucleotide exchange has revealed that a/eIF2 has a similar affinity for GTP and GDP, and that the G nucleotide binding properties of the isolated γ-subunit are similar to those of the complete factor.
15788752:28	In addition, the γ-subunit was found to be responsible for the interaction of the factor with ribosomes.
15788752:29	Finally, we show that a/eIF2 lacks an intrinsic ribosome-dependent GTPase activity.
15788752:30	The differences and similarities with the eukaryal factor are discussed.
15788752:31	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we have analysed several functional aspects of the eIF2 homologue from the thermophilic archaeon S.solfataricus . The purified recombinant a/eIF2 subunits readily assembled in vitro to form dimeric and trimeric complexes.
15788752:32	As observed previously for P.abyssi a/eIF2, we found that the S.solfataricus a/eIF2 γ-subunit constitutes the structural core of the trimeric complex since it interacts with both α- and β-subunits as well as individually with either of them.
15788752:33	In contrast, the α- and β-subunits are unable to interact with each other independent of the γ-polypeptide.
15788752:34	Protein–protein recognition is independent of both GTP and high temperature.
15788752:35	The recombinant trimeric S.solfataricus a/eIF2 displays properties very similar to those of its eukaryal counterpart: it interacts with Met-tRNAi, and stimulates its binding to the small ribosomal subunits.
15788752:36	Taken together with the results of Yatime et al ., we therefore conclude that a/eIF2 is the principal tRNAi binding factor in archaea.
15788752:37	The archaeal and eukaryal IF2 factors display several notable functional differences, which may aid towards a better understanding of the evolutionary history of this protein.
15788752:38	One difference concerns the tRNAi-binding site.
15788752:39	According to a recent crystallographic analysis, the γ-subunit of P.abyssi a/eIF2 includes an apparently complete tRNAi-binding domain similar to that of elongation factor Tu, another translational G-protein with tRNA-binding properties.
15788752:40	In agreement with this finding, the γ-subunit of a/eIF2 does possess some intrinsic capacity for Met-tRNAi binding: it protects the tRNA-bound methionine from alkaline hydrolysis, and it can promote to some extent binding of Met-tRNAi to the 30S ribosomal subunits.
15788752:41	Nevertheless, a stable interaction with Met-tRNAi is only achieved by a α–γ dimer, and therefore requires the presence of the α-subunit.
15788752:42	It has been found that the C-terminal portion of the α-subunit is sufficient for stable tRNA binding.
15788752:43	However, the precise role of the α-subunit in Met-tRNAi binding by the trimeric a/eIF2, or by the α–γ complex, remains to be elucidated.
15788752:44	In contrast, in eukaryal IF2 the Met-tRNAi binding site seems to be shared between the γ- and the β-subunits, while the main function of the α-subunit is the regulation of the factor activity.
15788752:45	It should be pointed out that the eukaryal β-subunit is about twice the size of its archaeal counterpart, and, besides Met-tRNAi binding, is implicated in several other essential tasks, such as controlling the interaction with eIF5 and eIF2B ( – ), and possibly mRNA binding.
15788752:46	Only the C-terminal half of the eukaryal polypeptide is conserved in the archaeal one, while the N-terminal moiety, containing the interaction domains for eIF2B and eIF5, has been apparently added during eukaryotic evolution.
15788752:47	Therefore, if the eukaryal β-subunit is involved in the interaction with tRNAi, this function is most likely acquired during eukaryotic evolution and not present in the ancestral β-subunit of a/eIF2.
15788752:48	Another relevant functional difference between a/eIF2 and eIF2 concerns the binding of guanine nucleotides.
15788752:49	The eukaryal protein has a much higher affinity for GDP than for GTP and requires a GDP/GTP exchange factor, the pentameric protein eIF5B, to be reactivated after GTP hydrolysis.
15788752:50	In contrast, the analysis presented here of guanine nucleotide binding and exchange on a/eIF2 allows the conclusion that the archaeal factor has a similar affinity for GDP and GTP ( and ), and therefore might not require an exchange factor.
15788752:51	This agrees with the observation that archaeal genomes lack a complete eIF5B homologue.
15788752:52	It is also worth noting that in lower eukaryotes (yeast), eIF2 seems to have a reduced requirement for the exchange factor when compared with the mammalian protein.
15788752:53	These data suggest the possibility that the free-nucleotide-exchanging archaeal a/eIF2 represents the prototype factor from which an exchange factor-dependent one has evolved in eukaryotes, which provided additional or even a more sophisticated translational control.
15788752:54	Taken together, these observations would suggest that no eukaryal-type functional regulation of a/eIF2 based on the inhibition of guanine nucleotide exchange exists in archaea.
15788752:55	However, it has been recently reported that the α-subunit of Pyrococcus horikoscii a/eIF2 is phosphorylated by a specific protein kinase.
15788752:56	Thus, the determination of the function of α-subunit phosphorylation of archaeal a/eIF2 will be an interesting task, which may help to clarify why archaea, unlike bacteria but like eukarya, have adopted a trimeric Met-tRNAi binding factor.
15788752:57	Another unresolved problem concerns GTP hydrolysis.
15788752:58	Given the lack of an eIF5 homologue, our expectation was to find a ribosome-triggered, but otherwise spontaneous, hydrolysis of a/eIF2-bound GTP.
15788752:59	However, all our attempts to reveal in vitro the presence of such a mechanism failed.
15788752:60	Therefore, the possibility exists that archaea possess a domain-specific auxiliary GTPase, different from eIF5.
15788752:61	Some years ago, Kyrpides and Woese suggested that the auxiliary GTPase of a/eIF2 might be aIF2, the universal factor homologous to bacterial IF2 and eukaryal eIF5B.
15788752:62	The aIF2 protein is a G protein and does possess a ribosome-dependent GTPase activity (A.
15788752:63	Berardi, S. Marzi, E. Maone, L. Peri, C. O.
15788752:64	Gualerzi, P. Cammarano and P. Londei, unpublished data).
15788752:65	An interesting outcome of our study is the general conclusion that most of the functions of the factor are carried out by its largest component, the γ-subunit.
15788752:66	At least in vitro the γ-subunit has retained some intrinsic ability to interact with Met-tRNAi, to bind to the small ribosomal subunits, and to promote the interaction between Met-tRNAi and the ribosome.
15788752:67	The α-subunit is clearly involved in stabilizing Met-tRNAi binding, while the function of the small β-subunit remains elusive at the moment.
15788752:68	On the whole, these observations suggest that the γ-subunit functioned as a monomer early in evolution, preceding the time when the archaeal–eukaryal line split into two separate domains.
15788752:69	This hypothesis agrees with the fact that the γ-subunit of eIF2-like proteins belongs to a family of tRNA-binding G-proteins that includes the elongation factor Tu/1-A and its specialized version SELB.
15788752:70	The latter is the factor that selects selenocysteine tRNA during the synthesis of selenoproteins in all primary domains ( – ).
15788752:71	The γ-subunit of eukaryal and archaeal IF2 is most closely related to SELB, suggesting that the a/eIF2 γ-subunit arose by gene duplication from elongation factor Tu at about the same time as SELB.
15788752:72	Each of the two proteins became then specialized for interacting with a single aminoacyl-tRNA species, whereas the elongation factor Tu retained the capacity to bind any aminoacyl-tRNA.
15788752:73	Probably, a/eIF2 acquired a selective affinity for Met-tRNAi during the evolution of the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya.
15788752:74	However, a/eIF2 must soon have acquired its present trimeric form, as genes encoding the α- and β-subunits are found in all archaea, including the hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans which has a genome size of only 0.5 Mb.
19706153:0	Introduction 
Extensive exposure to cigarette smoke is a principal risk factor associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
19706153:1	COPD is a complex inflammatory disease involving numerous inflammatory cell types, which have the capacity to release multiple inflammatory mediators.
19706153:2	An increase in expression of many of these mediators translates to activation of an inflammatory cascade involving cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules [ - ]; specific to COPD are increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interferon-γ(IFNγ), interleukin-8(IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α(MIP-1α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1), GROα, and matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-9 [ - ].
19706153:3	NF-κB is a family of critical transcription factors regulating many cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MIP-1, and MCP-1 , as well as MMP-9 expression . In the past few years, five mammalian NF-κB family members have been identified and cloned [ - ].
19706153:4	These include NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel.
19706153:5	In resting cells NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm due to inhibitory protein (I-κB) binding.
19706153:6	When the cell is appropriately stimulated, I-κB degradation results in the ability of NF-κB to recognition nuclear localization signals of p65, thus it is rapidly transported into the nucleus where it binds to specific κB recognition elements in the promoters of target genes . Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke causes cellular oxidative stress, a key feature in smoking-induced lung inflammation [ - ], and oxidative stress (particularly hydrogen peroxide) can enhance the DNA binding activity of NF-κB .
19706153:7	It has been demonstrated in humans and animal models that smoke-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation is associated with increased NF-κB activity in lung cells.
19706153:8	Enhanced NF-κB activation has been observed in bronchial biopsies from smokers, macrophages from COPD patients and in guinea pigs exposed to cigarette smoke, with a subsequent increase in IL-8 release [ - ].
19706153:9	During the past few years, tremendous progress has been achieved in our understanding on how intracellular signaling pathways are transmitted in either a linear or a network manner leading to the activation of NF-κB and airway inflammation control [ - ].
19706153:10	However, a detailed role in long-term smoke-induced inflammation and the impact of NF-κB inhibition on histology and airflow obstruction has yet to be determined.
19706153:11	Therefore, we have used NF-κB decoy ODNs to block NF-κB activity in mouse lung during long-term smoke exposure.
19706153:12	It is well known that transfection of cis -element double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (decoy) has been identified as a powerful tool in a new class of anti-gene strategies for gene therapy and research . Transfection of decoys corresponding to a specific cis sequence results in the attenuation of endogenous cis -elements, and subsequent modulation of gene expression . 
We hypothesized that in the long-term smoke-induced mouse model double-stranded ODNs decoy to NF-κB would suppress the pulmonary expression levels of inflammation-related genes and MMP-9/TIMP-1 gene that may play a role in the development of emphysema.
19706153:13	The other purpose of this study was to assess the potential of NF-κB decoy ODNs to histological influence.
19706153:14	Based on the evidence that early structural changes may occur in peripheral airways of smokers before COPD , we further measured small-airway changes.
19706153:15	Since NF-κB and AP-1 may regulate each other , both of NF-κB and AP-1 activities were measured after intratracheal administration of NF-κB decoy ODNs in 92 day smoke-induced mice.
19706153:16	Therefore, the present study was performed to determine the effects of NF-κB decoy ODNs on lung inflammation and pathological changes in the cigarette smoke-induced animal model.
19706153:17	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Smoke-induced chronic airway inflammation may be mediated by overwhelming inflammatory dysregulation caused by overexpression of not one or several but many NF-κB regulated genes.
19706153:18	We here tested the hypothesis that blockade of NF-κB transcriptional activity, via phosphorothioate-modified decoy ODNs containing the NF-κB consensus binding site, would improve smoke-induced chronic airway inflammation and prevent lung dysfunction in the mouse model system.
19706153:19	Our results provided evidence that local administration of decoy through trachea indeed make a strong decrease of a population of macrophages in BALF and alveolar space of smoke-induced mice.
19706153:20	Moreover, NF-κB-regulated chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-α were strongly repressed in mice BALF after administration of NF-κB decoy ODNs intratracheally compared with NS-treated smoke-triggered mice.
19706153:21	Conversely, NF-κB decoy ODNs increased release of TNF-α and pro-MMP-9 in the mice BALF.
19706153:22	These data show that NF-κB decoy ODNs have both repressive and stimulating effects on NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes in the mouse model.
19706153:23	We report here that intratracheal administration of decoy ODNs, but not scrambled control, abrogated NF-κB activation in whole lung following long-term cigarette exposure; furthermore, we determined that such treatment was very effective in preventing the development of lung dysfunction and macrophage aggregation in the airway.
19706153:24	Systemic or local injection of "naked" NF-κB decoys may effectively inhibit NF-κB activation and thereby prevent inflammation in vivo . As reported here, we've demonstrated that intratracheal administration of "naked"NF-κB decoys with modified phosphorothioate backbones resulted in reduced NF-κB activation, while no effect was observed after scrambled ODN administration.
19706153:25	The decoy ODNs used in this study were phosphorothioated and therefore resistant to degradation.
19706153:26	Although we cannot exclude that the decoy ODNs were damaged through smoke exposure, there is good evidence that 24 h after intravenous injection at least 50% of phosphoratioated ODN in the lung were intact . We have previously shown that NF-κB activation slightly increased compared to air-exposure mice in a model of subacute inflammation . Here, we demonstrate that long-term smoke exposure in mice enhanced NF-κB activity in the nuclear extracts of lung tissue.
19706153:27	The success in vivo transfer of a sufficient quantity of NF-κB decoy ODN into lungs was confirmed by the gel shift assay.
19706153:28	These results encouraged us to study the potential of NF-κB decoy ODNs for pulmonary smoke-induced chronic airway inflammation by in vivo via intratracheal administration.
19706153:29	Conclusion 
We reported here that local NF-κB inhibition was associated with attenuated MIP-1α and MCP-1 expression simultaneously, macrophage influx in the airway and lung parenchyma, and marked improvement in respiratory function of mice in response to long-term smoke exposure.
19706153:30	Our studies suggest that inhibitors of NF-κB may offer promise as a therapeutic approach for the improvement of smoke-triggered pulmonary dysfunction.
19706153:31	Furthermore, our pathological analysis of the macrophages reduction in lungs of mice and macrophages recruitment-related cytokines decrease also provides useful information about NF-κB decoy ODNs for a model of experimental smoke-induced chronic inflammation.

16807980:0	INTRODUCTION 
A lumbar fusion through an available surgical technique, can reduce pain and decrease disability in patients with chronic lower back pain (LBP).
16807980:1	Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has the advantages of restoring the disc height, immobilizing the unstable degenerated intervertebral disc area, decompressing the nerve roots, and restoring load bearing to anterior structures.
16807980:2	The use of two cages has recently become routinely as a standard PLIF technique.
16807980:3	However, it is very difficult to insert two cages of an appropriate size without surgical destruction of the posterior element of the spine.
16807980:4	Extensive laminectomy and bilateral facetectomy cause iatrogenic instability of the posterior elements, which may cause postoperative back pain syndrome.
16807980:5	Therefore, most clinical reports recommend that PLIF should be combined with pedicle screw fixation for a good clinical and radiological outcome.
16807980:6	However, the wide exposure required for a circumferential fusion can cause unnecessary trauma to the lumbar musculoligamentous complex, which is one of the causes of a poor postoperative outcome.
16807980:7	Most patients with a chronic disc herniation of the lumbar spine suffer from long standing LBP with instability.
16807980:8	This is sometimes combined with a unilateral radiating leg pain, relative to the location of the disc herniation.
16807980:9	We performed a PLIF, using two PEEK™ (Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone) O.I.C.
16807980:10	cages, with a unilateral medial facetectomy and hemilaminectomy, to avoid extensive iatrogenic destabilization of the posterior elements of the lumbar spine.
16807980:11	Forty-one patients with unilateral leg pain accompanied by instability were treated with this unilateral approach.
16807980:12	In this report we present our surgical experience, results of an average follow-up of 26-months, and a review of the literature regarding PLIF.
16807980:13	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
All patients underwent a one-level fusion.
16807980:14	The vertebral levels at which the implants were inserted were as follows: L2-3 (one patient), L4-5 (25 patients), and L5-S1 (15 patients).
16807980:15	With regard to the complications, there was one case of transient weakness of the foot.
16807980:16	A re-operation was required in 1 patient due to implant migration.
16807980:17	No implant fractures or deformities occurred.
16807980:18	At the time of the last follow-up visit, 37 patients (90%) were satisfied with the results of the surgery.
16807980:19	No patients, with the exception of one, felt they were worse after the surgery.
16807980:20	Twenty-five patients (61%) experienced excellent results, 12 (29%) had good results, three (7%) had fair results, and one (2%) had a poor clinical result.
16807980:21	The radicular symptoms were resolved in all patients, with the exception of three, who still suffer from mild discomfort of the leg.
16807980:22	One patient, with worsened LBP 1 year after surgery, underwent a percutaneous pedicle screw fixation using the Sextant system.
16807980:23	A good outcome was achieved 6 months after the second operation.
16807980:24	A successful radiographic fusion was achieved at the time of the last follow-up in 35 patients (85%).
16807980:25	demonstrates a case of solid fusion after PLIF via a unilateral approach.
16807980:26	The fusion status was not associated with the clinical outcome ( p = 0.15).
16807980:27	The majority of patients felt they had improved postoperatively and would opt for the same surgery again.
16807980:28	The average disc height before surgery was 8.1 mm, which was restored to an average of 11.7 mm immediate after surgery.
16807980:29	At the last follow-up, the average disc height had decrease to 10.1 mm.
16807980:30	The disc height after the PLIF procedure was increased significantly.
16807980:31	However, there was no corelation between the change of disc height and the Prolo scale.
16807980:32	DISCUSSION 
Over the last few decades, surgical fusion of the lumbar spine has been increasingly performed on patients with chronic LBP.
16807980:33	A variety of different surgical techniques can be used to achieve lumbar fusion.
16807980:34	Posterolateral fusion has been one of the standards for surgical treatment of lumbar spinal instability, and with the use of spinal instrumentation, it has been widely used for lumbar degenerative pathology.
16807980:35	However, posterolateral fusion may not restore the disc space height or sagittal segmental alignment, even when spinal instrumentation is used.
16807980:36	The origin of chronic LBP remains unclear and controversial.
16807980:37	In degenerative disc disease with instability, the major source of the pain is thought to be a result of the degenerative disc itself and/or the facet joints.
16807980:38	If the source of pain is believed to be a degenerative disc, it seems reasonable to remove this structure and replace it with a bone transplant, using either PLIF or anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF).
16807980:39	PLIF, pioneered by Cloward, has the advantage of allowing the restoration of the disc space height, sagittal plane alignment, and weight bearing through the anterior column.
16807980:40	- Since the introduction of various cages for PLIF, the surgical technique and its outcomes have been greatly improved.
16807980:41	An interbody fusion with a cage alone has been increasingly accepted for the treatment of a lumbar degenerative change.
16807980:42	However, PLIF with a stand-alone cage has been criticized by many spine surgeons due to the need for removing a significant amount of the posterior supporting spinal structures.
16807980:43	This can be achieved by a bilateral facetectomy or a wide laminectomy, for the bilateral placement of the cage into the disc space.
16807980:44	Therefore, most surgeons recommend that PLIF should be supplemented by posterior instrumentation.
16807980:45	, However, a greater exposure and disruption of the posterior elements would be needed to perform a circumferential fusion of the unstable segment.
16807980:46	There are several reports that an iatrogenic soft-tissue injury correlates with negative long-term clinical outcomes.
16807980:47	Excessive intra-operative dissection and retraction of the paraspinal musculature can lead to denervation and atrophy.
16807980:48	The damaged muscle tissue acts as a pain generator, which results in an increased risk of"failed back syndrome".
16807980:49	Extensive bilateral facetectomy is also associated with postoperative pain and prolonged disability.
16807980:50	Therefore, in patients with chronic LBP with a unilateral disc herniation, wide exposure and circumferential fusion may produce iatrogenic flat back syndrome or contralateral leg discomfort, despite the improvement in ipsilateral leg pain.
16807980:51	Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion is another surgical method to achieve successful fusion with no risk of nerve root injury.
16807980:52	With this approach, the intervertebral disc can be accessed, unilaterally, through the neural foramen for the introduction of the bone graft material or a fusion cage.
16807980:53	Many surgeons favor this approach over PLIF for the treatment of spondylolisthesis.
16807980:54	However, this approach also has the disadvantage of a wide exposure of the lumbar spine in patients with a single level instability without spondylolisthesis.
16807980:55	In 1985, Blume reported that unilateral PLIF with a bone dowel and cancellous bone chip had the advantage of preserving the posterior ligament structure.
16807980:56	Conversely, a bone graft without cages may cause disc space collapse in the long-term.
16807980:57	Zhao et al. recently reported on the use of a single threaded interbody fusion cage, placed obliquely, for degenerative spondylolisthesis.
16807980:58	They found that a unilateral facetectomy enabled sufficient decompression for the safe placement of the cage device, while maintaining the important posterior supporting spinal structures.
16807980:59	They reported that PLIF using a single long threaded cage inserted obliquely through a unilateral facetectomy and hemilaminectomy, was significantly stiffer than that achieved with two posterior cages inserted through a bilateral facetectomy and laminectomy.
16807980:60	Abumi et al. found that a bilateral facetectomy produced a marked increases in the motions of flexion and axial rotation, whereas a unilateral facetectomy produced less increases in motion, especially in rotation.
16807980:61	Therefore, by avoiding bilateral facet disruption, surgeons can achieve solid fusion with PLIF.
16807980:62	With our surgical approach, we can save most portions of the posterior elements, including the spinous process and all the structures on the contralateral side.
16807980:63	A total facetectomy on the ipsilateral side is not required.
16807980:64	In contrast to the single cage technique, we used two cages with a unilateral approach.
16807980:65	It was possible to insert two appropriately sized cages using this unilateral approach with the decompression of unilateral stenosis, with no major complications.
16807980:66	A unilateral partial hemi-laminectomy and medial facetectomy, which is the most common procedure for a simple disc herniation, is enough for a PLIF with two cages to be achieved.
16807980:67	Since the remaining posterior elements can maintain their physiological range of motion in flexion and rotation, we think that supplemental posterior instrumentation is not necessary as long as the facet joints are preserved.
16807980:68	To increase the solid fusion rate, it is essential to increase the area of the bone fusion and the total amount of graft bone.
16807980:69	Another advantage of our approach is that an additional bone graft could be implanted before the insertion of the cage into the contralateral intervertebral space, with no risk of bone graft retropulsion or collapse.
16807980:70	Compared to the cylindrical cage, a rectangular PEEK cage is smaller, which eliminates the need for extensive retraction of the neural tissue or the total removal of the facet joints, for its insertion.
16807980:71	We had one case of cage retropulsion that required re-operation.
16807980:72	There is a risk of posterior migration when rounded, stand-alone cages are used.
16807980:73	This can be prevented by the surgeon using an appropriate cage.
16807980:74	PLIF in revision surgery is a technically demanding procedure.
16807980:75	Chitnavis et al., reported excellent results following a PLIF using a carbon cage in patients with recurrent disc herniations.
16807980:76	They proposed that the cage offered structural support while biological fusion occurred.
16807980:77	However, most patients with recurrent disc herniations usually have unilateral leg pain.
16807980:78	A bilateral approach may cause pain or sensory disturbance to the contralateral leg.
16807980:79	We performed our surgical method in 6 patients with recurrent disc herniations accompanied by segmental instability.
16807980:80	Of these patients, 4 had excellent clinical outcomes, and the other 2 had good outcomes.
16807980:81	No patient felt their condition was worse after the surgery.
16807980:82	At the time of the last follow-up visit, 4 patients were not satisfied with the results of the surgery.
16807980:83	Of these, two patients had a normal disc space but with flexion instability.
16807980:84	A facet fracture occurred during the insertion of larger cages into the intervertebral space, and the cages and grafted bone were unable to fully fill the intervertebral space.
16807980:85	We had difficulty moving the first cages to the contralateral side and inserting the two large cages through the unilateral route.
16807980:86	One of them underwent percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with the Sextant system.
16807980:87	This produced a good outcome 6 months after the second operation.
16807980:88	Two other patients had a mild to moderate degree of LBP despite a radiological solid fusion at the time of the last follow-up.
16807980:89	In our series, the radiological fusion rate was slightly lower than that with other PLIF techniques.
16807980:90	A sound fusion is thought to be a parameter for clinical success in patients with mechanical LBP.
16807980:91	However, the fusion rates did not correlate with the clinical outcomes in our patients.
16807980:92	In previous studies, the clinical outcome did not always parallel the radiographically solid fusion.
16807980:93	Agazzi et al. have reported that a PLIF with a cage may restore and maintain the disc height and the sagittal balance.
16807980:94	This may improve the clinical results despite the lack of solid fusion.
16807980:95	The primary indication from our operative method was a chronic degenerative disc disease with unilateral leg pain combined with radiological instability, but without spondylolisthesis.
16807980:96	This technique can manage both problems successfully, without the need for a circumferential operation.
16807980:97	The limitations of this unilateral approach for bilateral PLIF include, instability with a normal disc height, spondylolisthesis, and bilateral foraminal stenosis, requiring bilateral decompression.
16807980:98	Further study and long-term follow-up will be necessary.
16807980:99	A posterior lumbar interbody fusion with two cages, via a unilateral approach, enables sufficient decompression and solid interbody fusion to be achieved, while the majority of the posterior elements are maintained.
16807980:100	It is an ideal procedure in a patient with severe symptomatic axial LBP with radiculopathy from disc herniation or stenosis.

20535272:0	Introduction 
Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients over 50 years of age.
20535272:1	Fellow eye involvement has been reported in 15% of patients at five years, according to one study.
20535272:2	However, bilateral simultaneous AION is rare and frequently associated to severe hypotensive situations.
20535272:3	Patients under renal replacement therapy may be at special risk for developing AION.
20535272:4	It is well known how patients under long-term dialysis are prone to accelerated atherosclerotic disease, which, together with anemia, are known predisposing factors for this condition.
20535272:5	Hypotension, on the other hand, seems to be the most common precipitating factor, both in the normal and the dialysis population.
20535272:6	We present two cases of bilateral, blinding AION that show how hypotension may precipitate this devastating complication in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
20535272:7	Case Reports 
Discussion 
Acute visual loss caused by optic neuropathy in patients under chronic dialysis challenges the ophthalmologist to diagnose mainly between ischemic and uremic optic neuropathies.
20535272:8	Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) typically presents as sudden, painless visual loss that many patients report on awakening, accompanied by an afferent pupillary defect and optic disc edema.
20535272:9	Visual field testing most frequently shows nerve fiber bundle defects, being inferior altitudinal the most usual.
20535272:10	Bilateral simultaneous AION is extremely rare in normal patients if not related to severe blood loss during long surgeries or trauma.
20535272:11	Bilateral involvement is however very common in chronic dialysis patients who suffer from AION; of the 12 cases reported (together with ours) in adults and not related to optic disc drusen, nine were bilateral.
20535272:12	Uremic optic neuropathy, on the other hand, is an infrequent condition that affects patients with extremely high renal parameters, which is rare in chronic dialysis patients.
20535272:13	It is usually found in subjects with undiagnosed renal disease.
20535272:14	It has been postulated that direct toxicity to the optic nerve by dialyzable metabolites would cause a visual impairment that would be reversible if cleared soon enough from the patient's serum.
20535272:15	Knox reported significant improvement in five of six patients who underwent prompt treatment with hemodialysis and steroids.
20535272:16	Both our patients had serum creatinine within reasonable limits, which together with the clinical picture made us think of AION.
20535272:17	Toxic optic neuropathy is another concern in these patients.
20535272:18	Although only anecdotally, it has been reported with the use of desferrioxamine and OKT3 in dialysis patients.
20535272:19	This is a very rare entity and should always be an exclusion diagnosis.
20535272:20	It is our opinion that AION should always be the first suspicion in a dialyzed patient with an acute optic neuropathy.
20535272:21	It is well known that patients under dialysis are prone to hypotensive events.
20535272:22	Reviewing the scarce literature on AION and dialysis, we find that most cases have been related to hypotension.
20535272:23	Peritoneal dialysis, because of its continuous nature, would theoretically have less risk of blood pressure drops, but the cases reported are distributed equally into both the peritoneal and hemodialysis groups.
20535272:24	Hypotension was clearly the precipitating factor in both our patients.
20535272:25	Although we did not obtain ambulatory monitoring in our first patient, he reported visual loss on awakening, and had repeatedly low morning arterial blood pressure recordings.
20535272:26	Hayreh described nocturnal hypotension as the most important precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of AION in normal patients, and it is nowadays the best explanation to why so many patients with AION complain of visual loss an awakening.
20535272:27	Interestingly, Jackson described ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a patient under peritoneal dialysis who suffered bilateral AION, showing severe drops in nocturnal blood pressure, with diastolic readings of as low as 41 mmHg.
20535272:28	Although Conolly reported moderate visual recovery in hypotensive AION following vigorous blood pressure raise, most published reports on hypotensive AION (dialysis related or not) have found treatment far from satisfactory.
20535272:29	Systemic steroids are often prescribed in AION but there is no solid evidence that favor their use.
20535272:30	When dealing with patients under chronic dialysis, prevention of severe hypotensive events is of outmost importance, and nephrologists should be aware of this potentially blinding disease.
20535272:31	Even though we were unfortunately unable to protect the right eye of our second patient, achieving the best possible control of both anemia and blood pressure is probably the only way of preventing this catastrophic disorder.
20535272:32	Similar to AION in giant cell arteritis patients, we believe acute unilateral AION in a renal replacement patient should be considered an interdisciplinary emergency with high risk of developing AION in the fellow eye.
21127903:0	Introduction 
Almost 50 years have passed since Hubel and Wiesel  described the receptive field structure of cells in the cat’s dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN).
21127903:1	They found geniculate cells to have concentric receptive fields of on- or off-centre type, just like retinal ganglion cells.
21127903:2	The only obvious difference was an increased peripheral antagonism of the centre response, which they proposed to be due to local inhibition in the dLGN.
21127903:3	Shortly afterwards, postsynaptic inhibitory potentials were recorded in geniculate cells by several investigators . Today, it is known that geniculate principal cells are equipped with two inhibitory circuits: a feedforward inhibitory system with the responsible interneurons located within the main layers of the dLGN and a recurrent inhibitory system with the interneurons confined to the perigeniculate nucleus [ , ].
21127903:4	Both types of inhibitory neurons have GABA as their main transmitter.
21127903:5	The inhibitory circuits are similar but functionally segregated for X and Y cells . Apparently, the dLGN is composed of a large number of interdigitated neuronal “processing units” formed by individual principal cells and their inhibitory circuits . 
These dLGN processing units have been analysed with anatomical and electrical stimulation techniques.
21127903:6	While such procedures are excellent to reveal the serial order of connections between cells they cannot be used to identify other functionally important aspects of the circuitry such as the spatial distribution and receptive field type of the involved neurons.
21127903:7	Nor can they reveal whether the feedforward or the recurrent inhibitory pathway is responsible for a particular inhibitory effect in the principal cell response to visual stimulation.
21127903:8	Many studies, primarily based on indirect techniques, have aimed to elucidate such functions [ , ], and a variety of models for dLGN inhibition have been proposed, none of which has received general acceptance.
21127903:9	The problem is clearly related to the difficulty to differentiate between true inhibition and disfacilitation, i.e. reduced excitation of the principal cells.
21127903:10	It seems firmly established, however, that the enhanced antagonistic surround of dLGN neurons is due to GABAergic inhibition . 
Two recent studies have reiterated the described difficulties.
21127903:11	In an elegant in vitro study in mice, Blitz and Regehr  convincingly demonstrated that many feedforward IPSPs in principal cells are time-locked to unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from retinal ganglion cells.
21127903:12	This coupling, observed also in the cat , implies that at least some feedforward inhibition is provided by the very same retinal ganglion cells as the excitation.
21127903:13	The other study, focusing on principal cell responses to natural visual scenes, arrived at the contrary conclusion, namely, that the feedforward inhibition originates from the opposing type of retinal ganglion cell . There is clearly a need to resolve this issue, especially since the two inhibitory systems appear to be independently controlled from the brain stem  and the basal forebrain . Such connections open the possibility that the two types of inhibition and thus, the visual transfer through the dLGN, might be differentially regulated in various behavioral situations.
21127903:14	In an attempt to resolve the disagreement in this otherwise well-studied system, we have combined direct intracellular recordings of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in dLGN principal cells with adequate visual stimulation.
21127903:15	Our procedure with strong cell depolarisation allowed feedforward and recurrent IPSPs to be distinguished and the receptive field structure of the two inhibitory mechanisms to be analysed.
21127903:16	Experimental procedures 
Results 
The present report is based on intracellular recordings from 51 functionally identified principal cells (25 X and 26 Y types).
21127903:17	Half the sample consisted of on-centre cells (14 X, 12 Y), the rest were off-centre cells (11 X, 14 Y).
21127903:18	Six X cells had antidromic latencies (for cortical stimulation) above 2.2 ms and slow responses to visual stimulation, indicating that they belonged to the lagged X cell category . Such cells are known to be among the smallest X cells . They did not differ in any other respect from the rest of the X cell sample, but including them made us to believe that we have studied a representative sample of X and Y principal cells.
21127903:19	A summary of various cell parameters is provided in the supplement (Fig.
21127903:20	S ).
21127903:21	Discussion 
The present results demonstrate that the feedforward and recurrent inhibitory pathways of the dLGN carry different information and thus may subserve different functions.
21127903:22	While the recurrent pathway combines information from the on- and off-centre systems, the feedforward pathway is type-specific, with the inhibition exclusively originating from the same type of retinal ganglion cells as the excitation.
21127903:23	The receptive fields of both types of inhibition are bell-shaped and aligned with the excitatory receptive field.
21127903:24	The diameter of the feedforward inhibitory field is about twice that for excitation while the recurrent inhibitory field is about two to four times larger.
17002504:0	Etiology and Distribution 
Human onchocerciasis is caused by the filarial parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus . Adult worms (macrofilariae) live in subcutaneous nodules and deeper worm bundles, where fertilized females can produce, during an average of 10 years, millions of microfilariae responsible for the morbidity associated with the infection.
17002504:1	Ingested during a bloodmeal by Simulium (black fly) vectors, microfilariae develop within the fly to infective (L3) stages, that are then transmissible to other people.
17002504:2	Many simuliid species have been incriminated to a greater or lesser degree in the transmission of O. volvulus , their relative vectorial roles contributing to shape diverse transmission patterns across endemic areas.
17002504:3	In Africa, the Simulium damnosum sensu lato (s.l.) species complex, which includes approximately 60 cytoforms, is responsible for more than 95 percent of onchocerciasis cases globally . In Latin America, S. ochraceum s.l., S. exiguum s.l., S. metallicum s.l., and S. guianense s.l. are the main vectors, respectively, in Mexico and Guatemala (about 360,000 people at risk), Colombia and Ecuador (24,600), northern Venezuela (104,500), and southern Venezuela and Brazil (20,000)  
O. volvulus is endemic in 27 sub-Saharan African countries, the Yemen , and was imported through the slave trade to six Latin American countries.
17002504:4	Previous estimates have placed the number of people infected worldwide at 18 million , 99 percent of them in Africa.
17002504:5	Since then, the true extent of the disease has been estimated by REMO (rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis).
17002504:6	Villages are selected in each river basin according to appropriate criteria, and levels of endemicity are assessed by onchocercal nodule prevalence in adult host samples . By 2005, more than 22,000 villages in Africa (outside the OCP area) had been surveyed, allowing the identification of many new foci.
17002504:7	The new infected populations thus found, together with their demographic increase, certainly compensate for the number of cases prevented by the OCP (where it was estimated that roughly 3 million people were infected ).
17002504:8	Presently, it is estimated that 37 million people carry O. volvulus with 90 million at risk in Africa . 
Clinical Manifestations and Pathogenesis 
Onchocerciasis is better known as river blindness because of the high prevalence of blindness in villages located along fast-flowing rivers, where the vectors breed.
17002504:9	Up to 500,000 cases of severe visual impairment (including visual field reduction), and 270,000 of blindness have been attributed to onchocerciasis , but, again, these figures certainly underestimate the true magnitude of the problem.
17002504:10	Ocular lesions can involve all eye tissues, ranging from punctate and sclerosing keratitis (anterior segment) to optic nerve atrophy (posterior segment).
17002504:11	Blindness incidence has recently been shown to be associated with past microfilarial load in individuals followed up within the OCP cohort , confirming the progressive worsening of onchocercal eye disease with parasite exposure.
17002504:12	Conventionally, anterior chamber lesions had been attributed to a cascade of inflammatory processes triggered by filarial products . A novel hypothesis proposes that the proinflammatory events leading to increasing corneal opacity are stimulated not only by the parasite itself, but also by its recently discovered endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria, when released by dying microfilariae . By contrast, the pathogenesis of retinal lesions, which may continue progressing despite parasite clearance after chemotherapy, may result from autoimmune processes elicited by cross-reactivity between the O. volvulus antigen Ov39 and the human retinal antigen hr44 . 
Onchocerciasis also causes troublesome itching and skin changes ranging from early, reactive lesions—acute papular onchodermatitis, chronic papular onchodermatitis, and lichenified onchodermatitis—to late changes such as depigmentation and skin atrophy . When limited to one limb, lichenified onchodermatitis is also called “sowda.”
17002504:13	Despite high skin microfilarial loads in endemic areas, most patients present with subclinical or intermittent dermatitis corresponding to acute papular onchodermatitis, with little cellular attack against live microfilariae (generalized onchocerciasis).
17002504:14	Clinical lesions correspond to infiltrates around dead or degenerating microfilariae surrounded by macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils . As in the cornea, inflammation appears to be largely induced by Wolbachia endobacterial products . In generalized onchocerciasis, the T helper cell type 1– and T helper cell type 2–dependent effector reactions are suppressed by a third arm of the T helper pathway, the T helper cell type 3, or T regulatory cell type 1 . Antigen-specific T regulatory cell type 1 cells constitute a major source of interleukin 10, leading to a downregulation of the immune system that both prevents immune-mediated damage and facilitates parasite survival . By contrast, patients with severe or hyperreactive skin lesions, such as lichenified onchodermatitis or sowda, often present with low microfilarial loads.
17002504:15	Their lesions are due to repeated cycles of inflammation, eosinophil and macrophage infiltration, and destruction of live and dead microfilariae . These different immune responses to the parasite and ensuing clinical presentation may be influenced by host genetic factors . 
Onchocerciasis is also a systemic disease that is associated with musculoskeletal pain, reduced body mass index, and decreased work productivity.
17002504:16	This may be due to the fact that microfilariae can invade many tissues and organs, and be found in blood and urine . Involvement of heavy microfilarial infection is also suspected in the onset of epilepsy  and the hyposexual dwarfism known as Nakalanga syndrome . A direct association between microfilarial load and excess mortality of the human host has been demonstrated recently . 
Epidemiological Patterns 
In contrast with some soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomes, whose worm burdens typically peak in the young, age-specific patterns of O. volvulus infection show strong variation according to locality (microfilarial loads can increase, decrease, or plateau with age), and may differ markedly with host sex.
17002504:17	Age- and sex-specific exposure, endocrine factors, and parasite-induced immunosuppression have been forwarded as possible explanations . These patterns have implications for O.
17002504:18	volvulus population biology and the design of control strategies.
17002504:19	The rationale behind the establishment of the OCP in savannah areas of 11 West African countries was based on the observation that there was a blinding savannah parasite strain, transmitted by savannah members of S. damnosum s.l., and a non-blinding forest strain, transmitted by forest members.
17002504:20	Cross-experimental infections had indicated strong local adaptation and heterologous incompatibility, suggesting that the existence of O. volvulus–S.
17002504:21	damnosum complexes could be responsible for the distinct distribution and severity of onchocercal blindness . DNA-based methods confirmed an association between savannah and forest parasite types with, respectively, severe and mild ocular onchocerciasis . In West African savannah, blindness prevalence correlates positively with intensity of infection in the community, a relationship rarely observed in West African forest . The geographic distribution of severe and mild visual impairment is not, however, neatly confined to the savannah/forest divide.
17002504:22	There are forest and forest–savannah mosaic areas with high blindness prevalence  and parasites distinct from those in West Africa, while in others, parasites genetically indistinguishable from West African savannah isolates are not associated with blindness . The pathogenic differences of the various strains may be a function of their relative Wolbachia load . 
Disease Burden and Socioeconomic Consequences 
The true burden of onchocerciasis has largely been underestimated.
17002504:23	Excess mortality of the blind, particularly among males, may be considerable . Even in sighted individuals, high microfilarial load can negatively affect a host's life expectancy . Parasite-induced immunosuppression to specific and non-specific antigens , impairment of the ability to fend off infections and seroconvert successfully upon vaccinations , and manifestations such as epilepsy possibly due to heavy infection  may be partially responsible for excess mortality.
17002504:24	It is also well known that onchodermatitis and epilepsy are associated with social stigmatization . Onchocerciasis is deemed responsible for the annual loss of approximately 1 million disability-adjusted life-years—healthy life-years lost due to disability and mortality (more than half of them due to skin disease )—which greatly reduces income-generating capacity , incurs significant health expenditures, and exerts, overall, an immensely negative socioeconomic impact on the afflicted populations and their land use .
17002504:25	Although not the only cause of depopulation in some otherwise fertile West African valleys, onchocerciasis prevented resettlement of these arable lands . The benefits accrued through onchocerciasis control programs should be measured not only in terms of blindness cases prevented and the cost-effectiveness of treatment , but also in terms of number of deaths averted.
17002504:26	Onchocerciasis Control Strategies 
The mainstay of onchocerciasis control is through antivectorial and antiparasitic measures.
17002504:27	The former are directed against the black fly aquatic stages, and the latter against the microfilariae.
17002504:28	As yet there is no effective macrofilaricidal drug that is safe for mass treatment.
17002504:29	The OCP initially implemented weekly larviciding of vector breeding grounds, with the aim of interrupting transmission in the core OCP area.
17002504:30	After achieving this, elimination of the parasite required abolishing vector sources for as long as microfilariae remain in human skin.
17002504:31	This duration was deemed to be at least 14 years (considering the life expectancies of both adult worms and microfilariae) . In some parts of the OCP area, children born after the initiation of vector control proved to be uninfected . In 1987, Merck took the unprecedented decision to donate ivermectin (Mectizan), an effective and safe microfilaricide, for as long as necessary to eliminate onchocerciasis as a public health problem.
17002504:32	Following this commitment, regular ivermectin distribution by mobile teams was introduced to complement vector control in some OCP areas, or as the sole intervention in others . Ivermectin, given at the dose of 150 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, acts as a highly effective microfilaricide and inhibits microfilarial production by female worms for several months.
17002504:33	Mass administration of ivermectin (to all those aged five years or older, excluding pregnant women and those breastfeeding a child younger than one week old) once or twice per year reduces morbidity and disability  and lowers transmission . Given the high initial endemicity in some foci, annual regimes are not considered sufficient to achieve local elimination of parasite populations , unless very high therapeutic coverage (more than 80 percent of the total population) is achieved for at least 25 years without loss of treatment efficacy . 
In Latin America, focal vector control was conducted in Guatemala with some degree of success against the local S. ochraceum s.l. vector , but was otherwise considered impractical.
17002504:34	The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA) was initiated in 1993 as a regional partnership to eliminate all morbidity from onchocerciasis (and suppress its transmission wherever possible) in foci of the six affected Latin American countries . OEPA's strategy is currently based on biannual mass ivermectin distribution, as it was considered that treatment every six months would have a greater impact on transmission  and female worm fecundity . 
In 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in order to cover the remaining 19 African countries not protected under the OCP umbrella . (Three of them, Kenya, Rwanda, and Mozambique, were found not to be endemic.)
17002504:35	Since then, APOC's strategy has been based on annual ivermectin distribution.
17002504:36	The levels of geographic (percentage of villages treated in an area) and therapeutic (percentage of population treated in a village) coverage achieved by mobile teams tended to be unsatisfactory, with little prospects of sustainability.
17002504:37	Instead, APOC has implemented, with great success, the modality of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), by which communities themselves appoint accountable local distributors . By the end of 2005, 400 million treatments had been supplied by the Mectizan Donation Program, with an estimated 40 million people living in 90,000 African villages being treated by nearly 300,000 community distributors throughout APOC projects.
17002504:38	The average cost per person treated, including volunteers' time, is US$0.74,
17002504:39	making CDTI highly cost-effective . Besides, the cost per person treated as part of APOC (not including the value of Mectizan) is nearly 8.5 times cheaper than the cost per person protected, via vector control, under the OCP . In addition, the CDTI strategy has empowered communities to such an extent that it is currently being used as a platform for integrating other, mainly chemotherapeutic community-based interventions (such as vitamin A supplementation and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis treatment).
17002504:40	Integration with other control programs may help maintain high coverage levels as clinical symptoms of onchocerciasis subside .
17002504:41	However, in spite of its impressive achievements in terms of coverage, and the promising perspectives of combined community-directed interventions, APOC has to face serious challenges in terms of achieving its ultimate treatment goal of both long-term sustainability and substantial permanent impact.
17002504:42	In those areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis (caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa ) are coendemic (mainly central Africa), ivermectin treatment for O.
17002504:43	volvulus in individuals with high L. loa microfilaraemia can result in severe adverse events, including fatal encephalopathy .
17002504:44	This has represented an important setback to APOC's expansion.
17002504:45	Geostatistical models are being developed to map the risk of heavy loiasis across Africa , and treatment protocols will be tested aimed to reduce L. loa microfilaraemia prior to ivermectin treatment.
17002504:46	Studies aimed at evaluating the sustainability of APOC-sponsored projects have also revealed that communities do not always support distributors adequately; the continued commitment of distributors is often maintained because of their involvement in other more “lucrative” activities, such as immunization.
17002504:47	Lack of resources makes supervision difficult at the community and health facility levels, and many obstacles must yet be overcome to integrate CDTI successfully with other health activities .
17002504:48	These concerns raise questions as to how long APOC should last.
17002504:49	When launched, it was anticipated that APOC's duration would be 12 years (1995 through 2007).
17002504:50	Since then, a two-year phasing-out period has been added, and donors' support secured until 2010.
17002504:51	Presently, no decisions regarding further extensions have been made, but, given the life cycles of the parasite and its vector, APOC's activities would likely need to be sustained for at least 20 years to have a significant and enduring impact . 
Need for Other Effective Compounds against O.
17002504:52	volvulus 
The increasing reliance of onchocerciasis control upon ivermectin alone, and the absence of a real breakthrough in vaccine development , have spurred research on other compounds.
17002504:53	Moxidectin has emerged as a highly efficacious microfilaricide whose half-life in humans is longer than that of ivermectin ; it may therefore suppress adult worm fecundity for longer . Its chemical structure is similar to that of ivermectin, and, in animal models, it does not seem to be truly macrofilaricidal . 
Novel chemotherapeutic interventions could be based on the use of antibiotics against the endosymbiotic bacteria, as long-term depletion of Wolbachia impairs worm reproduction and survival . Daily treatment with 100 milligrams of doxycycline for six weeks (or 200 milligrams daily for four weeks) leads to an interruption of embryogenesis that lasts for 18 months or more .
17002504:54	However, the prolonged duration of treatment, the various contraindications to antibiotics, and the risk of inducing resistance in other pathogens make it difficult to incorporate these regimens in mass chemotherapy programs.
17002504:55	Research on the efficacy of other antibiotics and the shortest course of treatment that can effectively remove the bacteria permanently may help overcome some of these obstacles . Alternatively, anti- Wolbachia therapy could be used to treat selectively those individuals identified as microfilaria-positive at the end of mass ivermectin distribution in order to “mop up” areas where parasite elimination is deemed feasible.
17002504:56	It is to be expected that the scaling up of all ivermectin-reliant control programs (previous OCP countries and those within APOC and OEPA) will impose selection pressures on the parasite genome.
17002504:57	Although no confirmed case of ivermectin resistance has yet been identified, a phenotype of suboptimal response to the drug has been reported in localities in Ghana subjected to more than nine treatments .
17002504:58	This phenomenon appears to be explained not by loss of microfilaricidal efficacy, but by adult females resuming reproductive activity earlier than expected.
17002504:59	Evidence of selection operating upon polymorphic loci (associated with ivermectin resistance in veterinary nematodes) has been documented by genetic analysis of worms obtained from patients who had received six or more annual doses in comparison to those who were ivermectin-naïve .
17002504:60	However, the definitive studies linking response phenotype to parasite genotype with increasing treatment doses have yet to be conducted.
17002504:61	Mathematical models can help understand parasite population biology processes that influence rates of infection recrudescence  and the spread of alleles favored by ivermectin-induced selection.
17002504:62	Modeling for Onchocerciasis Control 
Onchocerciasis is one of the best examples in the history of parasitic control in which intervention strategies have been informed at all stages by computer simulation models.
17002504:63	In particular, ONCHOSIM, a computer program for modeling onchocerciasis transmission and control, was developed under the sponsorship of OCP for West African savannah settings .
17002504:64	Other models pertain to transmission and control in forest areas and Latin American foci . The key question of how long antifilarial treatment should be administered depends on the anticipated goals and the particular epidemiology of specific foci.
17002504:65	If the objective is elimination of onchocerciasis as a public health problem, annual ivermectin administration in APOC countries will constitute a successful strategy once the levels of infection in the community are reduced below five to ten microfilariae per skin snip, but this is unlikely to interrupt transmission of O. volvulus in Africa . Factors such as the intensity and seasonality of transmission, the Onchocerca–Simulium combination(s) present, the parasite distribution among hosts, the density-dependent processes operating upon the parasite's life cycle, and the interaction of all these with control interventions and their coverage will determine the stability of the host–parasite system and our ability (or inability) to push O. volvulus below possible transmission breakpoints [ , ].
17002504:66	Conclusion 
Neglect manifests itself in many guises.
17002504:67	Financial and political commitment are required not only to support the control programs but also to fund the research necessary to provide the tools to enable parasite elimination.
17002504:68	The spectacular success of the OCP has pushed onchocerciasis down to the bottom of the health research agenda at a time when consolidating its achievements and demonstrating long-term success in APOC and OEPA are of utmost importance.
17002504:69	Priority should be given to the development of tools for improved diagnosis (detection of skin microfilariae will lose sensitivity as control progresses, and parasite antigen tests have proved elusive), efficacious killing of adult worms, early detection of potential loss of drug efficacy and associated parasite genetic changes, and better understanding of the impact of chemotherapeutic interventions upon the population biology of O. volvulus .
17002504:70	At present, the prospect of indefinite ivermectin distribution risks the development of anthelmintic resistance and tempts public and donor fatigue.
20644708:0	Introduction 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), comprising over 90% of all pancreatic cancers, remains a lethal disease with an estimated 232,000 new cases, 227,000 deaths per year worldwide, and a less than 5% 5-y survival rate . Currently the standard of care for the 20% of patients with localized disease is surgery followed by chemotherapy, and in some cases radiation.
20644708:1	Unfortunately, despite the use of adjuvant therapy, median survival remains at best 23 mo .
20644708:2	It is important to note, however, that up to 27% of patients with resected PDAC can survive for 5 y – .
20644708:3	However, in studies examining actual long-term survivors – only two have found that adjuvant therapy was associated with improved survival . In addition, randomized controlled trials of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy demonstrate an improvement in median survival of at best 3 mo .
20644708:4	One possible conclusion from these studies is that tumor biology dictates outcome and that our current adjuvant therapy has only a modest impact on altering a patient's course.
20644708:5	Hypothesizing that the dismal outcome of patients with localized disease is due to the presence of micrometastatic disease, current clinical investigation has focused on preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy .
20644708:6	This approach, in which patients who cannot tolerate the stress of therapy or who develop metastatic disease during treatment are spared surgery, has demonstrated an overall survival of 34 mo in this highly selected patient population . Therefore the ability to select patients who would most benefit from a neoadjuvant approach may be important.
20644708:7	One way to select these individuals is to define a prognostic gene signature that can identify patients with more aggressive tumor biology upfront.
20644708:8	Expression profiling of PDAC has lead to further studies of additional molecular diagnostic and prognostic markers – .
20644708:9	However, the search for genes of biological significance in these large datasets continues to be challenging.
20644708:10	One approach to identify genes or pathways that are biologically relevant is to study those that are of prognostic significance . Lowe and colleagues found differential gene expression changes associated with nodal status in primary PDAC suggesting that molecular differences in primary PDAC do exist.
20644708:11	We hypothesized that by comparing primary PDAC tumors at the extremes of disease, we would identify molecular changes reflective of differences in biology within primary PDAC tumors.
20644708:12	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
We profiled and compared nonmetastatic and metastatic primary PDAC tumors and identified a six-gene signature.
20644708:13	Although this signature was not derived on the basis of outcomes, we show that it was prognostic in a true test set of resectable PDAC patients.
20644708:14	Importantly, our six-gene signature was independently predictive of survival, stratifying patients with median survivals of 15 compared to 49 mo, outperforming current pathological staging criteria, suggesting that our signature will be a powerful prognostic tool for patients with localized PDAC.
20644708:15	PDAC continues to be a devastating disease with few long-term survivors.
20644708:16	Surgery remains the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with resectable PDAC . Yet with a median survival only of less than 2 y after surgery, the attendant postoperative mortality rate of 2%–6% , and postoperative complication and hospital readmission rates of 59% , the decision for surgery should be made cautiously.
20644708:17	Therefore, improved patient selection for therapy is necessary.
20644708:18	For the majority of patients who cannot undergo surgery, gemcitabine chemotherapy remains the best option, yet only 5%–10% of patients respond to the treatment . Given the current therapeutic limitations, additional prognostic tools are needed to help a patient decide whether to have surgery, and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or when to consider participation in a clinical trial.
20644708:19	Our analysis identified a surprisingly small number of genes with differential expression between early compared to late stage primary PDAC.
20644708:20	This finding suggests that primary PDAC may be largely homogenous from a global gene expression standpoint.
20644708:21	Nonetheless, the differences that we identified appear to be clinically and therefore biologically important.
20644708:22	Our findings of molecular differences in resected primary PDAC tumors suggest that there is subtle biological variation in these tumors that influences outcome.
20644708:23	A review of previous published studies did not identify differential expression of our six genes , – .
20644708:24	This finding is not surprising, as previous studies examined differential gene expression changes between either normal pancreas or chronic pancreatitis and PDAC – . Only one study has looked at gene expression changes between PDAC of different stages . Ours was the first, to our knowledge, to study molecular differences between nonmetastatic versus metastatic primary tumors and identify and validate a prognostic signature for PDAC.
20644708:25	Of the six genes identified in this study, most do not have an obvious role in carcinogenesis.
20644708:26	Three of the six genes demonstrated significantly higher expression in the poor prognostic groups ( SIGLEC11 KLF6 NFKBIZ ; ).
20644708:27	ATP4A GSG1 and SIGLEC-11 have not been studied in cancer.
20644708:28	SIGLEC-11 is thought to be expressed by tissue macrophages and also the brain microglia . Interestingly, a missense mutation of SIGLEC-11 (S465A) was identified in the mutation discovery screen of the recent genome-wide sequencing of PDAC . NFKBIZ, also called IkappaB zeta, binds to the p50 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and is important for interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction and may be induced by IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptors . Given the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis and high degree of stromal fibrosis, it is possible that NFKBIZ may play a role in PDAC and inflammation.
20644708:29	KLF6 is a transcription factor and its full length transcript is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in prostate, lung, and ovarian carcinogenesis . However a splice variant KLF6-SV1 has been shown to have oncogenic properties.
20644708:30	The oligonucleotide probes used in the Agilent whole human genome array and the antibody against KLF6 did not differentiate between the full-length and splice variant.
20644708:31	In agreement with a previous study we found that KLF6 protein expression was higher in tumors than normal pancreas.
20644708:32	In addition we found that higher KLF6 expression was associated with worse survival.
20644708:33	Hartel et al. further investigated KLF6-SV1 expression in their study using real-time PCR and demonstrated that the higher KLF6 expression seen in tissues was associated with a higher ratio of KLF6-SV1 compared to full-length KLF6.
20644708:34	Therefore our findings that KLF6 expression is higher in tumors and is prognostic is likely in agreement with this study.
20644708:35	Only one patient in the UNC1 cohort was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to 80% of NEB patients who were treated with palliative chemotherapy.
20644708:36	Although there is a possibility that our signature may be reflective of gemcitabine treatment or perhaps resistance, as NEB patients died of metastatic disease despite gemcitabine treatment, the successful application of our six-gene signature on an independent test set of patients where only 3% of patients with localized PDAC were treated with neoadjuvant therapy suggests that it is a rigorous predictor of prognosis in previously untreated patients.
20644708:37	We found no association between our six-gene signature and whether a patient received adjuvant chemotherapy.
20644708:38	In addition, chemotherapy treatment in this cohort, either pre- or postoperative, did not demonstrate a survival advantage.
20644708:39	Another concern is the validity of our hypothesis that gene expression changes at different stages of primary PDAC development may occur and be important for prognosis.
20644708:40	Our study is in agreement with Lowe and colleagues' findings that differential gene expression changes can be identified within primary PDAC .
20644708:41	However, they did not address the prognostic value of their findings.
20644708:42	Several studies have also suggested that gene expression changes in metastasis may be found in primary tumors.
20644708:43	In a study of molecular differences between primary tumors and metastases, Golub and colleagues identified a gene expression signature of metastasis present that could be identified in primary tumors . In addition, studies in melanoma have suggested that metastatic cells may be found in the parent primary tumor . Finally studies in breast cancer have demonstrated that gene expression changes found in breast cancer cells with metastatic potential may be prognostic and predictive of patients who will develop metastasis – . Our study is the first to demonstrate that molecular differences in metastatic PDAC can be identified at earlier stages, and that these differences are predictive of future behavior.
20644708:44	Whether these molecular changes are biologically associated with metastatic potential will require further investigation.
20644708:45	We have applied our six-gene signature to an independent dataset of 67 patients, and have validated its prognostic value.
20644708:46	In addition, we have validated the protein expression of KLF6 in a 50-patient TMA.
20644708:47	Although not nearly as powerful a predictor of prognosis as our six-gene signature, we found that KLF6 expression was prognostic in our 50-patient TMA.
20644708:48	Further validation studies will be needed to see if KLF6 alone may be a useful prognostic marker as others have shown . Our findings suggest that the prognostic value of KLF6 is strengthened in evaluating the six genes in their entirety.
20644708:49	Studies of patients with resectable PDAC demonstrate median survivals of up to 22 mo, equivalent to the median survival of patients in our training and testing cohorts , . Our finding that our six-gene signature is able to stratify patients, with startling differences in survival, suggests that it may be used to select patients for therapies.
20644708:50	For example, for patients who are at high operative risk, knowledge of a median survival of 49 compared to 15 mo, may be helpful in the operative decision-making process.
20644708:51	Similarly, patients who have a poor prognosis based on the six-gene signature may be considered for neoadjuvant therapy.
20644708:52	Currently, the minority of centers use neoadjuvant therapy as a standard of care, most instead reserve this for patients with locally advanced unresectable or borderline resectable tumors.
20644708:53	Therefore the current decision-making process is based on anatomical considerations.
20644708:54	Our prognostic signature may refine this paradigm such that neoadjuvant therapy is offered to patients on the basis of biological considerations, regardless of resectability, and may allow us to further study and maximize the benefits of neoadjuvant treatment.
20644708:55	In addition, as new therapies are developed, it may help to determine whether patients may require more or less aggressive treatment.
20644708:56	Finally, our findings that there are molecular differences associated with late-stage primary tumors, which translate into differences in prognosis, suggest that the six genes in this signature should be further studied for their potential as biomarkers, and some of these genes, or the pathways that they fall into, may represent new therapeutic targets.
11996687:0	Serotypes 
Typical and atypical EPEC strains belong to two different sets of serotypes.
11996687:1	This table was constructed on the basis of similar studies carried out in São Paulo ( – ) and the United Kingdom and on a smaller scale in Rio de Janeiro and Italy . Most of the typical strains were isolated in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and most of the atypical ones in United Kingdom and in Italy.
11996687:2	The serotypes isolated in São Paulo include motile and nonmotile strains (indicated by placing the H antigen in brackets).
11996687:3	The H antigens of these nonmotile strains were inferred by restriction analysis of the fliC genes (B.A.
11996687:4	Botelho, et al., unpub. data).
11996687:5	These serotypes may include both motile and nonmotile variants.
11996687:6	Most of the serotypes in may easily be classified as typical or atypical.
11996687:7	However, some serotypes are not so readily classified, mainly those that include Stx-producing strains, of which the most frequent are serotypes O26:H- and H11, and O111ac:[H8] (considered by some authors as EHEC or STEC) . In fact, these serotypes and others with properties similar to those of O128:H2 are not true atypical EPEC or STEC serotypes but rather are heterogeneous serotypes that include different clones or genetic lineages.
11996687:8	For example, we have recently shown by random amplified polymorphic DNA that O26:H11 Stx-producing strains isolated in Europe and North America are genetically different from Stx-negative strains of the same serotype isolated in Brazil .
11996687:9	Although this kind of study has not been done with serotype O128:H2, this serotype is also heterogeneous since it includes different ribotypes with distinct virulence characteristics (L.R.
11996687:10	Trabulsi et al., unpub. data).
11996687:11	Certain Stx-producing clones have an irregular geographic distribution and so may be found in some countries but not in others.
11996687:12	Other characteristics that may complicate distinguishing typical from atypical EPEC are related to the EAF plasmid markers.
11996687:13	For example, serotypes O119:H2 and O128:H2 react with the bfpA probe but do not have a true EAF plasmid.
11996687:14	These serotypes have a 100-MDa plasmid that does not contain the bfp operon and consequently does not produce BFP . In contrast, some O142:H6 strains do not react with the EAF probe but produce BFP and show a typical localized adherence (LA) pattern.
11996687:15	These strains may have an EAF plasmid with a defect in the EAF region that does not interfere with the the plasmid’s functions.
11996687:16	Perhaps the best distinguishing characteristic for typical and atypical EPEC serotypes would be production or nonproduction of BFP.
11996687:17	Virulence Characteristics 
In general, typical EPEC strains are more homogeneous in their virulence characteristics than the atypical ones.
11996687:18	With few exceptions, typical strains produce only the virulence factors encoded by the LEE region and the EAF plasmid.
11996687:19	The exceptions are the production of the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) by all O86:H34 strains (L.R.
11996687:20	Trabulsi et al., unpub. data) and the production of the enteroaggregative heat stable toxin (EAST1) by some strains of serotypes O55:H6 and O127:H6 (T.A.T.Gomez et al., unpub. data) that are potential virulence factors.
11996687:21	In contrast, atypical EPEC strains frequently express EAST1 and other potential virulence factors not encoded in the LEE region.
11996687:22	Accordingly, there are two kinds of atypical EPEC strains: those that express only the LEE-encoded virulence factors and those that express both LEE and the non-LEE encoded virulence factors.
11996687:23	Usually both kinds of strains belong to a single clone ( , ).
11996687:24	All atypical EPEC serotypes, with exception of O125ac:H6, include both kinds of strains.
11996687:25	All strains of this serotype examined thus far show the aggregative adherence pattern and the LEE region.
11996687:26	The occurrence of more than one kind of strain in most atypical serotypes is another interesting difference between typical and atypical EPEC.
11996687:27	Typical and atypical EPEC strains also differ in adherence patterns.
11996687:28	The typical strains show only the LA pattern, while atypical strains may show the LAL (localized-like adherence) pattern the DA (diffuse adherence) pattern, or the AA (aggregative adherence) pattern.
11996687:29	The LAL pattern is characteristic of the strains of most serotypes and is mediated mainly by intimin . The DA pattern is mediated by the Afa adhesin (R.
11996687:30	Keller et al., unpub. data), and the AA is mediated by an aggregative adhesin.
11996687:31	The cdt gene of serotype O86:H34 (L.R.
11996687:32	Trabulsi et al., unpub. data) and the afa gene of serotype O55:H7 are located on the bacterial chromosome (R.
11996687:33	Keller et al., unpub. data).
11996687:34	Typical and atypical EPEC also have some interesting differences with regard to the intimin types.
11996687:35	Genetic Relationships 
To investigate the genetic relationships between typical and atypical EPEC strains, we used random amplified polymorphic DNA to study our collection of strains, which includes most of the serotypes shown in .
11996687:36	The dendrogram derived from these data shows that most typical and atypical strains belong to different genetic groups and that the atypical strains are closer to the serotype O157:H7 strains (STEC), which were included in the study for comparison purposes (S.Y.Bando et al., unpub. data).
11996687:37	The only exceptions were the typical and atypical H2 strains that did not separate and formed a subgroup in the atypical/STEC group.
11996687:38	The overall results of this study resemble those reported by Whittam et al. who used multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to study a similar collection of strains and distinguished four genetic groups: EPEC 1 (H6/H34 strains), EPEC 2 (H2 strains), EHEC 1 (O55:H7 and O157:H7 strains), and EHEC 2 (O26:H11 and O111ac:H- strains).
11996687:39	The EPEC 2 group was also closer to the EHEC groups.
11996687:40	For this article, we have not used the division of EPEC into EPEC 1 and EPEC 2, but it may be important in the future.
11996687:41	Several other differences exist between the two clonal groups (R.
11996687:42	Keller et al., unpub. data).
11996687:43	With regard to epidemiology, an EPEC 2 serotype (O111:H2) is strongly associated with nosocomial infection, while an EPEC 1 serotype (O119:H6) is more strongly associated with infection in the community . 
Pathogenicity 
The pathogenicity of most typical EPEC serotypes has been confirmed by volunteer studies . For atypical EPEC we are aware of only one volunteer study, which was performed by Levine et al. with an O128:H2 strain.
11996687:44	This strain was administered in differing doses to 15 adult volunteers, none of whom became ill.
11996687:45	Although this study was carefully conducted, its results are difficult to evaluate because the virulence characteristics of the strain were not known and serotype O128:H2 may include nonvirulent strains . 
	The atypical EPEC strains may be less virulent than the typical ones.
11996687:46	One reason may be the lack of the EAF plasmid; Levine et al. have shown that an O127:H6 strain without plasmid was less virulent for adult volunteers than the wild-type strain.
11996687:47	However, atypical EPEC strains have not been proven to be less pathogenic, and these organisms have other virulence factors that may compensate for the absence of the EAF plasmid.
11996687:48	More studies are necessary to resolve this issue.
11996687:49	Association with Diarrhea 
Typical EPEC serotypes are strongly associated with diarrhea in children <1 year of age.
11996687:50	In this age group, these serotypes have been found to be the main cause of endemic diarrhea in several well-controlled studies carried out in Brazil.
11996687:51	The frequency of typical EPEC serotypes in children >1 year of age is lower and similar to the frequency in controls (2%-4%).
11996687:52	Adult infections are rare and usually associated with other conditions .
11996687:53	The increased resistance in older children and adults may be associated with the development of immunity or the loss of receptors for some specific adhesin . 
Regarding immunity, several studies carried out in Brazil and more recently in Mexico have shown that children develop high levels of antibody against the main EPEC virulence factors.
11996687:54	In addition, the colostrum of mothers living in endemic areas is very rich in immunoglobulin A antibodies against the EPEC virulence factors ( – ).
11996687:55	Much less is known about the association of atypical serotypes with diarrhea, but usually these serotypes are isolated from children with diarrhea who are not carriers of other enteropathogenic agents.
11996687:56	A strong association of atypical EPEC serotypes with endemic diarrhea has not yet been demonstrated.
11996687:57	However, a large outbreak of diarrhea caused by serotype O111:H9 has been described in Finland . 
Prevalence in Developing and Industrialized Countries 
A remarkable epidemiologic difference between typical and atypical EPEC serotypes is their geographic distribution.
11996687:58	Typical EPEC serotypes have traditionally been associated with outbreaks of infantile diarrhea, and, in fact, the first EPEC strains isolated in different countries were of serotypes O55:H6 and O111:H2 . In the past, these epidemic serotypes were frequently identified in industrialized countries as a cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases of diarrhea, but at present they are very rare . In these countries today, serotypes without the EAF plasmid predominate.
11996687:59	In the United Kingdom, for example, EAF-positive strains represent only 10% of all EPEC strains . The situation in developing countries is not well defined, but several studies in Brazil in the 1980s and early 1990s showed a high frequency of typical serotypes.
11996687:60	However, some recent studies have shown a very low frequency of typical EPEC and a relatively high frequency of atypical EPEC (L.C.
11996687:61	Campos, pers.
11996687:62	commun. and unpub.
11996687:63	data).
11996687:64	This finding coincides with a decline in the number of diarrheal cases in several regions in Brazil, suggesting that the changes that have occurred in industrialized countries are likely already under way in Brazil.
11996687:65	The reason for these changes is not clear, but the decline in the frequency of the EAF-positive serotypes that has occurred in Europe and the United States and is beginning to occur in Brazil may be due to improvements in therapy, sanitary conditions, and control of hospital infections.
11996687:66	On the other hand, the emergence and rise in frequency of atypical EPEC strains may have origins similar to those that led to the emergence and increase in frequency of O157:H7 and other STEC serotypes . 
Reservoir 
Typical EPEC serotypes have not been found in animals suggesting that humans are the only living reservoir for these organisms.
11996687:67	In contrast, most atypical EPEC serotypes have been isolated from different animal species.
11996687:68	The association between serotype O26:H11 and calves is well known . Recent studies have emphasized the isolation of Stx-producing strains because of their role in hemolytic uremic syndrome, but eae -positive, Stx-negative strains have been isolated from cattle .
11996687:69	This kind of strain should be considered atypical EPEC.
11996687:70	A similar situation exists in regard to serotype O111ac, and the 69 O111ac strains reported by Ewing et al. in 1963 were all isolated from monkeys . 
Serotype O128:H2 is rather frequent in rabbits and dogs and, like the human strains isolated in Brazil, is EAF negative (Pestana de Castro, pers.
11996687:71	commun.).
11996687:72	In a recent study by Pestana de Castro’s group, serotypes O119:H2 and O111:H25 (an EAF-negative serotype rare in Brazil but frequent in the United Kingdom) were isolated frequently from dogs.
11996687:73	More studies of the prevalence of atypical EPEC serotypes in animals are needed, but available data strongly suggest that the primary reservoir for these organisms is different animal species, as is the case with STEC strains.
11996687:74	Stx-Negative and eae -Positive E. coli Strains in Non-EPEC O Serogroups 
Both stx-negative and eae -positive E. coli strains are found in many non-EPEC O serogroups . We have detected such strains in more than 30 E. coli O serogroups, and a large proportion of strains do not agglutinate in the usual set of E. coli O antisera.
11996687:75	Some strains react with the EAF probe ( eae +, EAF+ strains), but most do not react with this probe ( eae +, EAF- strains).
11996687:76	With a few exceptions, only one or two strains of each of these serotypes have been reported .
11996687:77	The additional virulence characteristics of the eae +, EAF+ strains have not been studied, but recently we investigated the virulence profile of 49 different eae +, EAF- strains isolated from children with diarrhea in São Paulo.
11996687:78	The profile was similar to that of atypical EPEC: many strains were EAST1+ and E-hly +, and a few expressed either the AA or the DA adherence pattern.
11996687:79	Some strains had the gamma intimin sequence, and in many of the strains the intimin type could not be identified.
11996687:80	Some of these strains do correspond to typical or atypical EPEC, and more studies are necessary to establish a precise concept for them, especially for the EAF-negative strains.
11996687:81	Some are likely STEC strains that have lost the stx genes; we cannot exclude the possibility that the DA and AA strains are not true EAEC or DAEC that have received the LEE pathogenicity island by horizontal transfer.
11996687:82	The situation is quite different for atypical EPEC, since a larger number of strains have been studied and most of them belong to well-characterized serotypes.
11996687:83	The role played by these EAF+ and EAF- strains outside the EPEC serogroups in endemic diarrhea has not been established.
11996687:84	In general, the strains are rarely isolated from diarrheal cases and controls, and the global difference is not statically significant.
11996687:85	However, some eae +, EAF+ serotypes as well as some eae +, EAF- strains with specific virulence profiles seem to be associated with endemic diarrhea ( , ).
11996687:86	With regard to outbreaks, an eae +, EAF- serotype (O39:H-) was responsible for a foodborne diarrheal outbreak in 1991, involving 100 adults in Minnesota . 
Conclusion 
Typical and atypical EPEC seem to constitute two groups of distinct organisms that have in common the LEE pathogenicity island.
11996687:87	Atypical EPEC are closer to STEC in genetic characteristics, serotypes, production of toxins, reservoir, and other epidemiologic aspects.
11996687:88	As STEC, they resemble emerging pathogens.
11996687:89	In industrialized countries, they have become a more frequent cause of diarrhea than typical EPEC, and the same shift may be occurring in Brazil.
11996687:90	A large number of Stx-negative, eae -positive typical and atypical EPEC-like strains outside the EPEC O serogroups, as well as atypical EPEC strains, require further study in regard to their virulence and epidemiologic significance.
20418200:0	Materials and Methods 
Results 
 shows the characteristics of our population of exposed and unexposed workers.
20418200:1	Participants were matched for age and smoking history and therefore did not differ in these characteristics.
20418200:2	The mean age (± SD) for the exposed and unexposed men was 32 ± 8 years (range, 19–45 years for exposed and 19–49 years for unexposed), and mean daily cigarette use was 9 ± 10 cigarettes/day (range: 0–40 cigarettes/day for exposed vs. 0–25 cigarettes/day for unexposed).
20418200:3	Most men in both groups smoked (> 70%) and drank alcohol (> 80%) during the 3 months before semen collection.
20418200:4	Very few men in either group took vitamins (≤ 6%).
20418200:5	Men in the unexposed group reported a longer period of abstinence prior to semen collection compared with the exposed group (mean ± SD, 10 ± 17 vs. 7 ± 5 days; p = 0.2; range, 2–100 vs. 2–30 days), had higher rates of chronic disease (33% vs. 12%; p = 0.04), were somewhat less likely to drink tea regularly ( p = 0.07), and consumed fewer fruits and vegetables ( p = 0.08).
20418200:6	Men in the exposed group were less educated (only 15% had completed high school, compared with 48% in the unexposed group; p = 0.004) and took more hot baths in the 3 months before semen collection compared with unexposed men (64% vs. 36%; p = 0.03).
20418200:7	Only two men reported having been told by a doctor that they had fertility problems; one of these men subsequently fathered a child, whereas the other man did not report fathering any children.
20418200:8	This man was in the unexposed group.
20418200:9	shows summary statistics of the three measures of exposure (passive-air badge monitor, urinary benzene, and urinary E,E-MA).
20418200:10	These measures of exposure were highly correlated among exposed men (Spearman ρ > 0.75; p < 0.001 for each pair).
20418200:11	The median concentration of urinary E,E-MA was used to divide the 33 men of the exposed group into subgroups of 17 men with low exposure and 16 with high exposure (median E,E-MA, 1.9 and 14.4 mg/L, respectively).
20418200:12	Comparison of urinary benzene and air measures confirmed these categories.
20418200:13	For passive-air badge measurements, benzene was not detectable (< 0.2 ppm) among unexposed men, and median concentrations for low-exposed and high-exposed men were 1.0 and 7.7 ppm, respectively.
20418200:14	For urinary benzene, the median concentration was 0.1 μg/L among unexposed men, 4.3 μg/L among low-exposed men, and 52.5 μg/L among high-exposed men.
20418200:15	We analyzed 331,900, 170,934, and 160,935 sperm by FISH in the unexposed, low-exposed, and high-exposed groups, respectively.
20418200:16	shows the median, mean, and range of frequencies of abnormal sperm in our population.
20418200:17	The distributions of aneuploidy frequencies were skewed to the right, with a higher mean than median for most subcategories of aneuploidy.
20418200:18	This is because some anomalies, such as disomy or nullisomy 21, are rare events that occur only in a subgroup.
20418200:19	For example, < 20% of men had at least one sperm with nullisomy 21 among Y-bearing sperm ( percent with anomaly).
20418200:20	We applied adjusted negative binomial regression models to compare the sperm aneuploidy outcomes of exposed men to unexposed men.
20418200:21	Rates of overall hyperhaploidy, hypohaploidy, disomy X, disomy Y, and other anomalies were significantly higher among exposed men than unexposed men (data not shown).
20418200:22	As shown in compared with unexposed men, the incidence rate of hyperhaploidy was 1.6 times higher for men in the low-exposed group ( p = 0.03) and 2.3 times higher for men in the high-exposed group ( p < 0.001) after adjusting for age, smoking, hot baths, tea drinking, fruit and vegetable intake, and history of chronic disease ( p trend across three exposure groups, < 0.001).
20418200:23	This finding was driven by the strong association between benzene exposure and disomy X and to a lesser extent by disomy Y. Low-exposed men had a 2 times higher incidence rate of disomy X sperm and high-exposed men had a 2.8 times higher incidence rate than unexposed men ( p = 0.02 and < 0.001, respectively; p trend = 0.001).
20418200:24	High-exposed men also had a 2.6 times higher rate of disomy Y sperm ( p < 0.001) than unexposed men, whereas low-exposed men did not differ from unexposed men (IRR = 1.1; p = 0.78; p trend = 0.002).
20418200:25	When we compared only the men who were exposed to ≤ 1 ppm of air benzene ( n = 9) with unexposed men, we also observed elevated rates of hyperhaploidy [IRR (95% CI), 1.8 (1.1–3.0)] and disomy X [2.0 (1.1–3.9)].
20418200:26	Adjusted models also showed a strong association between benzene exposure and chromosome 21 nullisomy among Y-bearing sperm, but this may be a spurious finding due to the low number of men with this sperm anomaly (< 20% per exposure group).
20418200:27	illustrates the dose–response relationship between log 10 urinary benzene and log 10 frequency of hyperhaploid sperm per 10,000 sperm with the fitted line from a linear regression (β = 0.12; p = 0.002) for all participants.
20418200:28	We used urinary benzene measurements instead of E,E-MA because E,E-MA was not measured in the urine samples of the unexposed subjects.
20418200:29	The association between urinary benzene and sperm aneuploidy remained significant even upon removal of the most extreme points of urinary benzene concentration and/or frequency of hyperhaploidy (β = 0.11; p = 0.002) and even when excluding unexposed men (β = 0.16; p = 0.05), further confirming the dose-related increase in sperm hyperhaploidy.
20418200:30	Discussion 
Results of the present study show that occupational exposures to benzene were associated with increased frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes X, Y, or 21.
20418200:31	Specifically, we found significant exposure-dependent increases in the frequencies of sperm with disomy X, disomy Y, and hyperhaploidy in exposed men.
20418200:32	Men in the low-exposed (median air benzene = 1 ppm) and high-exposed (median air benzene = 7.6 ppm) groups were 1.6 times and 2.3 times, respectively, more likely to have hyperhaploid sperm than unexposed men.
20418200:33	Even the nine men from the low-exposed group who were exposed to ≤ 1 ppm air benzene had statistically significantly elevated rates of hyperhaploidy, specifically disomy X, compared with unexposed men.
20418200:34	Our findings suggest that men occupationally exposed to benzene at air concentrations near the OSHA PEL of 1 ppm produce higher frequencies of aneuploid sperm for the sex chromosomes, and perhaps chromosome 21, than men who were not exposed.
20418200:35	The risk of abnormal reproductive outcomes of paternal origin may be influenced by male reproductive physiology and genetic factors, past and current male environmental exposures, or random mutational errors during sperm production.
20418200:36	Sperm FISH assays have been increasingly employed to identify factors that increase the frequencies of sperm with chromosomal abnormalities.
20418200:37	Elevated frequencies of chromosomally abnormal sperm have been reported for a variety of physiological factors, lifestyle factors, and xenobiotic exposures, including increasing age ( ; ), translocations, smoking, chemotherapeutic drugs ( ; ; ), and various environmental and occupational exposures ( ; ; ; ).
20418200:38	Among occupational exposures, organophosphates, acrylonitrile, and benzene have been shown to increase numerical abnormalities in sperm of exposed men.
20418200:39	One study found an association between paternal occupational exposure to solvents, including benzene, and spontaneous abortion.
20418200:40	Studies have also shown that men with higher frequencies of aneuploid sperm may be at a higher risk of fathering an aneuploid child.
20418200:41	Although there is substantial evidence that exposure to benzene increases chromosomal abnormalities in human lymphocytes after high-dose exposures ( ; ), less is known about the induction of chromosomal abnormalities in the sperm of benzene-exposed men.
20418200:42	To date, four Chinese studies have been published on the effects of benzene exposure on sperm aneuploidy ( ; ; ).
20418200:43	Only one study has investigated associations between benzene exposure and sex chromosome aneuploidy, and none have examined associations with chromosome 21 aneuploidy.
20418200:44	All four studies were limited to small cohorts of men (~ 15) who were exposed to high air concentrations of benzene (> 10 ppm).
20418200:45	Our study is the first to investigate aneuploidy in sperm of workers who were exposed to benzene concentrations relevant to those who are chronically exposed to air concentrations around 1 ppm (the U.S. PEL).
20418200:46	Our study confirms the previously published associations between high benzene exposure and increases in sex chromosome aneuploidy, and more importantly, it extends this association to the low-dose exposure range.
20418200:47	In our study, nine men in the exposed group had air benzene concentrations < 1 ppm (27% of all exposed men).
20418200:48	Two of these men had higher frequencies of hyperhaploidy (36 and 54 hyperhaploid sperm/10,000) than all of the unexposed men (highest frequency, 27 hyperhaploid sperm/10,000).
20418200:49	Our study provides insight into the biological target cells by which benzene causes aneuploidy in human sperm.
20418200:50	Our use of three-color FISH allowed us to compare the frequencies of various disomic and nullisomic sperm within the same samples and to assess whether the disomy and diploidy errors occurred during meiosis I (X-Y-21 and X-Y-21-21) or meiosis II (X-X-21,Y-Y-21, X-X-21-21, Y-Y-21-21).
20418200:51	Our results suggest that benzene may preferentially affect nondisjunction of sex chromosomes rather than chromosome 21 and that meiosis II is more sensitive than meiosis I.
20418200:52	In support of this observation, the frequency of disomy X was highly correlated with the frequency of disomy Y ( r = 0.44, p = 0.004), whereas neither of these meiosis II errors were correlated with X-Y-21 ( r = 0.08, p = 0.61), a type of meiosis I error.
20418200:53	Our data also suggest that high exposures induce both disomy X and Y, whereas it appears that in the low-exposure range, benzene is more likely to induce disomy X with no detectable effects on disomy Y.
20418200:54	This may be due to chromosome-specific susceptibilities to toxin-induced nondisjunction.
20418200:55	Our findings predict that occupational benzene exposures may significantly increase the risks of pregnancies with triple X and XYY syndromes, with lower and only borderline significant predicted risks for offspring with Klinefelter syndrome (XY sperm, IRR = 1.5 and 1.8 for low-exposed and high-exposed, respectively) and Down syndrome (sperm disomy 21, IRR = 2.1 and 1.6 for low-exposed and high-exposed, respectively).
20418200:56	Our results also lend support to the growing evidence that parental exposures to benzene may predispose an offspring to childhood leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
20418200:57	Up to 40% of children with ALL have nonrandom hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes) in leukemic cells, mostly with an excess gain of chromosomes X and 21 compared with other chromosomes.
20418200:58	In addition, this high hyperdiploidy has been shown to occur in utero.
20418200:59	Our study had some limitations in design and analysis.
20418200:60	First, our exposure assessment consisted of monitoring workplace exposure using passive-air monitors and collecting urine samples at only two time points approximately 1 month apart.
20418200:61	Although we lacked exposure information over the entire meiotic period (about 3 months prior to collection), exposure monitoring overlapped with the timing of the two meiotic divisions (about 35 days before semen collection) when aneuploidy would be generated.
20418200:62	Only two men (one unexposed and one low exposed) had worked < 3 months at their jobs (58 and 59 days).
20418200:63	In addition, the strong correlation between the two time points for each measure of exposure provides confidence that we captured the usual workplace exposure of an individual.
20418200:64	Second, we analyzed urine samples for both urinary benzene (all men) and E,E-MA (only in exposed men).
20418200:65	We used E,E-MA to categorize benzene-exposed workers because of the comparatively short half-life of urinary benzene.
20418200:66	However, analyses showed that when we used urinary benzene to categorize low-exposed and high-exposed groups, we obtained similar results (data not shown).
20418200:67	Third, our present study and all previously published studies of sperm aneuploidy in benzene-exposed men were conducted with Chinese cohorts, and the generalizability of our findings will need to be tested in studies of other ethnic groups and in other geographic locations.
20418200:68	Fourth, this occupational cohort may be subject to selection biases including the healthy-worker bias, whereby the individuals who are most susceptible to health effects of benzene exposure may have developed health problems that prevented them from working in the factories from which we recruited, thus underestimating effects.
20418200:69	Conclusions 
We found that benzene was associated with a dose-dependent increase in disomy X, disomy Y, and hyperhaploidy in the sperm of men exposed to benzene.
20418200:70	Our findings of increased hyperhaploidy and disomy X among our low-exposed group (with a median benzene exposure of 1 ppm), as well as among the men in the low-exposed group who had benzene exposure ≤ 1 ppm, suggest that occupational exposure to benzene, even at or below the U.S. PEL, may increase the risks of spontaneous abortions and fathering children with aneuploidy syndromes or birth defects due to paternal aneuploidy.
20418200:71	Given these findings, the current PEL of 1 ppm may not be sufficiently low to protect men from adverse reproductive outcomes that may arise from germline aneuploidy.

21834958:1	Introduction 
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) comprise a group of epithelial cancers that arise from e.g. the lips, the oral or nasal cavity, salivary glands, paranasal sinuses, pharynx or larynx .
21834958:2	With a worldwide incidence of more than 600'000 new cases per year, HNSCC accounts for about 6% of all malignant diseases diagnosed.
21834958:3	If detected early, patients have cure rates of about 90%.
21834958:4	However, 60% of patients present with advanced disease or loco-regional lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis and have a poor prognosis . 
Currently, treatment options for HNSCC patients include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of them . Due to the distinct localization of these tumors in regions with anatomic structures important to e.g. breathing, mastication, swallowing or phonation, invasive treatment regimes frequently leading to severe functional impairments - often accompanied by unfavorable cosmetic outcomes.
21834958:5	This is true despite significant advancements made in the reconstructive abilities over past two decades.
21834958:6	Moreover, radiation may have long-term effects on surrounding healthy structures such as parts of the brain, the spinal cord or salivary glands.
21834958:7	However, while surgery or radiation therapy is local, chemotherapy is applied systemically and may thus result in severe adverse effects e.g. on blood cell production (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombopenia), the mucosa (mucositis), the auditory and vestibular system (ototoxicity) or the kidneys (nephrotoxicity).
21834958:8	Despite this aggressive therapeutic regime, to date many patients with advanced disease cannot be cured and more then half of them die within five years [ - ].
21834958:9	HNSCC is thus currently the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
21834958:10	To overcome at least some of the challenges in the therapy of patients with advanced HNSCC, the application of nanoparticles has been evaluated with regard to their advantages for chemotherapeutic/medicinal, radiation and imaging strategies.
21834958:11	Previous data indicates that cytotoxic drugs such as mitoxantron, cisplatin or paclitaxel as well as the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(meso-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (mTHPP) encapsulated in superparamagnetic, liposome, albumin or methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (MPEG-PLGA) nanoparticles or polymeric micelles not only exhibit potent antitumor activity, but also displayed reduced side effects [ - ].
21834958:12	Furthermore, it has been reported that beta-emitting radionuclides attached to liposomes showed promising results when applied intratumorally and gold nanoparticles or nanoparticles with antisense oligonucleotides against the gene ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) improved radiosensitivity in rodent head and neck cancer models [ - ].
21834958:13	In addition, superior imaging in head and neck cancers resulted from the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles or gadolinium-labelled phosphorescent polymeric nanomicelles [ - ].
21834958:14	In the past years, silica-based nanoparticles have gained increasing interest for medical applications because of their biocompatibility, versatility and stability.
21834958:15	Numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies pointed towards their great potential for improving the efficacy of therapeutic agents in tumor cells by e.g. circumventing solubility and stability problems of certain drugs or enabling targeted delivery and controlled release strategies [ - ].
21834958:16	Moreover, silica nanomaterials have been proposed as promising medical tools for biosensing  and imaging purposes .
21834958:17	However, to our knowledge, silica nanoparticles have not yet been investigated in the context of head and neck cancers.
21834958:18	In this work, we assess the biological in-vitro behaviour of core-shell silica based nanoparticles on the HNSCC cell line UMB-SCC-745 with regard to their cytotoxicity, uptake, localization and intracellular fate.

21834958:21	Results 
Electrophoretic mobility of Ru@SiO 2-OH particles revealed a ζ-potential of -40 mV, which is in good agree, ζ-potentials of +11.3 mV and +4.29 mV have been obtained, respectively.
21834958:22	As a prerequisite for our studies we first determined optimal concentrations of the different surface-modified nanoparticles in our in-vitro model (Figure ).
21834958:23	BrdU proliferation assays indicated for all types of nanoparticles that concentrations ranging between 0.03 - 0.125 mg/ml had no statisticment with the values measured for bare (non doped) SiO 2 nanoparticles, whereas in the case of amino- and PEG-modified particlesally significant effect on cell proliferation compared to untreated controls.
21834958:24	Ru@SiO 2-PEG had no impact on cell growth even at higher concentrations (0.25 - 0.5 mg/ml).
21834958:25	However, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml of Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles negatively affected proliferation rates, leading to an average of 21% and 31% reduced incorporation of BrdU, respectively.
21834958:26	Ru@SiO 2-OH nanoparticles diminished cell proliferation up to 41% at highest nanoparticle concentrations (0.5 mg/ml), while a reduction below 10% was observed at 0.25 mg/ml.
21834958:27	Based on these results we decided to use concentrations of 0.125 mg/ml for all three Ru@SiO 2 nanoparticles for further experiments.
21834958:28	To obtain information about the cellular uptake of Ru@SiO 2-PEG, Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO2-NH 2 we conducted electron microscopic studies in UMB-SCC 745 cells.
21834958:29	Generally, nanoparticle incubation did not result in an obvious ultrastructural damage compared to untreated controls.
21834958:30	Both Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 were detected intracellularly already 30 min after nanoparticle incubation.
21834958:31	In case of single nanoparticles, internalization involved invaginations of the plasma membrane that are lined by electron dense material at the cytoplasmic side.
21834958:32	Furthermore, clusters of nanoparticles were internalized by membrane ruffling (Figure ).
21834958:33	In all cases, nanoparticles were found in membrane-bounded vesicles within the cytoplasm.
21834958:34	Intracellular amounts of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles steadily increased between 30 min and 5 h post incubation (Figure and ).
21834958:35	However after 24 h, large vesicles with many nanoparticles were found in favour of vesicles with single nanoparticles (Figure ).
21834958:36	Despite multiple washing steps during sample preparation for TEM, considerable amounts of nanoparticles were attached to the cell surface at all time points investigated.
21834958:37	In contrast to the other studied nanoparticles, the uptake of Ru@SiO 2-PEG into UMB-SCC 745 cells was minimal (Figure ).
21834958:38	Very few Ru@SiO 2-PEG nanoparticles were observed after 5 h of incubation and then only in a minority of cells.
21834958:39	Neither an increase in uptake over time nor an affinity to the outer cell membrane as with the other nanoparticles could be observed.
21834958:40	These data lead us to exclude Ru@SiO 2-PEG from further experiments.
21834958:41	The uptake of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles had been additionally investigated in a 3D cell culture system (Figure ).
21834958:42	Confocal microscopy revealed that an intense [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2 fluorescence was visible after 5 h in the cytoplasm of cells constituting the outer layer of spheroids while inner cells were devoid of such signals.
21834958:43	With the aim to better characterize the intracellular fate of nanoparticles, immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against markers of endocytotic pathways were performed.
21834958:44	CLSM analyses showed that at all time points investigated immunoreactions for Rab7, GP 120, Mitotracker and Lysotracker were present, but never co-localized with Ru@SiO 2-OH or Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles.
21834958:45	In contrast, a subfraction of EEA1 immunosignals coexisted with Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 fluorescence after 2 h of incubation, reaching a maximum at 5 h (Figure ).
21834958:46	This observation was slightly more pronounced in Ru@SiO 2-OH.
21834958:47	However, the majority of [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2 fluorescent nanoparticles was not located together with EEA1 immunoreactivity.
21834958:48	Co-localization with EEA1 after 24 h of incubation was negligibly low for both nanoparticle types, even if it was slightly higher for Ru@SiO 2-OH.
21834958:49	In addition, we investigated the presence of Ru@SiO 2-OH or Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles over a time span of 15 days (i.e. over five cell passages) in UMB-SCC 745 cells (Figure ).
21834958:50	During the whole experiment no signs of degradation of Ru@SiO 2 nanoparticles could be observed.
21834958:51	During the first two days after Ru@SiO 2-OH or Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 incubation all cells contained large numbers of nanoparticles.
21834958:52	However, at day four, Ru@SiO 2-OH nanoparticles were detected only in about 50% of cells, while Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles were still present in more than 70% of the cell population.
21834958:53	Nine days after incubation, Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles were visible in less then 30% and about 50% of all cells, respectively.
21834958:54	Generally, we found that during mitosis nanoparticles were either only propagated to one daughter cell or distributed between both daughter cells (Figure ).
21834958:55	At day 12 all cells exhibited a cytoplasm free of Ru@SiO 2-OH.
21834958:56	In contrast, Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles were found up to day 15, however, the detectable amounts were low.
21834958:57	4.
21834958:58	Discussion 
The large data corpus of recent years provides evidence that silica nanomaterials may have the potential to strongly improve cancer treatment and diagnosis.
21834958:59	Silica nanomaterials feature the versatility necessary for tumor-specific modifications, stability in the often harsh environments of the body, ease of production and - more importantly - they are generally regarded as biocompatible.
21834958:60	However, the latter clearly depends on many parameters such as particle size, surface modification, dose, exposure time or cell type used as model .
21834958:61	With the aim to explore the suitability of silica nanoparticles for new concepts in the treatment of head and neck cancers we investigated as a first step the biological in-vitro behaviour of non-targeted 200-300 nm core-shell silica nanoparticles with three different surface modifications.
21834958:62	While both Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles displayed high uptake rates in our model, internalization of PEGylated silica nanoparticles was almost completely lacking under the same experimental conditions.
21834958:63	Although we observed this effect in the related HNSCC line UMB-SCC 969 and in the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 as well (unpublished data), other studies showed, in contrast to our results, that PEGylated silica nanoshells are at least able to attach to the outside of MCF-7 cells .
21834958:64	However, PEG is known for its cell-repelling properties [ - ], but uptake efficiency may be increased by the addition of targeting ligands .
21834958:65	Since grafting of nanoparticles with PEG has been reported to be advantageous for in-vivo applications - basically due to its increased half-live in circulation - and helpful for targeting, the generation of optimized Ru@SiO 2-PEG may be worthwhile (work in preparation).
21834958:66	Although the plasma membrane is negatively charged, the different surface charges of (negatively charged) Ru@SiO 2-OH and (positively charged) Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 nanoparticles had no considerable influence on cellular uptake kinetics in our model.
21834958:67	This is in contrast to reports indicating that negatively charged nanomaterials are less effectively internalized .
21834958:68	However, a large number of studies show that both cationic and anionic nanoparticles are capable of effectively passing the cell membrane . 
Our data indicates that at nanoparticle concentrations of 0.125 mg/ml and below, no perturbances in cell cycle progression have been detected under our experimental conditions.
21834958:69	An increase of cancer cell proliferation could be dangerous and hold dire consequences in clinical settings.
21834958:70	This phenomenon has been reported in-vitro for melanoma cells and mesoporous silica nanoparticles , but has never been observed in our experiments.
21834958:71	However, higher concentrations of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 lead to reduced proliferation rates.
21834958:72	While a slowdown in growth of tumor cells may be generally regarded as a positive effect in cancer treatment it should be emphasized that the underlying pathomechanisms in HNSCC are not clear yet.
21834958:73	Previous in-vitro studies in other cancer cell lines have shown that cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles, in relation to size and incubation time, may be due to oxidative stress with lipid peroxidation and membrane damage and/or an inflammatory response . A detailed analysis of the complex molecular pathways involved is therefore needed in order to estimate possible (wanted or unwanted) consequences for future therapeutic strategies.
21834958:74	Because of the different experimental design (e.g. longer incubation times, different particle sizes, other cell lines) it is impossible to directly compare our cytotoxicity data with previous studies.
21834958:75	However, head and neck cancer cells seem to display cell toxic effects at concentrations comparable to other cancer cells, e.g. cervical adenocarcinoma cells , osteosarcoma cells , lung adenocarcinoma cells , and gastric and colon cancer cells . Despite this, nanoparticle concentrations have to be carefully adjusted: using the same nanoparticles and experimental conditions as here, PC-3 human prostate cancer cells displayed a proliferation stagnation of about 15 days after nanoparticle incubation, although metabolic rates have been found to be higher (Besic Gyenge et al., unpublished).
21834958:76	With regard to internalization processes of nanoparticles into cells, phagocytosis, pinocytosis and caveolin- or clathrin-driven endocytosis have all been proposed and seem to strongly depend on particle form, size and cell type used.
21834958:77	With our experimental set-up, apparently two different routes of nanoparticle uptake occur in parallel: on the one hand, single particles enter HNSCC cells via membrane invaginations that ultrastructurally resemble clathrin-coated pits.
21834958:78	The involvement of clathrin-coated pits in internalization mechanisms of silica nanoparticles had also been proposed in several previous in-vitro studies using specific inhibitors or confocal methods [ - ].
21834958:79	On the other hand, the observed bulk internalization of nanoparticles is likely related to non-clathrin mediated endocytosis.
21834958:80	The latter process rather displays features of macropinocytosis, such as membrane ruffling.
21834958:81	Notably, the different surface charges of our nanoparticles did not play an apparent role with regard to the observed uptake mechanisms.
21834958:82	Detailed studies are now needed to further characterize the events taking place at the plasma membrane upon contact with our silica nanoparticles.
21834958:83	However, the incidence of such different simultaneous endocytosis modes of silica nanoparticles is in accordance with a recent paper, where also discrete entry pathways have been observed for single and agglomerated amorphous silica nanoparticles . Furthermore, in mouse melanoma cells, internalization of latex particles of 200 nm (that corresponds approx. to the size of our particles) involved clathrin-coated pits, while latex particles of 500 nm (that corresponds approx. to our nanoparticle clusters) preferentially entered the cells via a clathrin-independent caveolin-associated pathway . 
To characterize the intracellular fate of our silica nanoparticles within HNSCC, we next investigated their possible delivery into early and late endosomes and lysosomes.
21834958:84	The localization of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 in early endosomes indicates their processing to endocytotic pathways, however, a considerable number of particles obviously used a different route of trafficking, that did not involve EEA1-positive organelles.
21834958:85	As long as these organelles have not been characterized, a possible role of nanoparticle's surface charge for endocytic processes cannot be defined.
21834958:86	However, the acidic pH of early endosomes may explain the slightly higher frequency of (negatively charged) Ru@SiO 2-OH in EEA1-containing vesicles.
21834958:87	While we cannot exclude that some Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 may have been shuttled back to the plasma membrane for segregation, the majority of nanoparticles remained intracellularly and accumulated in rather large vesicles 24 h after incubation.
21834958:88	We propose that the latter is related to homotypic vesicle fusion.
21834958:89	No transfer to Golgi apparatus-related pathways has been detected.
21834958:90	More importantly, we found that nanoparticle-bearing vesicles did neither mature from early endosomes into (Rab7-positive) late endosomes nor locate to lysosomes.
21834958:91	While both the known stability of silica-shell nanoparticles and possible cancer-related changes in endosomal sorting mechanisms may have prevented their targeting to degradation pathways, our data is in contrast to other studies showing that silica nanoparticles are in fact transferred to lysosomes [ , ].
21834958:92	Our results also differ from those of Rejman et al.  where a size-dependency of endocytotic pathways had been proposed.
21834958:93	In this study, at least smaller latex particles (200 nm) passaged to late endosomes/lysosomes while only large particles (500 nm) did not .
21834958:94	We therefore conclude that intracellular fate of nanoparticles not only depends on their size (or agglomeration status) but presumably also on cell line.
21834958:95	Although the exact nature of different endocytotic organelles in our model has to await further characterization, the strictly vesicle-associated occurrence of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 in HNSCC may have contributed to their biocompatibility.
21834958:96	In human melanoma cells it had been reported that an escape of silica nanoparticles to the cytoplasm resulted in changes of the cytoskeleton as well as of adhesion and migration properties . Whether the vesicular enclosure of our nanoparticles is a useful feature in the case of intracellular drug delivery strategies in HNSCC remains to be proven.
21834958:97	In addition to their relatively large diameter , the absence of free Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 within the cytoplasm of HNSCC may have been the reason that nanoparticles never passed the nuclear membrane.
21834958:98	Even though localizations of silica nanoparticles within the nucleus had been observed before , our data is in accordance with results from previous studies [ , ].
21834958:99	Recently, it had been shown that labeling with fluorophores may affect uptake kinetics and intracellular pathways of certain probes .
21834958:100	However, due to encapsulation of the dye in our study, it is unlikely that [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2 may have influenced routes of nanoparticles within cells.
21834958:101	Until now, very little is known about the intracellular long-term fate of silica nanoparticles and possible consequences of their persistence in biological systems.
21834958:102	In human lung epithelial cells, Stayton et.
21834958:103	al.
21834958:104	observed a slow but active transfer of silica nanoparticles from the cytoplasm to the exterior environment . They showed that during the first 24 h almost 50% of nanoparticles exited the cells.
21834958:105	In contrast, our data implicates that both internalized Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 remain within the cell and are apparently distributed between daughter cells at cell division.
21834958:106	During the course of several passages, initially high nanoparticle amounts in individual cells become "diluted", but ultrastructurally are still found in vesicles.
21834958:107	The reason for the observed differences in long-time persistence of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 are not clear yet, but may also be related to as yet uncharacterised charge-dependent effects of nanoparticles on endolysosomal pathways.
21834958:108	However, in addition of not featuring acute cell toxic effects, the presence of our silica nanoparticles over 15 days caused no visible changes in viability, proliferation or morphology in HNSCC.
21834958:109	Of note, over the time course studied, ultrastructure of nanoparticles appears to remain unchanged.
21834958:110	However, it cannot be excluded that discrete processes of nanoparticle degradation occurred.
21834958:111	Recently, it had been reported that, depending on functionalization, integrity of silica nanoparticles may be impaired step-wise over time in simulated body fluid with regard to e.g. surface area, pore width or pore volume .
21834958:112	Although the high uptake efficiency of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 in our in-vitro mono-layer model was promising, optimized conditions are needed in case of solid HNSCC tumors where conditions of poorer vascularisation may exist.
21834958:113	Our results in HNSCC spheroids, an established minitumor model, show that penetration depth of Ru@SiO 2-OH and Ru@SiO 2-NH 2 does not reach beyond the first (outer) cell layer - independent of nanoparticle surface charge.
21834958:114	This observation provides further evidence that our nanoparticles are not actively exocytosed.
21834958:115	Stayton et.

Given that nanoparticles are not transported transcellularly and apparently are incapable of passing the intercellular junction complexes, new delivery strategies have to be developed for multicellular poorly vascularized cancers.

21834958:118	Conclusion 
In summary, our study is the first to provide evidence that core-shell silica nanoparticles may be useful tools for the development of novel therapeutic strategies with cancers of the head and neck region.
21834958:119	However, before an encapsulation of pharmaceutical compounds or a functionalization with targeting and imaging moieties may be considered, a better understanding of how these nanoparticles interact with HNSCC cells on contact and after internalization is needed.
21834958:120	Starting from our first steps towards clarification of endocytic pathways, further microscopic, immunocytochemical and molecular biological studies will elucidate nanoparticle sorting as well as their further intracellular fate, including possible degradation processes, or nanoparticle-mediated molecular cell responses.

16083499:0	Background 
Vitamin A-containing cells were first reported in 1982 by Watari et al. in vitamin A loaded mice using fluorescence and electron microscopy .
16083499:1	This cell type was subsequently identified by electron microscopy in normal rat and human pancreatic tissues . These cells were identified as pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) by Apte et al and Bachem et al in 1998 . In the normal pancreas, stellate cells are quiescent and can be identified by the presence of vitamin A-containing lipid droplets in the cytoplasm.
16083499:2	In response to pancreatic injury or inflammation, PSCs are transformed ("activated") from quiescent phenotypes into highly proliferative myofibroblast-like cells which express the cytoskeletal protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and produce type I collagen and other extracellular matrix components.
16083499:3	Many of the morphological and metabolic changes associated with the activation of PSCs in animal models of fibrosis also occur when these cells are cultured on plastic in serum-containing medium.
16083499:4	Activated PSCs have also been implicated in the deposition of extracellular matrix components in pancreatic adenocarcinoma . In patients with pancreatic cancer, an intense, interstitial, fibrillar staining for PSCs is evident in the peritumoral fibrous regions.
16083499:5	Procollagen I staining colocalized with α-SMA to these fibroblast-shaped cells suggests that they are responsible for the deposition of matrix components and the desmoplastic reaction that surrounds the pancreatic tumor . 
Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are key rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of a variety of compounds including PGs, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes.
16083499:6	Two isozymes are found in mammalian tissues, COX-1 and COX-2.
16083499:7	COX-1 is expressed constitutively in a wide variety of tissues, where it is involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.
16083499:8	In contrast, COX-2, which is not expressed in resting cells, is the inducible form of the enzyme responsible for PG production at sites of inflammation.
16083499:9	Growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and other inflammatory mediators can induce COX-2 expression . COX-2 expression and activity is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer, but absent in normal pancreatic acinar and duct cells [ - ].
16083499:10	Some scattered cells in normal pancreatic tissues express COX-2 . 
The current study revealed that COX-2 is expressed in primary cultured PSC.
16083499:11	Furthermore, conditioned media from pancreatic cancer stimulates PSC proliferation and COX-2 expression.
16083499:12	The increase in PSC proliferation in response to conditioned media is prevented by inhibition of COX-2.
16083499:13	Results 
Discussion 
There is accumulating evidence that PSCs play a role in the development of pancreatic fibrosis . Little is known regarding the relationship between PSCs and pancreatic cancer, or the role of COX-2.
16083499:14	The present study revealed that PSCs express COX-2 constitutively and when activated.
16083499:15	The two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, differ in many respects.
16083499:16	COX-1 is a housekeeping gene that is expressed in most tissue, while COX-2 is not detected in most normal tissues.
16083499:17	In the pancreas, islet cells display a strong expression of COX-2 ; however, some scattered basal cells in normal pancreas express COX-2 as well, though less than seen in islet cells . In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which are similar to PSCs, COX-2 expression is virtually undetectable by Western blot analysis in protein extracts obtained from freshly isolated HSC .
16083499:18	However, serum-deprived unstimulated HSC express low levels of the COX-2 protein and expression is dramatically enhanced in response to IL-1α, TNF α or endothelin-1 . The present study suggests that COX-2 expression is independent of the activation status in isolated PSCs.
16083499:19	While there is no marked expression of COX-2 in desmoplastic areas of pancreatic cancers [ - ], it is possible that the enzyme is up-regulated early in the activation of stellate cells in vivo but increased expression may not be required for maintenance of stellate function once activated.
16083499:20	Stimulation of PSC by PANC-1 CM increased the expression of COX-2.
16083499:21	Oncogenes, growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapy and tumor promoters stimulate COX-2 transcription via protein kinase C and RAS-mediated signaling.
16083499:22	Stimulation of either protein kinase C or RAS-mediated signaling enhances mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, which in turn, activates transcription of COX-2 . We have previously reported that PANC-1 CM enhances ERK 1/2 activation and growth of PSCs . We speculate that a growth factor is responsible for these effects, however, our attempts to identify the candidate using receptor antagonists and immunoneutralization have not been successful.
16083499:23	Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 prevented the PANC-1 CM-stimulated increase in PSC COX-2 protein production.
16083499:24	In previous studies U0126 alone had no effect on ERK1/2 or COX-2 expression . This suggests that the MAP kinase pathway plays a role in cancer-induced stimulation of COX-2 in PSCs.
16083499:25	The reported biological consequences of COX-2 up-regulation include growth stimulation inhibition of apoptosis , increased metastatic potential  and promotion of angiogenesis . Increased expression of COX-2 in PSCs by PANC-1 CM may contribute to tumor progression.
16083499:26	Finally, the proliferation of PSCs was inhibited by treatment with NS398, a COX-2 inhibitor.
16083499:27	In pancreatic carcinomas, COX-2 is overexpressed and NS398 inhibits tumor growth [ , ].
16083499:28	This COX-2 inhibitor alone has no effect on expression of COX-2 or ERK1/2 and shows no toxicity at the concentration used in the present studies . Recent studies have demonstrated a role for the COX-2 enzyme and PGE2 in the regulation of epithelial cell growth and angiogenesis [ , ].
16083499:29	These properties will need to be studied further in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and stellate cells.
16083499:30	NS-398 has been previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation of colorectal carcinoma by inducing apoptosis in a COX-2-independent fashion . More studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of inhibition by NS398.
16083499:31	Conclusion 
The COX-2 protein is up-regulated in pancreatic stellate cells by pancreatic cancer-conditioned media.
16083499:32	The induction of COX-2 by pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2).
16083499:33	The COX-2 induction by pancreatic cancer cells is involved in mediating PSC proliferation.
16083499:34	Therefore, COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer and inhibition of this enzyme may prevent or reduce this response.

16699597:0	Introduction 
The study of transcriptional regulatory networks is of central importance to post-genomic research, because every cell is the product of specific programs involving regulated transcription of a large number of genes.
16699597:1	With increasing amounts of data becoming available by advanced data collection and analysis methods, network models have been established in a number of different species . Transcriptional regulatory networks can be depicted as directed graphs, in which transcription factors and their target genes are represented as vertices, whereas the binding of a transcription factor in the regulatory region of a gene is represented as a directed edge.
16699597:2	The transcriptional relationship between several transcription factors and their regulated genes is represented as multi-node subgraphs of the network graph.
16699597:3	Some of the subgraph patterns are immediately biologically meaningful, including the feed-forward loop (FFL), feedback loop (FBL), single input motif (SIM), and multi-input motif  . Such patterns usually exert specific regulatory capacities, for example, a SIM may be used for coordinating a set of genes, whereas a FFL has the potential to provide temporal control of a process .
16699597:4	However, subgraphs do not represent independent units that are functionally separable from the rest of the network.
16699597:5	Subgraphs are likely to aggregate with other subgraphs around some highly connected transcription factors ; an individual transcription factor can thus be a member of many different subgraph patterns with different connectivity.
16699597:6	At the global level, analysis of the network topological organization shows that most target genes are regulated by a small number of factors.
16699597:7	On the other hand, the number of target genes regulated by a given transcription factor is distributed according to power law, indicating that a selected few transcription factors participate in the regulation of a disproportionately large number of target genes . This particular type of well-connected transcription factor has been called a “transcription hub (THub),” and it is usually representative of crucial and essential transcription factors in an organism . 
Transcriptional regulatory networks have evolved to process information such as external nutrients and stress , and the way that the transcription factors in a network perform will necessarily differ extensively.
16699597:8	Analysis of signal transduction in a mammalian cellular network showed that three ligands—glutamate, norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor—make use of different types of sub-patterns at different levels of the network, and at different subgraph densities .
16699597:9	Similarly, different condition-specific sub-networks of the yeast transcriptional regulation network showed different frequencies of various regulatory patterns, and substantial changes in network structure occurred in response to changes in environment and during the development of the organism .
16699597:10	However, so far, very few studies have documented how differences in regulatory motif abundance relate to individual transcription factors on a genome-wide basis.
16699597:11	We have revisited the datasets of Luscombe et al. , in which several transcriptional sub-networks corresponding to particular cellular or environmental conditions (e.g., cell cycle, stress response, etc.) have been identified, and used these data to quantitatively depict the subgraph context in transcription factor downstream cascades.
16699597:12	To this end, we defined the “subgraph preference profile (SPP)” of a transcription factor as the vector of the normalized abundances of a set of basic regulatory subgraph patterns, obtained by counting the weighted census of the regulatory subgraph patterns occurring downstream of the transcription factor.
16699597:13	This set of basic regulatory subgraph patterns contains five 3-vertex patterns and 12 4-vertex patterns.
16699597:14	Based on this definition we studied the relationship between network topology and transcription factor preference profiles, and the dynamic changes in preference profiles occurring among different cellular states or environmental conditions.
16699597:15	An algorithm was developed to analyze systematically the subgraph preferences of transcription factors in a regulatory network.
16699597:16	Because the THubs represent the most influential and essential components in a network , we limited our interest to these crucial transcription factors.
16699597:17	Using this algorithm, we obtained two major results: 1) Certain kinds of regulatory subgraph patterns are preferred by certain THubs in different (sub-)networks, and these preferences cannot be explained by general variations in motif abundance; 2) THubs showed dynamic changes in subgraph preferences when cellular or external conditions varied.
16699597:18	Results 
We have investigated the relationship between the THubs and the normalized abundances (see ) of a subset of regulatory subgraph patterns in yeast transcriptional regulation networks.
16699597:19	We selected the static network, and the cell cycle, sporulation, diauxic shift, DNA damage, and stress response sub-networks from Luscombe et al.  for analysis.
16699597:20	A transcription factor in the static network was regarded as a THub and included in the analysis if it had 39 or more out-degrees; similarly, THubs in the condition-specific sub-networks had five or more out-degrees.
16699597:21	This produced 50 THubs in the static network, and 29–48 THubs in the sub-networks.
16699597:22	Two categories of basic regulatory subgraph patterns were included, the ring and the tree, both with either three or four vertices, thus giving four sets of subgraph patterns.
16699597:23	The normalized abundance of a subgraph pattern was calculated as a weighted census of all occurrences of this pattern in the downstream cascade of a given THub, and the value of this normalized abundance was used to represent the preference of this THub for the subgraph pattern (i.e. subgraph preference).
16699597:24	A regulatory subgraph occurring at a THub with a significantly higher normalized abundance than in the rest of the network, was termed a “preferred” regulatory subgraph pattern of this THub.
16699597:25	The normalized abundances of the entire subset of regulatory patterns constituted the THub SPP.
16699597:26	When, in turn, the preference profiles of all THubs in a network were assembled in a matrix, this formed a “subgraph preference landscape (SPL)” of that particular network.
16699597:27	SPLs were calculated for all six networks and sub-networks.
16699597:28	Similar to what previously has been found in , the analyses of the networks yielded a multi-layered hierarchical cascade structure (see ).
16699597:29	There were 14 layers in the static network, and 13, 14, 9, 9, and 7 layers, in the cell cycle, sporulation, diauxic shift, DNA damage, and stress response condition-specific sub-networks, respectively.
16699597:30	As the SPLs were laid out according to the hierarchical cascades, the common trend for all networks was that the SPPs of THubs in the upper layers were more complex than those of THubs in the lower layers ( A).
16699597:31	In the following sections, we first describe the preference profiles of THubs in the different networks, and we thereafter go on to describe the dynamic characteristics of the THub subgraph profiles between the five condition-specific sub-networks.
16699597:32	Discussion 
Recent cellular network studies have focused either on global topological organization, or on local structure occurrences (for review, see ).
16699597:33	However, investigators need a novel tool to describe the topological and dynamic characteristics of a cellular network that appear between the global and the local level . In this study, we have tried to connect the two opposite poles of cellular network research by investigating the way crucial transcription factors propagate their transcriptional signals to the downstream cascades.
16699597:34	The subgraph patterns of regulatory transcription factors have been reported to form clusters , but how these clusters affect the propagation of transcriptional signals has been poorly understood.
16699597:35	We have developed an approach to count weighted censuses of connected subgraph patterns below these well-connected THubs, which represent the most influential and essential components in a network . 
To our knowledge, our work is the first to quantify the relationship between THubs and their associated regulatory subgraph patterns.
16699597:36	The tendencies we present here have been carefully normalized against biases of the networks, and have been well-controlled against random background.
16699597:37	The results were also strongly robust against several sources of noise, from both the ChIP-chip experimental data and the condition-specific sub-network specification.
16699597:38	No convincing overall associations between subgraph preferences and gene function of biological process could be found.
16699597:39	This could be due to a number of reasons.
16699597:40	One is that the relatively few subgraphs at the 3- and 4-vertex levels will necessarily need to be used for a variety of functions or processes going across the established patterns of gene or process annotation found in established databases.
16699597:41	Another might be that annotations of biological function or process are (statically) linked to genes (THubs or targets), whereas the associations between THubs, subgraphs, and target genes are, as our data indicate, dynamic, varying between different cellular conditions, thus rendering any possible association between subgraph (preference) and biological process very difficult to capture by analysis of present-day databases.
16699597:42	In any case, the analysis of subgraph—transcription factor—target gene relationships may constitute a first small step toward identifying (and possibly annotating) functional and process-related properties of subgraph patterns.
16699597:43	Nonetheless, a number of individual THubs showed high preference for certain regulatory subgraph patterns, hinting at particular downstream cascade characteristics of THub control.
16699597:44	For example, FFLs were preferred by YLR013W (GAT3) in the cell-cycle sub-network.
16699597:45	There are four FFLs immediately downstream of this THub that can be aligned in a symmetrical grid ( A).
16699597:46	Irrespective of whether these FFLs are coherent or incoherent, a highly complex mode of regulation can be generated through this module . Theoretical analysis and experimental evidence suggest that autoregulation and cross-feedback have multiple functions in cell signaling systems . FBLs consisting of three or more factors also enable similar functions in transcriptional regulatory networks . In yeast transcriptional networks, FBLs with more than three regulators are relatively rare, but have been identified in high-throughput ChIP datasets . 
There are only three instances of FBLs in the static network and the cell cycle sub-network, and even fewer in the other sub-networks; it may therefore be argued that the observed high-preference of the pattern could be caused by random fluctuation FBL.
16699597:47	To address this issue, we introduced various kinds of noise to the networks, to tests the robustness on the THub subgraph preferences (see ).
16699597:48	Despite the low number of FBLs in the networks, the preference profiles were fairly stable against random perturbations, possibly owing (at least in part) to the fact that in both the static and cell cycle networks, the FBLs are interlinked in a larger structure ( B), which may have increased the structural stability of the networks.
16699597:49	We therefore see little reason to assume that the THub preferences for FBLs are any less real than for other subgraph patterns.
16699597:50	A FBL-preferring THub, YBR049C (REB1), has been found to perform different biological functions under different conditions.
16699597:51	Under endogenous conditions, it may work as a member of a clock or oscillator structure  to control multi-phase cell processes like cell cycle progression and sporulation.
16699597:52	Under diauxic shift, however, it may work as a member of a switcher , or as a factor speeding up response times under DNA damage and stress response conditions . Non-motif gene circuits have not yet been well-studied .
16699597:53	However, we found that under every condition there were a few THubs that preferred non-motif-like regulatory subgraph patterns, possibly indicating particular features of the signal transduction of these THubs.
16699597:54	In the stress response network, the THub YMR043W (Mcm1) preferred two non-motif regulatory subgraph patterns, regulatory chain and multi-pooling regulation patterns.
16699597:55	Responding to environmental stress, this THub might quickly pass the signal to the every corner of the network through these two patterns.
16699597:56	When the stress is over, this may be sensed by persistent detector FFLs , and the signal can also be broadcasted through the same two non-motif-like regulatory patterns.
16699597:57	SIMs stand out as a peculiar case.
16699597:58	Over-represented in most transcriptional network, SIMs have been regarded as important network building blocks conveying some sort of evolutionary advantage .
16699597:59	However, as SIMs were little, if at all, preferred by individual THubs, our results are unable to support the idea of particular position in the transcriptional network for this motif.
16699597:60	As pointed out by Artzy-Randrup , network design biases, although not favoring any particular motif per se, may still produce an overabundance of particular subgraphs, and the reason for the global overrepresentation of SIMs may thus have to be sought elsewhere.
16699597:61	Gene duplications are common evolutionary events and possibly the most important force driving network enlargement . If gene duplication also includes the upstream control sequence, this will directly create a novel SIM.
16699597:62	Such events are not rare .
16699597:63	Thus, the very mechanism of network expansion (e.g., gene duplication) may be sufficient to cause deviations from a true random network (i.e. overabundance of SIMs) without active selection for a particular motif per se (although it cannot be ruled out that gene duplication itself may be under positive selection).
16699597:64	In this respect, the observed THub subgraph preferences may actually be seen as evidence in favor of an evolutionary explanation for the non-random distribution of subgraph motifs in transcriptional networks.
16699597:65	Whereas it may be conceivable (although debatable ) that over-abundance of subgraphs in the biological networks may have other explanations than evolutionary selection , it seems utterly unlikely that there should at the same time exist some (non-evolutionary) network design “rule” able to account for individual transcription factors selectively accumulating one or the other subgraph motif, in particular, as this seems to occur independently of the overall network accumulation of motifs.
16699597:66	Distinguishing clearly between truly dynamic features and random fluctuations of a network remains a challenge.
16699597:67	The SPL combines information on global topological organization with the connective structure of the network and relative abundances of local subgraphs, data which are all proven powerful tools for annotating gene expression data , inferring network mechanisms , and classifying networks into families . The figurative representation of SPLs (e.g., ) is also a visualization of the inner structures of a regulatory network which could be used to obtain a clearer picture of network activity.
16699597:68	This method for network subgraph analysis might also be applied to other biological or non-biological networks, such as metabolic networks, neuronal circuits, or electronic chips.
17570743:0	Competing Interests 
From its very first issue, PLoS Medicine asked all authors to declare any competing interests, which we placed prominently alongside the authors' biographical information.
17570743:1	Initially we allowed authors to acknowledge their funding sources at the end of the article.
17570743:2	This policy meant that some authors would declare that “no competing interests exist,” and yet in the funding statement at the end of their article would state that they had received funding from pharmaceutical companies.
17570743:3	We presented examples of such cases to the committee, which was unanimous in believing that authors are poor judges of what constitutes a competing interest and that we should revise our policy.
17570743:4	We therefore implemented the committee's recommendations to: (1) make sure that competing interests and funding sources were declared together at the beginning of every article, and (2) ask authors to state what role the funder played in the submission and preparation of the article.
17570743:5	Our policy regarding articles submitted spontaneously (rather than commissioned) for the Magazine section goes even further.
17570743:6	If authors proposing a topic have competing interests that could reasonably be perceived as affecting their ability to write an objective Magazine piece, we will decline their article.
17570743:7	We were also concerned that some of our research papers had the potential to be “spun” favorably by drug companies, since these papers showed the benefit of a particular blockbuster drug.
17570743:8	In all cases, we as editors—together with the academic editor and independent peer reviewers—were convinced that the studies were rigorous and should be published, but we wondered, “What can we do to reduce the risk of the results being ‘spun’?”
17570743:9	The committee's overall opinion was reflected by one member, who wrote: “If you think the article is sound enough to publish, you should publish it.
17570743:10	You can't control the spin, but you can make sure that full information (on author connections, financial ties, etc) is available in the press release.
17570743:11	Hopefully, this will prompt journalists to ask relevant questions.”
17570743:12	In response to this advice, we have—where appropriate—added information about authors' competing interests within the press release.
17570743:13	Unfortunately, research on media reports about blockbuster drugs has shown that journalists do poorly at reporting authors' competing interests . And so even if we add these interests to our press releases we recognize that journalists may not report them, but we will continue to encourage transparency as best as we can.
17570743:14	Preserving Patient Anonymity 
PLoS Medicine adheres to the principle that a case report that arises from the confidential doctor–patient relationship cannot be published unless the patient (or family) has given written consent.
17570743:15	But sometimes authors say that they are simply unable to obtain consent (for example, the patient has moved to a different country) and they offer to anonymize the report.
17570743:16	If there are educational benefits in publishing such a report, and these benefits outweigh the risks of harm (for example, patients identify themselves and feel that their privacy has been violated), would it be ethically acceptable to publish the report without patient consent?
17570743:17	This question arose when we were approached by a legal organization that has amassed a wealth of illuminating medico-legal cases that could potentially educate doctors on how to stay out of court.
17570743:18	Many of the cases involve patients who were harmed or died as a result of medical errors.
17570743:19	We asked the organization if it had obtained consent from the patient or relatives to publish case details.
17570743:20	It had not—but the organization promised to anonymize all patient details.
17570743:21	“We feel the benefits of educating doctors about medical error outweigh any ethical concerns about the invasion of an individual's privacy,” wrote a representative of the organization.
17570743:22	“We take great care to anonymise the cases in such a way that we feel it is extremely unlikely that anyone could be identified by the narrative.”
17570743:23	Our advisory committee was unanimous in believing that anonymization would not be sufficient to protect patient anonymity.
17570743:24	As one committee member said, we could never be sure that the organization had done a thorough enough job of the anonymization process, and therefore, “we should assume there is a chance that the patient's privacy will be violated,” with a risk of causing harm.
17570743:25	As a result of the committee's advice, we declined to publish these medico-legal cases.
17570743:26	Several of the questions that we put to the committee were related to the ethics of publishing “stock” photos of patients (these usually come from news agencies) in Magazine articles when we did not have the patient's written consent.
17570743:27	Most medical journals get around this problem by adopting a position of “assumed consent.”
17570743:28	The BMJ for example, justifies publishing such photos as follows: “We believe that the BMJ would be at a disadvantage among other media if we didn't use such images, and pictures can often tell a story more powerfully than words.
17570743:29	But we cannot take responsibility for the consent of people who are shown in pictures that we have obtained from agencies, libraries, other publications, and other commercial sources…we assume that they and their photographers have obtained relevant permission from models in any images showing people” . We asked our committee: should PLoS Medicine also assume consent to use photos of patients from news agencies in our Magazine articles?
17570743:30	The committee's deliberations centered on a crucial difference between the BMJ and PLoS Medicine . Unlike the BMJ we publish all materials under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which allows anyone to reuse the materials for any legal purpose.
17570743:31	While the patients in the photos might have given consent to the news agency for their photo to be taken (and this is only an assumption), they certainly did not consent to the Creative Commons licensing agreement.
17570743:32	And so the committee felt strongly that we should not use such photos, a position we have adopted.
17570743:33	Is a Program Description a Research Paper?
17570743:34	The most recent—and most contentious—ethical dilemma that we have faced concerned a paper that fell in the grey area between research and a programmatic description.
17570743:35	The authors wished to describe their experience of delivering an innovative health care program under extremely difficult conditions.
17570743:36	The authors made no mention of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, and so we asked the committee whether it considered this sort of paper as a “study” that required prior IRB approval.
17570743:37	The committee was divided on this question.
17570743:38	Some committee members felt that describing a health intervention in order to educate readers does not constitute research and so does not need IRB approval.
17570743:39	“We don't hold educational programs to this standard, nor do we hold government programs,” wrote one committee member, adding that “this seems to be to be a serious case of IRB creep” and suggesting that we were on a slippery slope to requiring “IRB approval even to publish a poem.”
17570743:40	But other members felt strongly that as soon as an author is using patient data, there is a requirement for IRB approval.
17570743:41	One member wrote that publishing a program description is “analogous to secondary data analyses—where data are collected from individuals for one purpose, but then used by researchers for another.
17570743:42	In this case, it is still necessary to safeguard the individuals who provide the data.”
17570743:43	Given the array of differing opinions from the committee, in the first instance we asked for some additional clarifications from the authors as to: (1) whether they sought IRB approval; (2) if they did not seek such approval, what was their rationale; and (3) whether in fact an IRB had confirmed that no approval was necessary for a programmatic description.
17570743:44	The authors explained that they had not sought prior IRB approval because they considered the paper to be “purely descriptive: no hypotheses have been tested; no specific data collection or analyses have been performed for research purposes, nor have any interviews or surveys been undertaken.”
17570743:45	All the data in their paper, they said, “are derived from routine programme reporting and come from patient files completed by the doctor at the time of consultation.”
17570743:46	In response to our queries, the authors also asked their IRB to consider the question of whether this paper constituted research and, as such, whether it required post hoc ethical approval.
17570743:47	The IRB wrote: “The contents of this paper are retrospective and descriptive and do not qualify as research as per the commonly understood meaning of this term.”
17570743:48	We were satisfied by these clarifications from the authors and their IRB, and we plan to publish the paper.
17570743:49	We have asked the authors to include a discussion of these ethical issues within the paper itself.
17570743:50	Conclusion 
We believe that the external advisory committee has provided a valuable service, guiding, educating, and helping us to set policies that we hope have made the journal more “ethically robust.”
17570743:51	We have particularly valued the fact that the different committee members bring such a diversity of views, and that the committee is able to give very rapid advice.
17570743:52	We would like to thank the committee members, who are listed in Table S2 of reference , and we look forward to our ongoing collaboration.
18043740:0	Introduction 
The ubiquitous ‘night shift’ of modern 24-hour society is a challenge to our biological propensity for daytime wakefulness and nighttime sleep.
18043740:1	The ensuing misalignment between the circadian timing system and the sleep-wake schedule during night work impairs many waking functions . Because the deterioration in cognitive functioning at the circadian nadir worsens as sleep pressure increases , individuals are most vulnerable to its consequences after extended wakefulness . The first night in a sequence of night shifts typically preceded by ∼16 hours of wakefulness provides such a situation . Unfortunately this window of vulnerability has been somewhat neglected in research and by policy makers, even though 3.2% (∼864000) of full time wage and salary earners in the United States work the night shift with a significant number of those earners presumably in transition from a day to night shift at any given time.
18043740:2	While a prophylactic nap can ameliorate effects of extended wakefulness in the real world many shift workers are either unable or choose not to nap.
18043740:3	Moreover, operational needs sometimes require workers to be scheduled for a ‘quick comeback’ where they work the day followed by a night shift with only an 8 hour break in between, leaving little opportunity for sleep.
18043740:4	In such circumstances, workers could be awake for 24 consecutive hours by the end of the first night shift a duration of wakefulness associated with increased risk of errors, accidents and injuries comparable to those associated with alcohol intoxication – . 
We investigated nighttime impairment in attention, a diverse psychological phenomenon – which includes selective attention (the ability to process relevant information to the exclusion of irrelevant information ) and vigilance (the ability to sustain focus for an extended period of time ).
18043740:5	Nighttime deficits in selective attention are less well understood than nighttime deficits in vigilance – although both could affect safety and productivity in the workplace.
18043740:6	In fact, our ability to ignore irrelevant or distracting items is vital for effective performance in many critical round the clock operations such as baggage screening at airports, power plant maintenance and air traffic control.
18043740:7	In this study, we measured selective attention with two visual search tasks , assessed vigilant attention with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) (detailed in ) and subjective alertness with a visual analog scale.
18043740:8	Visual search requires subjects to find a target item in a display cluttered with distractor items.
18043740:9	By varying the total number of items presented (set size), we can decompose response time (RT) into two separate components reflecting attentional and non-attentional stages of processing (see Selective Attention below) . While previous sleep deprivation protocols have employed other variants of the visual search paradigm, they did not vary set size, making it difficult to separate effects on selective attention per se from general response slowing – .
18043740:10	One study which did vary set size reported a type of speed-error trade-off in visual search: sleepy subjects tended to engage in faster but less accurate search . To understand the implications of this impairment in the context of shift work, we included a similar visual search paradigm in our protocol.
18043740:11	Deficits in attentional tasks can occur in the early preattentive stage and/or the later selective attentional stage of the task . Because the difficulty level of the visual search task influences the relative contribution of these two stages of processing, we employed two different visual search tasks, an easy conjunction search task and a more difficult spatial configuration search task in order to better determine where deficits in processing occur.
18043740:12	The PVT requires subjects to monitor a source of information over time, for the occurrence of an infrequent, unpredictable stimulus . Changes in the PVT RT of sleepy subjects are considered to reflect lapsing a heightened tendency for microsleep which can lead to missed stimuli or extremely slow responses, and cognitive slowing the overall increase in response latencies . The visual analog scale required subjects to rate their level of alertness on a 100 mm line labeled at end with the endpoints of the alertness dimension labeled as ‘sleepy’ and ‘alert’.
18043740:13	Our protocol included four day shifts (07:00 to 15:00) followed by three night shifts (23:00 to 07:00) .
18043740:14	After the final day shift, the subjects were scheduled to sleep that night at their usual time, had a free day, and then began the first night shift 32 hours after the end of the last day shift.
18043740:15	On the day shifts subjects slept at night.
18043740:16	During the night shift part of the study, each subject was randomly assigned to one of two sleep schedules, either 08:00-16:00 or 14:00 to 22:00 . We found that the nighttime loss of alertness was accompanied by a slowing of response and decline in accuracy due to loss of sensitivity and increased lapsing, both of which were most acute on the first night shift.
18043740:17	Results 
Discussion 
We found a nighttime loss of alertness accompanied by a slowing of response, a decline in accuracy due to loss of sensitivity and increased lapsing  . These nocturnal deficits provide some insight into why occupational errors, accidents and injuries are highly prevalent in overnight operations.
18043740:18	Our most significant findings pertain to nighttime impairment in selective attention and to those nocturnal deficits in attention and alertness that were most pronounced on the first night shift.
18043740:19	We found that on the night shifts, subjects responded more slowly and less accurately than they did on day shifts even though they searched faster—they spent less time attending to each item.
18043740:20	More significantly, the nocturnal decline in search accuracy (d′) was most acute on the first night shift, albeit only in the more challenging task.
18043740:21	To our knowledge this is the first detailed examination of the impact of night work on selective attention using the visual search paradigm.
18043740:22	The acute loss of accuracy (d′) on the first night shift was accompanied by a pronounced increase in attentional lapses and a decline in alertness, which points to the detrimental impact the first night of work can have on safety and productivity in the workplace.
20492639:0	Background 
Legionellosis is caused by exposure to the small intracellular gram-negative bacterium Legionella from water sources in the indoor or outdoor environment . Two to fifteen percent of all hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonias in Europe and North America are caused by Legionella and recent studies suggest that rates of legionellosis may be increasing . The optimal antibiotic treatment of legionellosis has never been investigated in a randomized clinical trial, but most clinicians use either macrolides or fluoroquinolones  alone or combined with rifampicin . 
The most common presentation of legionellosis is pneumonia which is often severe but almost any manifestation of the disease has been seen ranging from a mild self-limiting flu-like illness called Pontiac fever to any extrapulmonary affection to multi organ failure and death.
20492639:1	Although no single finding in legionellosis is pathognomonic several findings are characteristic  such as relative bradycardia, hyponatriemia, elevation in serum creatinine kinase, diarrhea, confusion and impaired liver- and kidney-function [ - ].
20492639:2	Prognostic factors in legionellosis are not well described but delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy has been associated with increased mortality .
20492639:3	Other potential prognostic factors include: Delayed hospitalization, long duration of symptoms prior to ICU admission, high SAPS II or APACHE II score, and hyponatriemia [ - ].
20492639:4	Most previous studies were small and did not analyze prognostic factors according to whether legionellosis was community- or hospital-acquired [ - ].
20492639:5	We designed a 10-year population-based historical cohort study in four Danish counties with the following aims: 1) To evaluate differences between community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases of legionellosis [CAL and HAL]; 2) To compare 30- and 90-day case fatality for patients with CAL and HAL; 3) To assess predictors of 30-day mortality for these 2 forms of legionellosis.
20492639:6	A better understanding of clinical presentation and prognostic factors for legionellosis may optimize our therapeutic approach and management of legionellosis, and thus reduce mortality and morbidity.
20492639:7	Methods 
Results 
We identified 370 cases of legionellosis, 22 cases who were never admitted to hospital and 16 cases with missing medical records were excluded.
20492639:8	Of the 332 cases eligible for analysis 272 (81.9%) were community-acquired and 60 (18.1%) were hospital-acquired.
20492639:9	For CAL 241 (88.6%) were reported to the Danish surveillance system whereas 57 cases of HAL (95%) were reported (p = 0.14).
20492639:10	More cases of CAL (87.5%) were classified as definitive compared to HAL (80.0%) (p = 0.05).
20492639:11	Discussion 
In this historical population-based cohort study we found that HAL had a less distinctive clinical presentation and was associated with fewer abnormal biochemistry findings than CAL.
20492639:12	Time from in-hospital symptoms to diagnosis was longer for HAL than for CAL, indicating a need for increased awareness of HAL.
20492639:13	Legionellosis was associated with high mortality, particularly among hospital-acquired cases.
20492639:14	Independent risk factors of death among community-acquired cases were age, comorbid conditions, lymphocytosis, and hyperbilirubinemia.
20492639:15	Omission or delay of anti-legionella treatment was a risk factor for death among patients with CAL.
20492639:16	The strengths of our study include the population-based design, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis in all cases, and a systematic review of patients' medical records.
20492639:17	In Denmark there is equal access to a public health care system and reliable information on patients' date of death is available from the Central Person Registry.
20492639:18	Our study also had several limitations.
20492639:19	Information about the time of initiation of antibiotic treatment was often imprecise, in most cases only the date of initiation was recorded and some patients who actually did not receive anti-legionella treatment within 24 hours of admission may have been misclassified.
20492639:20	This potential bias would cause us to underestimate the effect of early initiation of anti-legionella treatment.
20492639:21	Values needed for CURB65 and PSI scores were not available in all medical records, therefore we may have underestimated the prognostic accuracy of these two severity adjustment tools.
20492639:22	Furthermore, the limited number of hospital-acquired cases reduced the power to detect variables significantly associated with increased mortality.
20492639:23	Only few studies have focused on differences between community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases of legionellosis . Pedro-Botet et al.  compared 125 hospital-acquired cases and 33 community-acquired cases of legionellosis and found that younger age, smoking, cough, thoracic pain, and extrapulmonary manifestations were more prevalent in the community-acquired cases, while chronic lung disease, cancer, elevated blood creatinine values, and treatment with oxygen and corticosteroids were more prevalent among hospital-acquired cases in an unadjusted analysis.
20492639:24	However, in the adjusted analysis only smoking and blood creatinine levels remained statistically significant.
20492639:25	No differences were found in clinical outcome . In our study, there were some notable differences between community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases.
20492639:26	Hospital-acquired cases had less typical signs and symptoms of pneumonia compared to community-acquired cases.
20492639:27	This might partly be explained by a more thorough medical history and examination when patients were admitted to the hospital compared to patients already being hospitalized - leading to information bias.
20492639:28	Clinicians should be very observant of the diagnosis of legionellosis since 20% of hospital-acquired cases did not have abnormalities on chest x-rays at onset of symptoms.
20492639:29	There was a marked delay of requesting testing for Legionella in HAL compared with CAL which again stresses the need for increased awareness and immediate access to diagnostics including PCR and urinary antigen testing.
20492639:30	With this combination of tests a high diagnostic sensitivity is likely to be achieved . 
Legionella-related mortality has decreased dramatically in the United States over the last decades.
20492639:31	Benin et al.  examined 6757 confirmed cases of legionellosis from 1980-1998.
20492639:32	During this period, case-fatality decreased from 46% to 14% for hospital-acquired cases, and from 26% to 10% for community-acquired cases.
20492639:33	This improvement in outcome may be attributed to more prevalent use of diagnostic tests and increased use of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy for pneumonia . The 30- and 90-days mortality-rate in our study was higher for both hospital-acquired and community-acquired cases than found by Benin et al. as well as in Pedro-Botet et al.'s study .
20492639:34	This could be explained to some extent by a more restrictive antibiotic policy in Denmark where the empirical antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is penicillin with an exception made in some local guidelines for patients with a CURB65 score >2; addition of anti-legionella therapy is recommended for these patients.
20492639:35	However, ascertainment bias must also be taken into account, i.e. that only the more severe cases of legionellosis tend to be diagnosed.
20492639:36	A direct comparison with the studies of Benin et al. and Pedro-Botet et al. is not possible due to differences in case definitions.
20492639:37	The studies by Benin et al. and Pedro-Botet et al. only included patients with Legionella pneumonia whereas we included all patients with legionellosis.
20492639:38	Since patients with Pontiac fever have a lower risk of dying, mortality in our study would probably have been even higher if we had excluded these patients from our analyses.
20492639:39	Among community-acquired cases in our study, treatment with an anti-legionella drug within 24 hours of admission was associated with a decreased risk of death, however, this did not reach statistical significance.
20492639:40	The lack of precision was primarily due to the limited sample size.
20492639:41	Delay of anti-legionella therapy has found to be associated with an increased risk of death in other studies.
20492639:42	A study of Heath et al.  of 39 serologically confirmed cases of legionellosis showed that the median delay in erythromycin therapy was 6 days for survivors and 11 days in those who died.
20492639:43	Gacouin et al.  showed in a study of 43 cases with severe legionellosis that fluoroquinolone administration within 8 hours of ICU admission was associated with a reduced mortality (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03-0.96).
20492639:44	In our study delayed treatment with anti-legionella antibiotics did not have a statistically significant impact on the risk of death among hospital-acquired cases.
20492639:45	One contributing factor could be confounding by indication, i.e. that the most severely ill patients tended to receive treatment earlier.
20492639:46	A limited number of studies have focused on prognostic factors in legionellosis.
20492639:47	Marston et al.  found that the likelihood of death from Legionella pneumonia was increased in patients who were elderly or male; this was also true for patients with hospital-acquired infection, renal disease, malignancy, immunosuppression, and for those with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 6.
20492639:48	Except from the sex-difference in mortality these findings were in accordance with ours.
20492639:49	Other studies of prognostic factors have only been done among patients with severe legionellosis requiring admission to ICU.
20492639:50	Gacouin et al.  found that a SAPS II score >46, more than 5 days duration of symptoms prior to ICU admission, and intubation were associated with increased mortality in patients with legionellosis in the ICU but some of these factors are likely to be an integral part of the pathways which leads from the infection to the outcome and thus do not qualify as confounders in the statistical modeling.
20492639:51	El-Ebiary et al.  also studied prognostic factors in patients with legionellosis requiring ICU admission and found that APACHE II score >15 at admission and serum sodium level <136 mmol/L were associated with a poor prognosis.
20492639:52	Instead of APACHE II or SAPS II scores we used the PSI score and CURB65 scores and these severity assessment tools could predict patients with an increased risk of death among community-acquired cases in the univariate analysis even though some observations needed for calculation of a full score were not available.
20492639:53	PSI risk class >2 remained an independent risk factor in the multivariate analysis.
20492639:54	Surprisingly, we found hyponatriemia to be an independent predictor of a decreased risk of death.
20492639:55	The association between hyponatriemia and legionellosis is well documented.
20492639:56	Thus, increased awareness of legionellosis in patients with pneumonia and hyponatremia may have caused physicians to request diagnostic testing for legionellosis and to prescribe anti-legionella antibiotics as observed in our study which could explain the lower mortality in this group.
20492639:57	We chose a statistical model without laboratory tests since abnormal values could be seen as intermediary steps in the process leading to a fatal outcome.
20492639:58	Likewise, we also excluded symptoms from the model and found in consistence with the study done by Marston  that age and comorbidities were related to an increased risk of death.
20492639:59	Conclusions 
Signs and symptoms of hospital-acquired legionellosis were less pronounced than in community-acquired cases.
20492639:60	However, the case fatality was almost 3 times higher.
20492639:61	The prognosis for Danish patients with legionellosis was worse than reported in a recent US long-term study and we found a notable diagnostic delay in hospital-acquired cases.
20492639:62	The study underlines that clinical awareness is important for the timely diagnosis and treatment especially of HAL.
20492639:63	National guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of legionellosis could raise awareness of the disease and may improve quality of care.
20492639:64	Studies of prognostic factors for legionellosis could further improve the therapeutic approach and potentially lead to a decrease in mortality.

19821774:0	Introduction 
Work from our group during the last 20 years has elucidated that estrogens protect the adult skeleton against bone loss by slowing the rate of bone remodeling and by maintaining a focal balance between bone formation and resorption.(
19821774:1	– ) Slowing of bone remodeling results from the attenuating effects of sex steroids on the birth rate of osteoclast and osteoblast progenitors.(
19821774:2	) Maintenance of a focal balance between formation and resorption results from opposite effects on the lifespan of osteoclasts and osteoblasts/osteocytes: a proapoptotic effect on osteoclasts and an antiapoptotic effect on osteoblasts and osteocytes.(
19821774:3	– ) The effects of estrogens on osteoclast and osteoblast apoptosis are exerted by a mechanism that is distinct from that requiring direct interaction of their receptors with DNA (hormone-response element) or protein-protein interaction between the receptor and other transcription factors.
19821774:4	Instead, the effect of estrogens on the apoptosis of either cell type is the result of an extranuclear action of the classical receptors that cause activation of cytoplasmic kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and kinase-dependent changes in the activity of transcription factors.(
19821774:5	, ) The mechanistic basis for the divergence of estrogens' effect on the survival of the two cell types downstream from ERKs is evidently dependent on the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation and the length of time that phospho-ERKs are retained in the nucleus, perhaps by determining the activation of a distinct set of transcription factors.(
19821774:6	) 
We have demonstrated previously that the number of osteoblast progenitors, as measured by colony-forming units–osteoblast (CFU-OB), increase after loss of estrogens in mice( ) and that this change is partially preserved in mice treated with bisphosphonates, which significantly decrease osteoclast number, strongly suggesting that bone resorption (and the release of growth factors from the bone matrix) is not required for the increase in osteoblast precursors.
19821774:7	Therefore, estrogens must suppress osteoblastogenesis by direct actions on early osteoblast precursors.
19821774:8	Further, we have shown that most CFU-OBs are early transit-amplifying progenitors (i.e., dividing cells with limited self-renewal capacity) and that their replication is indeed attenuated by estrogens.(
19821774:9	) 
We and others also have shown previously that estrogens attenuate the transcription of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) target genes.(
19821774:10	– ) BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily and play an essential role in skeletal development and repair.(
19821774:11	) Specifically, BMPs promote embryonic and postnatal osteogenesis by inducing the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and promoting osteoblast differentiation.(
19821774:12	) Binding of BMPs to their receptor serine/threonine kinases results in the phosphorylation of Smads 1, 5, and 8( ) at the carboxy terminus and translocation into the nucleus after heterodimerization with Smad4.
19821774:13	In the nucleus, the complex either binds to DNA sequences directly or can interact with several transcription factors to control the activity of hundreds of downstream target genes.(
19821774:14	) The Smad proteins consist of two globular domains (MH1 and MH2 domains) connected by a linker region.
19821774:15	In Smad 1, 5, and 8, the latter contains four MAPK phosphorylation sites and two putative GSK-3β sites.( ) Importantly, MAPK phosphorylation of the linker region inhibits Smad function and therefore BMP-induced transcription both in vitro and in vivo.(
19821774:16	– ) 
More recently, we and others have obtained evidence that the protective effects of estrogens on bone result from their ability to attenuate oxidative stress and that loss of estrogens accelerates the effects of aging.
19821774:17	Specifically, we have shown that C57BL/6 mice lose bone strength and mass progressively between the ages of 4 and 31 months( ) and that these changes are temporally associated with decreased osteoblast and osteoclast numbers and decreased bone-formation rate as well as increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis.
19821774:18	These changes are also temporally linked with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreased glutathione reductase (GSR) activity in the bone marrow, as well as a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of p66 shc—an adapter protein that serves as a key component of a signaling cascade that is activated by ROS and influences apoptosis and lifespan in invertebrates and mammals.(
19821774:19	) Indeed, proapoptotic signals, including ROS, release p66 shc from an inhibitory complex, and active p66 shc serves as a redox enzyme that catalyzes reduction of O 2 to H 2O 2 through electron transfer from cytochrome c.
19821774:20	H 2O 2, in turn, causes opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, swelling, and apoptosis.
19821774:21	An increase in ROS production and p66 shc phosphorylation, as well as decreased GSR activity, was reproduced acutely in our previous work by gonadectomy in either female or male C57BL/6 mice and prevented by the antioxidant N -acetyl-cysteine (NAC).( ) In agreement with our in vivo findings, results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that the effects of estrogens on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast and osteoblast apoptosis result from cell autonomous antioxidant actions of the hormone on the respective cell types, are dependent on the estrogen receptor (ER), and are mediated via ERKs.
19821774:22	Moreover, we have shown that estrogens attenuate the phosphorylation of p66 shc in osteoblastic cells and that this effect is also mediated via ERKs.
19821774:23	Based on these findings, we have proposed that loss of estrogens accelerates the effects of aging on bone by decreasing the defense against oxidative stress.
19821774:24	In this study we have investigated the molecular actions of ERα on osteoblasts using as a tool a mouse model bearing an ERα knock-in mutation that prevents binding to DNA ( ERα NERKI /−).( ) We previously determined that ERα NERKI /− mice have an atrophic uterus despite normal estrogen levels and that estrogen replacement does not restore it in ovariectomized (OVX) ERα NERKI /− mice, but it does induce the activation of ERKs and the ERK-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 in vertebrae.(
19821774:25	) In addition, in this study we have investigated in vitro the signaling cascades downstream from ERα that are responsible for its effects on osteoblast commitment and differentiation.
19821774:26	We show that the effects of estrogens on oxidative stress and the birth and death of osteoblasts are fully preserved in ERα NERKI /− mice.
19821774:27	Consistent with the attenuation of osteoblastogenesis in the ERα NERKI /− mice, 17β-estradiol (E 2) attenuates BMP-2-induced gene transcription and differentiation of preosteoblastic cell lines as well as primary cultures of calvaria- or bone marrow–derived osteoblastic cells from ERα NERKI /− mice as effectively as in cells from wild-type littermates.
19821774:28	This effect is due to an ERα-mediated activation of ERKs and the phosphorylation of Smad1 at the linker region of the protein, which leads to proteasomal degradation.
19821774:29	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The evidence presented in this report illustrates that estrogens attenuate oxidative stress as well as the differentiation and apoptosis of osteoblasts by a nonclassical mechanism of ERα action.
19821774:30	Specifically, our data reveal that the ability of estrogens to suppress oxidative stress and thereby attenuate the apoptosis of osteoblasts does not require binding of the ERα to DNA.
19821774:31	The demonstration of estrogens' ability to suppress ROS levels and increase GSR activity in the bone marrow of ERα NERKI /− mice strongly suggests that the dispensability of ERα binding to DNA for the antioxidant properties of estrogens extends beyond osteoclasts and osteoblasts and therefore must be a common mechanism of this property of estrogens in all their other target tissues.
19821774:32	Using the ERα NERKI /− mouse model, we have obtained compelling evidence that binding of ERα to DNA is also dispensable for the attenuating effects of estrogens on osteoblastogenesis.
19821774:33	Moreover, using a variety of osteoblastic models from mice and humans, including primary cultures of calvaria- and bone marrow–derived osteoblastic cells, we demonstrate herein that E 2 attenuates BMP-2-induced transcription and thereby osteoblastogenesis via ERK activation and downstream phosphorylation of Smad1 at the linker region of the protein, which leads to Smad1 proteasomal degradation.
19821774:34	Consistent with this mode of action, E 2 attenuated BMP-2-induced differentiation of primary cultures of calvaria- or bone marrow–derived osteoblastic cells from ERα NERKI /− mice as effectively as in cells from WT littermates, establishing that the DNA-binding function of the ERα is indeed dispensable for this effect.
19821774:35	These mechanisms are summarized in the model depicted in .
19821774:36	The evidence that estrogens attenuate osteoblast apoptosis and oxidative stress by an ERα-mediated mechanism that does not depend on the DNA-binding function of this receptor is consistent with extensive work of others showing that estrogens are indeed able to influence cells in their numerous reproductive and nonreproductive target organs, in part, by extranuclear actions of the ER involving kinase-mediated signaling.(
19821774:37	– ) In addition, the findings of this study are in agreement with earlier studies of ours showing that the suppressive effect of E 2 on H 2O 2-induced phosphorylation of p66 shc—a cumulative index of oxidative stress—is kinase-mediated and is inhibited by the ERK-specific inhibitor PD98059.( ) 
ERβ is intact in ERα NERKI /− mice, and therefore, we cannot categorically exclude the possibility that some of the effects of E 2 on this model are mediated by ERβ.
19821774:38	However, ERβ expression in murine bone is two to three orders of magnitude lower than ERα,( ) and osteoblast number and bone mass were unaffected in mice lacking ERβ.( ) In addition, studies in mice with a genuine null mutation of ERβ indicate that with the exception of impaired ovarian function, this isotype of the ER is not required in the mouse for the development and homeostasis of the major body systems.( ) In addition to regulating kinases, steroid receptors exert significant effects on gene expression without direct DNA binding, such as through transreppression of NF-κB or AP-1, leaving the possibility that the effects of estrogens on oxidative stress, osteoblastogenesis, and apoptosis may have resulted from protein-protein interaction of the ERα with either one of these transcription factors.
19821774:39	Such an alternative scenario, however, is very unlikely in the case of NF-κB because this particular transcription factor inhibits BMP-2-induced osteoblastogenesis.( ) 
Under basal conditions, ERα NERKI /− as well as ERα NERKI /+ mice exhibited decreased numbers of CFU-OBs compared with WT controls, raising the possibility that the DNA-binding domain of ERα may be required for normal osteoblastogenesis.
19821774:40	This clearly is not the case because CFU-OBs from mice lacking both ERα alleles were indistinguishable from WT controls.
19821774:41	Consistent with the decreased osteoblastogenesis, cancellous osteoblast number was decreased in the ERα NERKI /− mice compared to the ERα +/+ mice.
19821774:42	In addition, DXA measurements showed a decrease in bone mineral content of the femur and spine of both ERα NERKI /− and ERα NERKI /+ mice.
19821774:43	The mechanistic basis of the effects of the ERα NERKI /− mutant on basal osteoblastogenesis is unclear, and additional work, beyond the scope of this report, will be required to elucidate it.
19821774:44	A possible explanation is that the ERα NERKI protein interferes with osteoblastogenesis via a function that is unique to this mutant protein, for example, binding and sequestering a protein normally required for the process.
19821774:45	We also found that femoral and spinal BMD were decreased in the ERα +/− as compared with ERα +/+ mice, in contrast to the observations of Smith and colleagues that osteopenia is not a consequence of the haploinsufficiency of the ERα in humans,( ) but we cannot account for this discrepancy.
19821774:46	The decreased BMD of the ERα NERKI /− mice was confirmed by µCT measurements showing decreased BV/TV and trabecular thickness in the vertebrae, as well as decreased cortical thickness at the mid-diaphysis of the tibia compared with ERα +/+ mice.
19821774:47	In agreement with our findings, Syed and colleagues( ) have reported previously that the ERα NERKI /− mice have decreased cancellous BMD in multiple sites, but in their studies, cortical BMD was not different from that of the ERα +/+ mice.
19821774:48	Also in agreement with this earlier work of Syed and colleagues, we found that ERα NERKI /− mice lose bone mass (BV/TV) with OVX, but at the dose used in our study, estrogen replacement does not reverse this effect.
19821774:49	However, in difference from the report of Syed and colleagues, we found that OVX had no discernible effect on cortical thickness, whereas they reported that cortical thickness increased with OVX.
19821774:50	The reason for the difference is most likely because Syed and colleagues made their measurement 9 mm from the proximal end of the tibia.
19821774:51	Using a fixed distance would place the measurement more distally in the ERα NERKI /− mice, which have decreased tibia length compared with ERα +/+ mice.
19821774:52	Furthermore, a more distal measurement would inexorably occur in the tibia-fibular junction and include the cortex of two bones, thus confounding interpretation of the measurement.(
19821774:53	) 
A molecular explanation of the inhibitory effect of estrogens on osteoblastogenesis in vivo in both WT and ERα NERKI /− mice has been provided in this report by the in vitro demonstration that E 2 attenuates BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation and the transcription of BMP-2 target genes.
19821774:54	Importantly, the attenuating effect of E 2 on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro was indistinguishable in cells from ERα +/+ and ERα NERKI /− mice, strongly supporting the view that the DNA-binding function of the ERα is indeed dispensable for this effect.
19821774:55	Specifically, we have obtained evidence that similar to earlier findings regarding the anti- and proapoptotic effects of estrogens on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, the attenuation of BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation is mediated via activation of ERKs and, more precisely, that E 2 inhibits BMP-2 signaling by phosphorylating MAPK sites in the Smad1 linker region.
19821774:56	Similar to E 2, other activators of MAPK, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), have been shown to restrain BMP action during neural differentiation, limb development, and tooth formation.(
19821774:57	– ) Moreover, FGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibit BMP-induced gene expression and osteoblastogenesis in cell lines and primary human bone marrow–derived osteoblastic cells.(
19821774:58	– ) Phosphorylation of Smad1 by MAPK primes Smad1 for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β, which leads to Smad1 ubiquitination and degradation.
19821774:59	Importantly, activation of Wnt signaling (i.e., inhibition of GSK3β) abrogates Smad1 degradation, thereby prolonging the duration of the BMP signal.( ) Thus Smad1 represents a site of convergence of both negative (e.g., MAPK and GSK3β) and positive (e.g., Wnt) regulatory signals of BMP-induced transcription.
19821774:60	The convergence of multiple pathways on Smad1 underscores the importance of the modulation of the ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Smad1 by estrogens.
19821774:61	We had shown previously that activation of kinase-mediated actions of the ERα with synthetic ligands that selectively activate kinases without stimulating transcriptional activation results in increased osteoblast differentiation, whereas E 2 did not.
19821774:62	Interestingly, while both E 2 and the synthetic ligands phosphorylated ERKs, only the latter inactivated GSK3β and stimulated TCF-mediated transcription.( ) The evidence of this study that E 2 attenuates BMP-2-induced transcription is in agreement with our earlier observation that E 2 is unable to activate canonical Wnt signaling—an inhibitor of Smad1 degradation.
19821774:63	On the other hand, the ability of the synthetic ligands to stimulate osteoblastogenesis, whereas E 2 could not, may be explained by the property of the former compounds to activate both ERK and Wnt signaling. 
Different from the evidence reported herein, results of others from experiments with established cell lines (in some of which the level of ERα was artificially increased) or primary bone marrow stromal cell cultures have suggested that estrogens stimulate osteoblast differentiation, as evidenced by increased mineralization, alkaline phosphatase activity, and runx2 expression.(
19821774:64	– ) The discrepancy between the results of these earlier studies and ours may be due to the different experimental design.
19821774:65	Indeed, we searched for the effects of estrogen on osteoblast differentiation in a setting in which primary bone marrow (or calvaria-derived cell) cultures and the BMP stimulus were used in combination.
19821774:66	This combination was not used in those earlier in vitro studies.
19821774:67	In support of this explanation, Usui and colleagues, in line with our findings, have observed an attenuating effect of estrogens on BMP-induced alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS17/2.8
19821774:68	osteoblastic cells.(
19821774:69	) More important, in agreement with the conclusions of this report, Usui and colleagues found that mice lacking Tob, an inhibitor of BMP, exhibit superenhancement of osteoblastic activity and augmentation of the bone-formation and mineral-apposition rates following loss of estrogens.
19821774:70	In summary, the composite evidence from the in vitro and in vivo experiments described herein demonstrates that estrogens exert cell autonomous effects on the differentiation and apoptosis of osteoblasts and provides a molecular explanation of the well-documented fact that following loss of estrogens in humans and mice, bone formation increases, albeit not in balance with the increased bone resorption, as does the prevalence of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis.
19821774:71	In addition, the results of this report provide strong support of the view that the effects of estrogens on the birth and death of osteoblasts and osteocytes do not require the DNA-binding function of the ERα and result, in part, from antioxidant properties of these hormones.

Results 
Discussion 
We have provided genetic and biochemical evidence for a role of PDI in recognition of a misfolded cysteine-free secretory protein in the ER lumen and its export to the cytosol for degradation.
10613903:1	Our data define an important novel function of PDI in addition to its established enzymatic activities.
10613903:2	Membranes prepared from two new deletion mutants in PDI1 Δ222–302 and Δ252–277, were deficient in a cell-free assay for export of a misfolded secretory protein from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasomes.
10613903:3	The export substrate in this assay system, a mutant form of the yeast pheromone precursor prepro-α factor, Δgpαf, does not contain any cysteine residues, thus all our observations are independent of the enzymatic functions of PDI.
10613903:4	Chaperone-like properties of purified PDI, such as prevention of unfolded protein aggregation, promotion of folding of denatured substrates, and binding to peptides have been described previously ( ; ; ; ; ).
10613903:5	The physiological substrates of the chaperone PDI were unknown until now, however, and the importance the chaperone activity of PDI in the cell was not understood.
10613903:6	Noiva and coworkers mapped the peptide binding site of mammalian PDI to an acidic region within the COOH-terminal 50 amino acids of the protein, a region distinct from the enzymatically active sites ( a; ).
10613903:7	A purified truncation mutant of mammalian PDI, from which this peptide binding region has been deleted, no longer promotes the folding of denatured substrate proteins.
10613903:8	The central part of S . cerevisiae PDI (amino acids 252–277) is rich in acidic amino acids and shows weak homology to the peptide binding region of mammalian PDI.
10613903:9	Therefore, we created deletion mutants in yeast PDI centering around this region to investigate the physiological role of the chaperone function of PDI in yeast.
10613903:10	Cells harboring these deletion mutations were viable, and cell growth and transport of proteins through the secretory pathway was only moderately affected.
10613903:11	Neither of our deletion mutants specifically retained secretory proteins in the ER, indicating that both PDI mutant proteins had significant enzymatic activity, and that neither interfered nonspecifically with secretory protein packaging into ER-to-Golgi complex transport vesicles.
10613903:12	Export from the ER for degradation of disulfide-containing substrate proteins is redox potential dependent, suggesting that disulfide bonds need to be reduced before export ( ; ; ).
10613903:13	Here, we show that mutations in the enzymatically active sites of PDI retard the export and degradation of disulfide-containing CPY*, but not of thiol-free Δgpαf, suggesting that PDI is responsible for the reduction of disulfide bonds in degradation substrates before export.
10613903:14	CPY* and Δgpαf differ not only with respect to disulfide content: the removal of the N -glycosylation acceptor sites from wild-type α-factor precursor by mutagenesis causes degradation of the resulting Δgpαf.
10613903:15	In contrast, the presence and the appropriate trimming of the N-linked oligosaccharides of CPY* are essential for its degradation ( ; ).
10613903:16	Based on these data, Jakob and colleagues 1998 suggested that lectins recognizing specific N-linked oligosaccharide structures may be rate-limiting for export of CPY* to the cytosol.
10613903:17	Therefore, it is not surprising that the chaperone function of PDI is not strictly required for CPY* degradation.
10613903:18	Finally, deletion of the gene encoding the ER membrane protein Der1p results in dramatic stabilization of CPY* in the ER, but causes only a twofold increase of the half-life of Δgpαf (K.
10613903:19	Römisch, unpublished results).
10613903:20	Taken together, these data suggest that different subsets of quality control machinery in the ER recognize a variety of features in folding proteins, and subsequently trigger their export either into anterograde transport vesicles or back across the ER membrane to the cytosol.
10694254:0	INTRODUCTION 
The model of for the activation of voltage-dependent potassium channels postulates that voltage controls the conductance of membranes by changing the equilibrium between two states (resting and activated) of four identical and independent charged membrane particles.
10694254:1	This hypothesis was supported by the finding that potassium channels are composed of four subunits, each containing an S4 segment that consists of a sequence of basic residues conserved within the primary structure of voltage-gated ion channels, and therefore hypothesized to confer voltage sensitivity ( ; ; ).
10694254:2	The idea that S4 is the Hodgkin and Huxley voltage sensing gating particle has been supported by recent evidence based on S4 accessibility to internal and external solutions ( ; ; ; ; ; ), on total gating charge measurements after neutralization of its basic residues ( ; ), and on real-time fluorescence measurement of its motion ( ; ; ).
10694254:3	These studies showed that S4 traverses the membrane, moves across the membrane electric field in the direction expected for the voltage sensor, and can account for the majority of the gating current that is generated during channel activation (acidic residues in S2 and S3 may also contribute to the gating charge; ; ).
10694254:4	While the description of Hodgkin and Huxley captures some of the essential features of voltage-dependent gating (four identical gating particles, a sequence of transitions that yields sigmoidicity to channel opening), it has required two major modifications to account for the details of potassium channel gating.
10694254:5	First, voltage sensor movement occurs not in one but in several steps ( ; ; ; ; , ).
10694254:6	At least two of these steps are generated by sequential movements of S4.
10694254:7	Second, several lines of evidence indicate that late transitions that follow the major gating charge carrying steps are cooperative ( ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ).
10694254:8	The most successful models for gating of the Shaker potassium channel describe it as a series of independent charge carrying transitions followed by at least one concerted or highly cooperative transition.
10694254:9	Cooperativity in channel activation represents an issue of fundamental importance for understanding the mechanics of channel function.
10694254:10	Subunit interaction in activation is expected to have important physiological consequences by influencing voltage sensitivity in the same way that cooperative interaction among binding sites affects the sensitivity of an allosteric protein to ligand concentration.
10694254:11	Such cooperativity could account for the discrepancies previously described between voltage sensitivity and number of charges in S4 ( ; ; ; ; ).
10694254:12	Recent studies from the Aldrich laboratory have demonstrated a role for S4 in cooperativity in channel activation ( ; ).
10694254:13	found that a triple mutation in the Shaker S4, inserting the sequence of the Shaw S4, makes the voltage dependence of activation shallow and shifts it to positive voltages, while making the ionic current activate slowly, with a single exponential time course that lacks the sigmoidicity of Shaker . These effects were accounted for by slowing a final cooperative transition that follows the two independent charge-carrying steps per subunit according to the model of . As a consequence, this step, which itself appears to carry a small amount of gating charge ( ; ), becomes rate limiting for channel opening.
10694254:14	In other words, mutations in S4 can alter cooperative interactions between subunits in late steps of channel activation.
10694254:15	In this study, we used a novel approach to examine subunit interaction during activation.
10694254:16	We did this by taking advantage of the ability of voltage-clamp fluorometry to monitor particular gating rearrangements in site-specifically labeled protein segments of individual subunits in heterotetrameric Shaker channels.
10694254:17	Our test consisted in determining whether or not S4 movement of a labeled subunit is influenced by coassembly with other subunits having different S4 gating properties.
10694254:18	Absence of influence was taken to indicate independence and presence of influence to indicate cooperativity.
10694254:19	This approach allowed us to evaluate whether cooperative interactions occur during the major S4 charge carrying movements that have been previously thought to be independent.
10694254:20	We find that, of S4's two major charge-carrying steps, the first takes place independently in each subunit, whereas the second is influenced by cooperative interaction between S4 segments.
10694254:21	Our results suggest that at least some of this cooperativity is intrinsic to the second major S4 movement.
10694254:22	We interpret our results in light of the earlier kinetic models.
10694254:23	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
We designed a method to exclusively monitor a specific set of Shaker protein rearrangements in single subunits during channel gating transitions.
10694254:24	The method was based on three elements.
10694254:25	First, a cysteine substitution at S352 near the outer end of S4 allowed for the site-specific attachment of a sulfhydryl-reactive fluorescent probe.
10694254:26	As shown earlier, and further documented below, fluorescence of this labeled site tightly correlates with S4's voltage-sensing transmembrane rearrangements.
10694254:27	Second, coinjection was used to express channels made of a combination of subunits with and without the cysteine mutation.
10694254:28	Coinjections were weighted to favor the unlabeled subunit, yielding a large fraction of channels with only one labeled subunit that provided the bulk of the fluorescent signal (see materials and methods).
10694254:29	These constraints on stoichiometry were further assured by tandem linkage of subunits ( ; ).
10694254:30	Third, mutations that alter specific activation transitions were employed to make heteromeric channels in which the labeled and unlabeled subunits differ in known gating steps.
10694254:31	The expectation was, if certain activation transitions are cooperative, then gating movements in the labeled subunit would be altered by the presence of unlabeled subunits with distinct energetics of specific S4 gating steps.
10694254:32	To monitor the activation movements of S4, position S352C in S3–S4, near the NH 2 terminus of S4, was labeled with TMRM (see materials and methods).
10694254:33	Homotetramers made of S352C labeled with TMRM (C*) showed large fluorescence changes in response to voltage steps ( A), with a steady state fluorescence–voltage relation that was statistically indistinguishable from the voltage dependence of gating charge movement (q-v) ( B).
10694254:34	This indicates that C* fluorescence can serve as a reporter of S4's charge-carrying conformational changes in a labeled subunit.
10694254:35	DISCUSSION 
In this paper, we used a new approach to study interactions between subunits in heteromeric membrane proteins.
10694254:36	This method relies on the use of cysteine mutagenesis to introduce an attachment site for a thiol-reactive fluorophore into a specific functional domain of a subunit.
10694254:37	These modified subunits are coexpressed with subunits that cannot be labeled because they do not contain accessible cysteines.
10694254:38	In this manner, fluorescence measurements only monitor the structural rearrangements of the labeled domain in particular subunits without interference from signals in unlabeled subunits.
10694254:39	This approach makes it possible to define how rearrangements in a specific domain of one subunit, such as those evoked by voltage change or ligand binding, are coupled to functional rearrangements in other subunits of a multimeric protein.
10694254:40	The advantage of studying cooperativity in this manner is that it provides a clear indication of subunit interaction, circumventing the need to dissect apart gating or ionic currents, which are governed by the complex ensemble properties of all of the gating domains in each of the channel's subunits.
10694254:41	For this method to work, two criteria need to be met: (a) the fluorophore should report only on the conformational changes of the subunit to which it is bound, and (b) the fluorescence report of conformational rearrangements should not be distorted by interaction between fluorophores bound to multiple subunits of the same channel.
10694254:42	In this context, we have shown that Shaker channels carrying the substitution S352C labeled with TMRM (C*) fulfill these two criteria.
10694254:43	With respect to the first criterion, we showed that the fluorophore bound to this site is not sensitive to gating movements in neighboring subunits, since the f-v's of two distinct subunits (C*/V and C*/S) are different although they have the same three neighboring subunits (three Ws in the tetramers C*/V-W-W-W and C*/S-W-W-W; and ; ).
10694254:44	Further, the f-v of C*/V was the same whether associated with the same subunits in the homotetramer C*/V or with different subunits in the heterotetramer C*/V-W-W-W ( C).
10694254:45	The second criterion was met in that, despite the difference in the number of labeled subunits, the f-v's of C*/V and C*/S homotetramers, with four labeled subunits, were found to be equivalent to those of the linked heterotetramers C*/V-W-W-W and C*/S-S-S-S, with only one labeled subunit ( C and 7 B).
10694254:46	This data is consistent with evidence that the S3–S4 loop of one subunit is far enough away from the S3–S4 loops of other subunits to allow for their simultaneous binding of multiple molecules of the peptide hanatoxin.
10694254:47	Additionally, since basic residues in S4 have been shown to interact with acidic residues in the S2 and S3 of the same subunit, the microenvironment around an S3–S4 fluorophore is also likely to be defined by the same subunit.
10694254:48	We used this approach to determine whether activation during gating involves cooperative interactions between subunits of the Shaker potassium channel.
10694254:49	Our results, using two mutations that exert distinct effects on channel activation, indicate that a specific step of voltage sensing is cooperative, while another is independent.
10694254:50	This cooperativity influences both the energetics of specific S4 activation states and the conformation of S4 or of the protein that immediately surrounds it.
21103391:0	Introduction 
Advanced stage serous tumors account for the majority of invasive ovarian cancers and despite a generally good initial response to cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, most women face a high risk of recurrence and poor long-term survival . Platinum-based agents, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, are toxic to dividing cells due to the formation of DNA adducts that result in double strand breaks, activating DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals . Response to chemotherapy is, however, difficult to predict and there are currently no predictive biomarkers for serous ovarian cancers in clinical use.
21103391:1	We have previously mapped a region of 19q12 amplification associated with treatment-resistant serous ovarian tumors by performing a genome-wide survey of copy number change .
21103391:2	These findings were consistent with previous reports of amplification being associated with poor overall survival . Similarly, recurrent amplification of 19q12 has been reported in a variety of cancers including esophageal gastric lung and endometrial tumors . 
The 19q12 amplification is a high-level focal amplification that targets a cluster of only several genes on chromosome 19.
21103391:3	CCNE1 (Cyclin E) has previously been suggested as the target of amplification in ovarian cancer , however a systematic analysis of known genes within the amplicon has not been performed.
21103391:4	Furthermore, whilst CCNE1 amplification likely provides an oncogenic stimulus through activation of the cell cycle, it is not obvious how it may contribute to primary chemotherapy resistance.
21103391:5	For example, over-expression of CCNE1 in vitro renders ovarian cancer cells more sensitive to platinum agents, presumably due to increased proliferation .
21103391:6	It is possible that the biological consequence of 19q12 amplification is not limited to over-expression of CCNE1 and that other genes in the amplicon contribute to tumor growth or progression.
21103391:7	Furthermore, other co-existing mutational events elsewhere in the cancer genome may cooperate or enhance the oncogenic effect of CCNE1 over-expression.
21103391:8	We performed an siRNA knockdown screen of all annotated genes within and immediately flanking the 19q12 amplicon in ovarian cancer cell lines with or without regional amplification.
21103391:9	We found CCNE1 to be the only gene target within the amplicon that reduced cell viability in the amplicon-containing OVCAR-3 cell line after siRNA knockdown.
21103391:10	CCNE1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while also impairing clonogenic survival after cisplatin treatment, despite increasing in vitro drug resistance in a short-term cytotoxicity assay.
21103391:11	In a disease setting, these results suggest that treatment failure in CCNE1 amplified tumors may relate to rapid repopulation of the tumor after chemotherapy and not cellular drug resistance specifically.
21103391:12	We also found TPX2 amplification and over-expression to be significantly correlated with CCNE1 copy number status implying the presence of a cooperative mutational network between these genes.
21103391:13	Results 
Discussion 
We performed the first systematic siRNA knockdown of all genes within the minimally defined 19q12 amplicon in ovarian cancer showing that CCNE1 is the key oncogenic target.
21103391:14	Given known roles of Cyclin E1 in cancer, including de-regulation of the cell cycle and promoting genomic instability, it was the likely driver of the 19q12 locus, however other genes had not been excluded.
21103391:15	For example, C19orf2 which is immediately adjacent to CCNE1 has recently been annotated to encode URI, an unconventional prefoldin protein.
21103391:16	Studies of the C. elegans URI homologue suggest an involvement in chromatin remodeling, preventing and/or repairing endogenous genotoxic DNA damage and maintenance of genome integrity . More recently, URI has been identified as a key inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1γ (PP1γ) and is involved in regulation of the mTOR/S6K1 survival pathway based on nutrient and growth factor availability . Despite these intriguing biological associations, we found no evidence of URI as a driver of the 19q12 locus.
21103391:17	Reduction in cell viability after CCNE1 knockdown was specific to cell lines with 19q12 amplification, with limited or no effect in non-amplified lines, indicating an ‘addiction’ to CCNE1 deregulation.
21103391:18	Our findings validate a recent report showing amplification-specific sensitivity to CCNE1 attenuation in OVCAR-3 and IOSE-29 cells . Unamplified lines appeared to bypass siRNA mediated G1/S checkpoint arrest and apoptosis, possibly reflecting CCNE1 independent mechanisms of cell cycle de-regulation and distinct oncogenic processes.
21103391:19	Interestingly, increased expression of CCNE1 has recently been shown in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), a proposed precursor for high-grade serous carcinoma . This finding reinforces the significance of CCNE1 de-regulation in ovarian cancer and suggests it is an early requirement in tumor evolution.
21103391:20	19q12 amplification is strongly associated with primary treatment failure in ovarian tumors and is therefore both a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target.
21103391:21	Having identified CCNE1 as the driver of 19q12 amplification we sought to understand how it contributes to primary treatment failure.
21103391:22	In short-term cytotoxicity assays, over-expression of Cyclin E1 increases sensitivity to cisplatin .
21103391:23	Consistent with this data, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCNE1 induced G1 arrest in 19q12-amplified cell lines, possibly protecting cells from cisplatin damage occurring through cell cycle progression.
21103391:24	These findings, together with the lack of correlation of amplification status with in vitro cisplatin sensitivity of cell lines are at odds with the clinical behavior of primary tumors.
21103391:25	Significantly, we found that knockdown of CCNE1 profoundly inhibited clonogenic cell survival and this effect was augmented by cisplatin treatment.
21103391:26	Collectively, our findings suggest that 19q12 amplification does not increase resistance to chemotherapy per se but rather may confer a survival advantage post-treatment.
21103391:27	In addition to increased cellular division, high CCNE1 expression may assist re-entry into cell cycle from quiescence in surviving cells after chemotherapy . Uniquely amongst cell cycle proteins in Drosophila, Cyclin E1 over-expression has been shown to promote self-renewal of neuroblasts and may translate to an increased clonogenic capacity in tumor cells.
21103391:28	Although we were unable to generate stable OVCAR-3 with integrated shRNA directed to CCNE1 to further validate these findings in vivo these observations suggest that CCNE1 amplification may enhance the ability of tumor cells to repopulate the tumor after the cessation of chemotherapy.
21103391:29	We also sought to identify other mutational events that may enhance the effect of CCNE1 deregulation by seeking regions of copy number change that correlate with 19q12 gain.
21103391:30	Previous investigations of correlated gains include a recent study in breast cancer where co-amplification of 8p12 and 11q13 was identified and thought to cooperate functionally through activation of independent oncogenic pathways.
21103391:31	Cooperative networks in glioblastoma that are associated with outcome have also been identified through analysis of co-occurring copy number changes . We identified copy number change of three loci at 20q11, 1p36 and 6q27 to be significantly associated with CCNE1 amplification in ovarian tumors.
21103391:32	The 20q11 region contains twelve candidate genes, including TPX2 ASXL1 and BCL2L1 with expression correlated to CCNE1.
21103391:33	TPX2 is a microtubule-associated protein downstream of Ran-GTP that triggers microtubule nucleation.
21103391:34	It both activates and is a substrate for Aurora-A kinase and is important in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation during cell division [reviewed in 22].
21103391:35	Low copy number gain and protein over-expression has been observed in other tumor types including pancreatic tumors where siRNA knockdown reduced cell growth in vitro induced apoptosis and sensitized pancreatic cell lines to paclitaxel treatment . 
We chose to further investigate the role of TPX2 in ovarian cancer given its expression was most significantly correlated with CCNE1 . Furthermore, TPX2 has a plausible biological association with Cyclin E1, both having known cell cycle functions.
21103391:36	Unlike CCNE1 however, we did not find evidence of oncogene ‘addiction’ to TPX2 in cells with amplification.
21103391:37	In addition, cells sensitive to CCNE1 knockdown showed no further reduction in viability when simultaneously treated with siRNA against TPX2 . Notably, both OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-4 cells showed the greatest reduction in viability after single TPX2 knockdown.
21103391:38	Gene expression analysis in 19q12 amplified cells show that TPX2 gene expression is reduced after CCNE1 knockdown implying TPX2 acts downstream of CCNE1 and that simultaneous TPX2 knockdown has only a minimal additive effect.
21103391:39	The relationship between CCNE1 and TPX2 expression in vitro is consistent with the association identified in primary tumors and although our results suggest that TPX2 acts down stream of CCNE1 it may not be a key driver of the 20q11 amplicon.
21103391:40	A systematic analysis of other genes within the amplicon is required, which is often broad and contains a number of potentially important gene targets.
21103391:41	For example, the apoptotic regulator BCL2L1 adjacent to TPX2 has been previously suggested as a 20q11 amplification target in cancer .
21103391:42	Although not correlated with CCNE1 expression in our analysis, co-amplification of ID1 with CCNE1 may further contribute to cell cycle de-regulation in ovarian cancer.
21103391:43	ID1 is involved in proliferation and differentiation, and functions by inhibiting binding and activity of other helix-loop-helix transcription factors.
21103391:44	In breast cancer cells, gene knockdown has been shown to decrease CCNE1 expression and Cyclin E1/CDK2 activity . Interestingly, we also note the presence of a non-coding RNA (NCRNA00028) and two micro-RNAs (hsa-mir-1825 and hsa-mir-3193) within the defined region of chromosome 20q11 gain.
21103391:45	The potential effect of amplification on their function or subsequent de-regulation of downstream targets was not investigated in our current analysis.
21103391:46	However, we are not aware of any evidence that would link these molecules to the regulation of CCNE1 . 
In primary tumors, CCNE1 copy number was significantly associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival, with tumors bearing high-level amplification showing the worst outcome.
21103391:47	Copy number status was more informative than gene expression; a significant correlation with high expression and PFS was observed, but not for OS.
21103391:48	Similar to ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer, high-level CCNE1 amplification may therefore have predominant clinical utility in identifying patients most likely to have a poor response to standard treatment.
21103391:49	Interestingly, younger patients were less likely to have CCNE1 amplified tumors ( and ) suggesting a difference between the etiology of these tumors.
21103391:50	Our observations have potential implications for future therapeutic strategies based on targeting of cell cycle deregulation such as via cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibition.
21103391:51	To date, the clinical success of single-agent CDK inhibitors has been disappointing . Limited success may in part relate to off-target drug effects or redundancy between CDKs.
21103391:52	It is anticipated that chemotherapeutic agents may sensitize cells to CDK inhibition . However as shown here, interruption of G1/S transition may increase resistance to G1/S-phase targeted treatment and therefore CCNE1/CDK2 targeted therapies may need to appropriately phased with conventional therapy.

21143785:0	Introduction 
Advancement in high-throughput biological experiments has generated huge amounts of empirical data on the molecular foundations of biological structures and functions that require computer models for analysis.
21143785:1	The next challenge is to understand the complex interactions of biological processes and functions creating the intelligence of life.
21143785:2	The complexity increases manifold as we move into higher scales: interaction of large ensemble of cells in a tissue or interaction of tissues in an organ.
21143785:3	Thus, we need to develop a comprehensive model integrating molecular and genetic data for quantitative studies of physiology and behavior of biological processes at multiple scales . 
Existing models used in the understanding of biological processes can be divided into three main classes.
21143785:4	Quantum Mechanics based models (femtosecond-picosecond; ) are used to understand the structure of macro molecules.
21143785:5	The functional understanding of biological molecules (like binding properties, configuration states after binding and other individual properties of the molecular reactions) are well studied by the Molecular dynamics based model (picosecond-nanosecond; 1nm-10nm).
21143785:6	The next challenge is to understand the biological intelligence created by the usage of the macro molecules in the cell.
21143785:7	These are accomplished by the Mesoscale Dynamics (nanosecond-seconds; 10nm-1mm) models, and Cellular-level/Organ-level simulation schemes.
21143785:8	Such simulation schemes are again broadly classified into two categories: (a) Continuous system models [ - ], employing differential equations to simulate cellular dynamics used in tools like Dizzy  and JARNAC ; (b) Stochastic discrete time models, like StochSim  and M-cell , that have been developed for capturing the stochastic nature of molecular interactions within the existing framework of rate equations in continuous time domain.
21143785:9	Most of these models focus on intracellular biochemical reactions and require accurate estimation of a very large number of system parameters for providing systemic understanding of underlying processes.
21143785:10	More integrative tools at the whole cell level have also been developed, which try to model cellular mechanisms and present visual representation of their functionality . 
Recently, it was shown that gene expression type interactions create a stochastic resonance  within the system and hence deterministic models are inappropriate for this process.
21143785:11	The Gilliespie simulation  incorporates the dynamics of the chemical master equation by approximately handling the stochasticity of the mass-kinetic equations.
21143785:12	As the temporal variability of reaction time is appreciable within a biological process, this method suffers from simulation stiffness.
21143785:13	Moreover, this model represents the biological pathways through a set of reaction equations without showing their relation to the biological functions creating the pathway.
21143785:14	Any change in the pathway description may change the complete set of equations.
21143785:15	Also their approach has computational overheads and require estimates of all the rate constants.
21143785:16	With the existing systems in perspective, we present a discrete-event driven paradigm - modeling a composite system by combining the state variables in the time-space domain as events and determining the immediate dynamics between the events by using statistical analysis or simulation methods.
21143785:17	To reduce computational overhead we transform the different diffusion and molecular interactions within a cell from the thermodynamic energy based fields to the information theory field by suitable abstraction of the energy field profiles into selected statistical distributions.
21143785:18	Our goals are to : (1) Use the results of the Quantum Mechanics based models (molecular structure data) and Molecular dynamics models (molecular binding data) to create the micro-level biological event models.
21143785:19	(2) Transform the energy driven biological effects to information theory parameters in the probabilistic domain considering the biological functions.
21143785:20	(3) Develop event models to estimate the statistics of the biological event.
21143785:21	(4) Develop a discrete-event based “in silico” simulation for complex systems.
21143785:22	The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
21143785:23	We briefly present an overview on the different modeling and simulation paradigms in Section Modeling and Simulation landscape.
21143785:24	Next, we introduce the discrete event based simulation framework in Section Discrete Event Simulation Technique.
21143785:25	In Section PhoPQ Biological System Model, we present the concept of event abstraction of biological pathways using the PhoPQ biological system in Salmonella.
21143785:26	We introduce the analytical models for the molecular transport mechanisms in Section Analytical Models for Molecular Transport.
21143785:27	In Section Numerical Results for the Molecular Transport Models, we present the performance results and validation of the molecular transport models.
21143785:28	Section Simulation Results of the PhoPQ system presents some in silico results from the discrete event simulation of the PhoPQ system, to validate the performance of the simulation engine and also provides some examples of in silico hypothesis tests.
21143785:29	Finally, we conclude in Section Conclusion and provide some directions for future work.
21143785:30	A short version of this paper appeared in . 
Conclusion 
We have proposed a new “in silico” modeling technique capturing the temporal dynamics of biological systems at multiple scales that can be simulated by the discrete event technique.
21143785:31	For this, we need the transformation of biological functions into information theory based measure like probability distributions of event time.
21143785:32	We have presented one example of the transformation of a biological function (i.e., molecular transport time) driven by concentration and potential gradients in this paper.
21143785:33	We also validated the molecular transport models and put together a discrete event simulation for the PhoPQ system to validate the system level dynamics based results with experimental estimates.
21143785:34	We also used this molecular transport model to generate some in-silico hypothesis testing results on the PhoPQ system.
21143785:35	The proposed stochastic models meet the accuracy and computational speed requirements for modeling complex biological processes.
21143785:36	These models are parametric and can be used for different cases of molecular transport.
21143785:37	Once the complete set of mathematical models for the different biological functions are in place, it should be possible to reuse these models to construct other biological process models with marginal changes.
21143785:38	The models provide for both speed of computation and flexibility that is required to model the dynamics of an entire cell.
21143785:39	We envisage the development of an efficient tool for understanding the dynamics of complex biological systems that can model the multi-scale biological process at a coarse grain accuracy.

20179798:0	INTRODUCTION 
The multicentre phase iii randomized Breast Cancer International Research Group ( bcirg) 001 trial (“ tac– fac”) showed that efficacy with docetaxel (Taxotere: Sanofi–Aventis, Laval, QC) in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide ( tac protocol) was improved over that with the standard protocol of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide ( fac) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer.
20179798:1	The study observed 1491 women between the ages of 18 and 70 years with axillary node–positive breast cancer who were randomly assigned to 6 cycles of either tac or fac as adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.
20179798:2	Administration of granulocyte colony–stimulating factor ( g- csf) was given to only patients who experienced 1 episode of febrile neutropenia or infection.
20179798:3	As compared with fac, the tac regimen was associated with a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia, but this higher incidence did not result in a significantly different or elevated rate of moderate-to-severe infection in the patients who received tac chemotherapy.
20179798:4	During a 5-year follow-up period, the study showed improved disease-free survival ( dfs, primary efficacy endpoint) and overall survival ( os, secondary endpoint) for patients receiving the tac protocol as compared with those receiving the fac protocol . The expansion of the indication for tac from advanced to early breast cancer may lead to an increase in chemotherapy expenditures for hospitals and provincial payers alike.
20179798:5	However, recurrences avoided by the use of tac will have an effect in terms of years of life saved and may generate cost savings attributable to the reduction in disease recurrence.
20179798:6	OBJECTIVE 
The objective of the present economic analysis was to compare, from the perspective of Cancer Care Ontario ( cco) and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the effectiveness, cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness of two adjuvant chemotherapy strategies after primary surgery for breast cancer in women with operable, axillary lymph node–positive breast cancer: 
METHODS 
The tac– fac study showed that 6 cycles of the tac protocol were superior to 6 cycles of the fac protocol with respect to dfs and os in a group of patients with node-positive breast cancer over a 5-year time horizon . The cost of tac is greater than the cost of fac when it comes to acquisition, administration, and adverse event management.
20179798:7	Given the superior efficacy but higher cost of tac, a cost-effectiveness analysis was considered a reasonable economic evaluation .
20179798:8	An incremental cost per life-year ( ly) gained was the primary economic outcome.
20179798:9	A secondary economic outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year ( qaly) gained.
20179798:10	A Markov model, developed from the perspective of cco and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, was used to follow a population of patients treated in the tac– fac study [1480 subjects, 99.3% of the overall population; 744 in the tac arm (99.9%), 736 in the fac arm (98.7%); median age: 49.0 years].
20179798:11	Patients in the tac arm experienced 141 recurrences (19.0%) and 162 deaths (21.8%); in the fac arm, the numbers were 195 (26.5%) and 246 (33.4%) respectively . A cycle length of 6 months was used.
20179798:12	The decision–analytic model started at the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.
20179798:13	The model measured disease recurrences within the remaining years of life for all patients, and it comprises these health states: 
“Deceased” is an “absorbing state.”
20179798:14	Any given woman could stay in the other three “non-absorbing” health states for more than one Markov cycle.
20179798:15	All women start in the No Recurrence state.
20179798:16	Any given women could stay at the same state for more than one cycle or progress into the next state, with the final state being Deceased.
20179798:17	The lifetime horizon included two time periods, a period of treatment and observation (5 years, corresponding to the length of the tac– fac study) and a period of follow-up for surviving patients (beyond the 5th year until death).
20179798:18	The construct of this model makes certain assumptions.
20179798:19	Recurrences (at 5 years) are considered mutually exclusive: patients could have either a Locoregional or Distant (Metastatic) recurrence.
20179798:20	Death can occur after the No Recurrence, Locoregional Recurrence, or Distant (Metastatic) Recurrence states.
20179798:21	In the base-case analysis, the assumption was made that filgrastim ( g- csf) was given secondary to an episode of febrile neutropenia per the tac– fac study protocol, and a standard weight was used for patients.
20179798:22	Transfusion rates were based on the percentage of patients that had a “need for blood transfusions” as reported in the tac– fac study .
20179798:23	The base-case analysis comparing tac with fac was constructed using the entire population of the tac– fac study and g- csf as secondary prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia over a lifetime time horizon.
20179798:24	Two measures of effectiveness (outcome) were considered in the analysis: lys gained (based on study dfs) and qalys gained.
20179798:25	Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events of febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, diarrhea, and infection were included.
20179798:26	Results at 5 years from the tac– fac study were used to derive the 6-month constant probabilities of Locoregional Recurrence and Distant (Metastatic) Recurrence, and the 6-month constant probabilities of Death for patients coming from any previous state [No Recurrence, Locoregional Recurrence, and Distant (Metastatic) Recurrence].
20179798:27	Health utilities were not collected during the tac– fac study, and we therefore obtained sources in the literature – . The disutility associated with the use of docetaxel in the tac arm was based on the disutility associated with adverse events in patients who had received docetaxel in the tac– fac study, the probability of an adverse event, the number of adverse events, and the duration of adverse events in that study .
20179798:28	The disutility associated with adverse events was calculated to be 0.0072 for the tac regimen and was found to be 0.0035 for the fac regimen, for a difference of 0.0037.
20179798:29	In the base case, the utility value for the fac regimen was assumed to 0.72 (reflecting utility values for adjuvant chemotherapy ) and the utility value for the tac regimen was calculated to 0.7163 (based on the utility value for fac, less the incremental disutilities attributable to the adverse events: 0.72 – 0.0037).
20179798:30	Utility values for health states were the same for both groups.
20179798:31	For No Recurrence, Locoregional Recurrence, and Distant (Metastatic) Recurrence, utility values were 0.960 0.816 and 0.49–0.65 (mean: 0.57) respectively.
20179798:32	RESULTS 
The base-case analysis used in this model applied a 5% discount rate, the Canadian costs for chemotherapies recommended by cco guidelines and febrile neutropenia rates based on the available tac– fac study results . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( icer) for tac compared with fac was $6,921.24/
20179798:33	ly gained.
20179798:34	The incremental cost–utility ratio ( icur) for tac compared with fac was $6,848.39/
20179798:35	qaly.
20179798:36	Several one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
20179798:37	Adverse event rates used in the base-case model were altered in a variety of ways in the sensitivity analyses.
20179798:38	When the rates were increased by 25%, the incremental ratios were $7,129.14/
20179798:39	ly gained and $7,054.09/
20179798:40	qaly gained.
20179798:41	When decreased by 25%, the incremental ratios were $6,713.35/
20179798:42	ly gained and $6,642.68/
20179798:43	qaly gained.
20179798:44	When adverse event rates were increased and decreased by 25% in the tac group only, the icers were $7,188.70/
20179798:45	ly gained and $6,653.78/
20179798:46	ly gained for tac and fac respectively, and the icurs were $7,113.03/
20179798:47	qaly and $6,583.74/
20179798:48	qaly respectively.
20179798:49	Febrile neutropenia rates were increased and decreased by 25%, giving incremental ratios of $7,076.75/
20179798:50	ly and $7,002.26/
20179798:51	qaly gained and $6,765.73/
20179798:52	ly and $6,694.52/
20179798:53	qaly gained for tac and fac respectively.
20179798:54	The bootstrapping sensitivity analysis examined a lower and an upper bound for the cost per dfs.
20179798:55	The icers ranged from $3,132.16/ dfs for the best-case scenario to $20,370.59/
20179798:56	dfs for the worst-case scenario.
20179798:57	The icurs ranged from $3,060.59/ qaly for the best-case scenario to $20,036.64/
20179798:58	qaly for the worst-case scenario.
20179798:59	When the model was run using the adverse events observed in the geicam study, in which no primary g- csf prophylaxis was allowed, the icer was $6,893.22/
20179798:60	ly gained and the icur was $6,820.66/
20179798:61	qaly gained for tac compared with fac.
20179798:62	The results of this analysis were very comparable to those based on the tac– fac study, which supports our rationale for using the adverse events rates in the geicam study to evaluate the effect of primary g- csf prophylaxis on the cost-effectiveness of the tac regimen.
20179798:63	When g- csf was given as primary prophylaxis, the incremental costs were $13,183.26/
20179798:64	ly and $13,044.49/
20179798:65	qaly gained for tac compared with fac.
20179798:66	The overall cost and the incremental benefit were both higher as compared with the base-case results when g- csf was given prophylactically before each cycle.
20179798:67	also outlines additional sensitivity analyses (including relapse rate, follow-up costs, ratio of recurrence, and utility) and additional analyses with g- csf as a primary prophylaxis.
20179798:68	Increases in the costs associated with follow-up of patients with No Recurrence are observed to result in increased icers, whereas increases in the costs associated with follow-up of patients with Distance (Metastatic) Recurrence are observed to result in a decreased icer, but to a far lesser extent than the increase seen with No Recurrence.
20179798:69	DISCUSSION 
Based on the literature, tac offers improved dfs compared with fac, at a higher cost .
20179798:70	Patients receiving tac had a 6-month greater life expectancy than did patients receiving fac.
20179798:71	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for tac compared with fac ($6,921.24/
20179798:72	ly gained and $6,848.39/
20179798:73	qaly gained) indicate good economic value for tac treatment in the adjuvant setting of node-positive breast cancer patients.
20179798:74	Life expectancies adjusted by utilities were lower than the unadjusted life expectancies, but the difference in qalys gained between the two study groups was greater than the observed difference in lys gained, explaining why the cost per qaly gained is lower than the cost per ly gained.
20179798:75	According to this model, and based on its assumptions, tac is a cost-effective treatment for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.
20179798:76	Results show that adjuvant tac—with secondary and primary prophylaxis—provides good economic value for women with node-positive breast cancer.
20179798:77	The major cost drivers of this model are the drug acquisition costs of tac and the proportion of patients who achieved dfs.
20179798:78	In general, the sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust to change.
20179798:79	Variations in chemotherapy costs, follow-up costs, supportive care costs, and utility values resulted in relatively similar incremental ratios for the cost per ly gained and the cost per qaly gained.
20179798:80	Variations in rates of dfs had a significant effect on the incremental ratios—namely, poor dfs would result in a higher incremental ratio.
20179798:81	Our results were consistent with those from Au et al. who reported a cost per qaly of $18,505.54.
20179798:82	They used Alberta provincial costs and also based their analyses on the tac– fac study.
20179798:83	A similar study in the United Kingdom, with the same clinical trial data, also found that tac was more cost effective than fac.
20179798:84	A model was also constructed around the data from the bcirg 001 trial to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tac compared with fac as adjuvant therapy for node-positive breast cancer.
20179798:85	Parameters and sensitivity analyses were built around adverse events, cost of chemotherapy and support, survival estimates, utility weights, and costs of monitoring and care after relapse.
20179798:86	The cost-effectiveness of tac compared with fac was £15,418/ ly gained and £18,188/ qaly gained.
20179798:87	That study also looked at g- csf as primary prophylaxis and found an increase to £29,432/ qaly gained.
20179798:88	Although the icer was reported to be higher, the overall conclusions were similar to our own.
20179798:89	The higher values may have resulted from the inclusion of additional adverse events such as anemia, pain, and vomiting.
20179798:90	And because the analysis reflected the perspective of the U.K. National Health Service, differences in the cost of follow-up and community care may also have affected the icer . 
Our study has a number of limitations.
20179798:91	As used in the model, the clinical data from the tac– fac trial and the assumptions used when trial data were not available to estimate long-term costs may not be representative of real-life experience.
20179798:92	Hormonal therapies were not included in the calculation of the cost-effectiveness because, per the tac- fac study, tamoxifen was administered on completion of chemotherapy to patients with estrogen or progesterone receptor–positive (or both) tumours.
20179798:93	This treatment strategy would have been applied to both groups, and thus would have not affected the results for one therapy or the other.
20179798:94	The relative cost-effectiveness of fec- d (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, followed by docetaxel), a more commonly used regimen relative to tac, can be inferred from the results presented here and the 2008 cost-effectiveness analysis by Younis et al. who compared the cost-effectiveness of fec-100 (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) with that of fec- d in women with node-positive breast cancer on adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical treatment.
20179798:95	Their study reported an incremental cost difference of $3,544 per patient and an icur of $14,612/ qaly gained . They used a Markov model and reported the incremental cost utility over a 10-year horizon.
20179798:96	Considering that the tac regimen has shown efficacy comparable to that of the fec-100 regimen, per the 5-year dfss and oss observed in the bcirg 001 and pacs 01 studies, and that the tac regimen is, in general, more costly than the fec-100 regimen, the fec- d regimen could be expected to show a cost-effectiveness ratio comparable to the one reported by Younis et al. or even better when compared with the tac regimen.
20179798:97	CONCLUSIONS 
Clinical results have shown that tac is superior to fac in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint of dfs and the secondary endpoint of os.
20179798:98	The tac regimen offered improved response at a higher cost than that for fac.
20179798:99	The incremental cost was $6,921.24/
20179798:100	ly gained and $6,848.39/
20179798:101	qaly gained for tac as compared with fac when secondary g- csf prophylaxis is given.
20179798:102	These costs increase to $13,183.26/
20179798:103	ly gained and $13,044.49/
20179798:104	qaly gained when primary g- csf prophylaxis is given in the tac group.
20179798:105	Overall, the cost-effectiveness ratios for tac compared with fac are low, indicating good economic value for the tac treatment in the adjuvant setting of node-positive breast cancer patients.

19561197:0	INTRODUCTION 
The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their essential role in translational regulation has brought to light a promising new class of RNA therapeutic targets.
19561197:1	MiRNAs are short, naturally occurring RNA molecules that regulate translation of messenger RNAs by binding to sequences in their 3′-untranslated regions.
19561197:2	They are important regulators of development and cellular responses to stress.
19561197:3	Consistent with their ubiquitous role in regulating translation, aberrant expression of specific miRNAs is often associated with disease of disregulated translation.
19561197:4	Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are among the disease for which this association is well established.
19561197:5	Signature profiles of miRNA expression accompany the cancerous state, and a miRNA that is dramatically up-regulated in the expression signatures of many solid tumors is miR-21.
19561197:6	This miRNA targets tumor suppressor genes, including pro-apoptotic genes such as PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4).
19561197:7	By suppressing translation of pro-apoptotic genes, miR-21 contributes to an essential feature of the cancer phenotype, a diminished ability to undergo programmed cell death.
19561197:8	Inhibition of miR-21 function renders cancer cells vulnerable to self-destruction.
19561197:9	Increased expression of miR-21 is also a characteristic of the miRNA profile associated with pathological remodeling of heart tissue in response to persistent stress.
19561197:10	This effect is characterized by increased cardiac size and re-expression of fetal genes, and miR-21 appears to regulate these responses.
19561197:11	Thus, increased expression of miR-21 is associated with cancer and heart disease, implicating it as a potential therapeutic target in both of these conditions.
19561197:12	Like other miRNAs, miR-21 is produced by excision from a longer primary transcript, where it is found in the stem of a hairpin structure.
19561197:13	Endonucleases cleave the hairpin from the primary transcript and remove the apical loop.
19561197:14	Cleavage from the primary transcript by the ribonuclease Drosha is emerging as an important point at which miRNA expression is regulated.
19561197:15	Expression of miR-21 is promoted by factors that recruit the microprocessor, the complex of Drosha and associated proteins, to its primary transcript.
19561197:16	Conversely, the RNA-binding protein Lin-28 mediates diminished processing of Let-7 family pri-miRNAs by association with the loop of the precursor hairpin.
19561197:17	This natural regulation of miRNA processing suggests a strategy for manipulating miRNA levels: binding of a small molecule within or adjacent to the hairpin loop of a miRNA precursor could interfere with its maturation.
19561197:18	However, discovery of small molecule ligands for specific, pre-defined RNAs remains a significant challenge.
19561197:19	As a result, specific ligands are known for only a small number of disease-related RNAs.
19561197:20	Structure-based methods have been possible in a few cases, but the lack of high-resolution structural data for most RNAs of interest favors screening of diverse chemical collections and combinatorial libraries for specific RNA-binding molecules.
19561197:21	In the study presented here, we have screened a combinatorial library of N-substituted oligoglycines, commonly called peptoids, for molecules with specific affinity for the hairpin loop of the miR-21 precursor.
19561197:22	Peptoids are peptidomimetic compounds that are cell permeable, protease resistant, and easily synthesized in highly diverse libraries by solid phase ‘split-pool’ synthesis.
19561197:23	We screened the peptoid library in a microarray format.
19561197:24	Microarrays of surface-bound small molecules are increasingly important tools for high-throughput screening and discovery of new ligands.
19561197:25	They have been used to discover new protein–small molecule interactions and to profile the specificities of known RNA-binding antibiotics.
19561197:26	The microarray format offers potential benefits as a means to discover new ligands.
19561197:27	Thousands of compounds can be screened simultaneously on microarrays with low requirements for costly RNA samples, and many replicate arrays can be printed from a single chemical library, allowing the same library to be screened against multiple targets or in multiple screening trials with the same target.
19561197:28	We have used peptoid microarrays as the foundation for a system of RNA ligand discovery in which lead compounds with specific affinity are identified by screening, and the positive, specific molecular interactions discovered are utilized to create improved ligands.
19561197:29	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
This work demonstrates the utility of peptoid microarrays for discovering new ligands for specific RNAs.
19561197:30	Previous work has employed the microarray format as a quantitative analytical tool to profile the relative affinities and specificities of known RNA-binding antibiotics and to find improvements to peptide sequences that bind to an RNA required for packaging HIV.
19561197:31	Recently, Labuda and co-workers reported a screen of peptoids in a microarray format to find improved inhibitors of a group I intron.
19561197:32	These efforts used libraries of 4–120 different RNA-binding compounds.
19561197:33	To discover new ligands for a novel, pre-defined RNA target, we have used the microarray platform as a qualitative tool to screen a relatively large library of 7680 different compounds.
19561197:34	As a qualitative screen, it is akin to bead-based library screens, in which a library of compounds on beads is screened for binding to a fluorescently labeled biomolecule, and hit compounds are identified by visual brightness of individual beads with the use of a fluorescent microscope.
19561197:35	However, having the library elements arrayed on a surface allows systematic consideration of each, which is difficult in the bead-based format.
19561197:36	Also, the ability to perform replicate experiments allows confirmation of reproducibility and specificity prior to hit identification and solution-phase testing.
19561197:37	The miR-21 precursor hairpin is a novel target, without previously known small molecule ligands, and very few sequence-specific ligands are known for any RNA hairpin loop.
19561197:38	Thus, we had no a priori expectations for the affinities that library compounds with specificity for the target RNA would have.
19561197:39	For this initial test of the approach, our goal was to discover positive and specific molecular interactions that can be subsequently utilized toward making ligands of high affinity and specificity.
19561197:40	We chose the peptoid scaffold for our library, in part, because these subsequent steps are facilitated by the ease with which peptoids can be modified.
19561197:41	We attempted to bias our library toward a baseline affinity of K d ∼1–10 mM by including arginine in every library element.
19561197:42	The affinity of the diglycine linker was fortuitous, since we had no prior expectation that it would contribute to binding.
19561197:43	Together, the arginine and glycine components of the library contribute 4.9 kcal/mol (calculated from the K d) to the free energy of association of the library elements to the target RNA, with a weak specificity for the target RNA over the control.
19561197:44	Most of the array features gave no indication of binding the labeled target RNA, but 12% of them were fluorescent after its application, some with SNR greater than 100.
19561197:45	Most of these features displayed similar signal to noise with the control hairpin.
19561197:46	The compounds rich in alkyl amines that were predominant among the peptoids with high signal to noise are likely to have high affinity for the RNA because the amines are substantially protonated, creating an electrostatic attraction for the polyanionic RNA.
19561197:47	While some of these compounds may have specificity for the target RNA that could be revealed by screening under more stringent conditions and by rigorous quantitation of the fluorescent signal, a large nonspecific component of binding is likely to interfere with optimization of the specific interactions.
19561197:48	Therefore, we focused our attention on hit compounds that reproducibly showed no interaction with the control hairpin.
19561197:49	Both of the compounds to which this requirement narrowed our focus had affinity for the target RNA in solution 15- to 20-fold higher than the affinity of a compound that did not bind the labeled target on the array (compound 3 ).
19561197:50	The affinity of compound 3 is comparable to that of the arginine and linker alone ( 4 ).
19561197:51	Thus, the array screen was successful in identifying compounds from the library that are better ligands than one that shows no interaction on the array.
19561197:52	The variable peptoid components of the lead compounds identified contribute ∼20-fold to the affinity over the arginine and glycines alone, corresponding to ∼1.6 kcal/mol of additional free energy of binding.
19561197:53	Furthermore, peptoids 1 and 2 share common features that are not found in other library elements: an aromatic heterocycle at the N-terminus and an oxygen three atomic centers from the backbone in the second position.
19561197:54	These similarities suggest involvement of specific molecular interactions in the binding of the RNA, supporting the conclusion that the microarray screen successfully identified library elements that form positive, specific interactions with the target.
19561197:55	Though the signal to noise ratio of compound 1 near the threshold of being visible, was significantly lower than that of compound 2 the solution phase affinities of these two compounds for the target were similar, indicating that fluorescent signal on the array is influenced by factors other than solution-phase affinity, such as linker effects, well known in the interactions of surface-bound ligands with RNA.
19561197:56	Though the specificities of the initial lead compounds are modest, the 4.7-fold specificity of 1 is significant in light of the similarity between the target and control hairpins and the paucity of ligands reported in the literature with appreciable sequence specificity for RNA hairpin loops.
19561197:57	This difference is all the more significant in light of the fact that it is primarily due to the sequence order within the five-nucleotide loop, the loop sequence composition being held constant, with little dependence on other differences between the target and control hairpins.
19561197:58	Furthermore, much of this specificity can be attributed to distinct functional elements of the ligand.
19561197:59	The terminal pyridine and the hydroxyethyl side chain contribute the majority of the free energy of association that is specific to the target RNA.
19561197:60	Although these groups contribute specific interactions to the complex, they do not necessarily optimize those interactions.
19561197:61	The potential for enhancing these contacts suggests an avenue for improvement of the lead compound, by screening a series of derivatives in which a critical group is incrementally varied.
19561197:62	This approach was immediately productive when applied to the terminal pyridine of 1 . By simply varying the position at which the pyridine is linked to the backbone, the affinity and specificity were both increased.
19561197:63	The affinities of the resulting compounds for the target RNA are comparable to the affinity of DGCR8, the double-stranded RNA-binding component of the microprocessor complex, for primary miRNAs.
19561197:64	This is true for compound 13 in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of mono- and divalent cations.
19561197:65	Development of further optimized ligands by testing conservative variations of the hydroxyethyl side chain is in progress.
19561197:66	The process followed to discover ligand 13 illustrates a systematic approach to the development of ligands for specific, pre-defined RNA molecules.
19561197:67	The screen of a library of potential ligands is the first step, aimed at discovery of specific interactions.
19561197:68	The library is designed so that its members not only have desirable qualities for biologically active compounds (cell permeability, limited size, biological stability), but are also easily modified in the subsequent steps, when the structural elements of the lead compounds that contribute specific affinity are identified and varied to find improvements.
19561197:69	Work is underway to test the effects of the ligands found here on miRNA processing in cell culture and in cell-free miRNA processing assays and to explore the broader biological effects of these compounds.
19561197:70	Though cleavage of miRNA precursors by Drosha does not depend on specific loop sequences, mutations that stabilize an internal conformation of the loop diminish or abolish cleavage.
19561197:71	Thus, a ligand that recognizes, thereby stabilizing, a hairpin conformation might similarly inhibit processing.
19561197:72	This inhibition could be realized even if the bound conformation is different from the most stable conformation in the absence of ligand.
19561197:73	The dependence of binding on loop sequence, the binding-induced change of 2-ap fluorescence when the fluorescent probe is in the hairpin but not in the stem, and the conformational changes within the loop revealed by Mg 2+-mediated cleavage indicate that the binding site for the compounds identified in this study includes the loop.
19561197:74	A small molecule that binds to a miRNA precursor might also interfere with endogenous factors that interact with the hairpin loop to stimulate cleavage by Drosha or with processing steps that follow Drosha cleavage, including removal of the loop or intracellular localization.
19561197:75	In any of these cases, a compound that specifically interferes with maturation of miR-21 will be a useful tool for understanding miRNA regulation and could be of therapeutic value.

19829818:0	Introduction 
Hepatic foreign bodies are quite rare.
19829818:1	A sewing needle (SN) as a hepatic foreign body in an old woman is very rare.
19829818:2	The managements have been varied.
19829818:3	Herein, we report a 76-year-old woman with a SN in her liver, which was incidentally found on abdominal X-ray during hospitalization for treatment of anemia.
19829818:4	Case presentation 
A 76-year-old woman was hospitalized due to the complaint of fatigue.
19829818:5	On evaluation, she was found to have anemia.
19829818:6	Full blood count revealed the following findings: red blood cell count, 2.33 × 10 12/L; hemoglobin, 76 g/L; mean corpuscular volume, 101.7 (normal: 80-100) fl; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 32.6 (normal: 27-34) pg; reticulocytes, 6.4%; white blood cell count, 6 × 10 9/L; and platelets, 371 × 10 9/L.
19829818:7	The patient was found to have a serum iron content of 6.4 (normal: 7-32) μmol/L and unsaturated iron binding capacity of 56.1 (normal: 31-51) μmol/L.
19829818:8	Liver and kidney function tests were normal.
19829818:9	Abdominal x-ray incidentally revealed a metal needle in her superior abdominal area.
19829818:10	She had no history of inadvertently swallowing a metal needle and no history of abdominal operation but she recalled that she was acupunctured by a witch doctor because of epigastric pain more than twenty years ago.
19829818:11	She was not aware that a needle was left in her body.
19829818:12	She had not had epigastric pain for many years.
19829818:13	Ultrasound examination showed a 3.5 cm long, needle-like, metal object in the left lobar of the liver ( : Panels A and B).
19829818:14	Computerized tomographic scan validated the metal object as a SN ( : Panels C and D).
19829818:15	She was diagnosed with nutritional anemia and a SN in the liver.
19829818:16	After supplement of iron, vitamin B12, and folacin, her haemoglobin was recovered to a near normal level (92 g/L).
19829818:17	She was discharged without removal of the needle because the needle had been in her body for many years, without harm to her health.
19829818:18	The needle was kept stable in her liver after two years of follow-up.
19829818:19	Discussion 
SN as a foreign body in the liver is rare, so far only 11 cases have been reported in English literature [ - ].
19829818:20	The patients have been psychiatric cases , a pediatric population , or ordinary adults [ , ] that accidentally swallowed a foreign object.
19829818:21	Among them, five cases were children under 14 years old [ , , ].
19829818:22	In the six cases of adult patients, five cases were women, which might be attributed to a SN being used more often by a woman than a man.
19829818:23	The way by which the SN enters into liver may be transcutaneous, but in 9 of 11 cases reviewed, the SNs migrated to liver through the gastrointestinal tract after the SNs were, inadvertently [ - ] or intentionally , ingested.
19829818:24	The two patients with a SN transcutaneously entering the liver had no clear history.
19829818:25	The entering pathway was confirmed by operation in one case , and the other had the habit of sticking needles into her body , which suggested the needle penetrated into liver transcutaneously.
19829818:26	The patients with a SN in the liver usually have no obvious symptoms except mild epigastric pain which is often neglected.
19829818:27	Only two of the eleven cases reviewed were complicated with hepatic abscess, which was secondary to the SNs, migrated from the alimentary tract.
19829818:28	The clinical picture in these cases included fever with chills and rigors, abdominal pain, vomiting, and jaundice, and patients needed to be treated with surgical drainage . In most cases, the SN in the liver was incidentally detected by X-ray during medical examination.
19829818:29	The management of a SN depends on its location, progression, and existence of any complication.
19829818:30	Retrieval methods of a SN include laparotomy [ , , ] and laparoscopy [ , ].
19829818:31	In most cases (8/11), the SN was surgically removed to avoid complication.
19829818:32	Asymptomatic patients without complication need not be treated with immediate operation, but the patient should be followed up.
19829818:33	If the SN is stable in the liver without movement, the needle need not be retrieved . 
The current patient did not know when the sewing entered into her liver, which was incidentally found and presented no symptoms.
19829818:34	The SN remained stable in the liver after two years of follow-up, so was not removed.
19829818:35	Conclusion 
A SN as a foreign body in the liver is rare.
19829818:36	In general, the SN should be removed through laparotomy or laparoscopy, but stable and uncomplicated SN in the liver need not be removed.

RESULTS 
Sonographic visualization and measurement of the fetal gall bladder was possible at as early as 12 weeks gestation.
18253076:1	Our study population consisted of 1,911 of the 2,170 fetuses enrolled in this study (88.1%) that produced results meeting the acceptable criteria.
18253076:2	Of these, the gall bladders of 1,417 fetuses (74.1%) were visualized using antenatal sonography.
18253076:3	Visualization of the gall bladder was achieved in greater than 90% of women at gestation periods between 16 and 34 weeks, however the gall bladder was identified in less than 90% of study population after 35 weeks.
18253076:4	Measurements of the length, width, and height of the fetal gall bladder were obtained from 1,292 of 1,417 fetuses (91.2%), however the scanning plane could not be adjusted to depict the maximal length, width, or height of the gall bladder in the remaining 125 fetuses.
18253076:5	shows fetal gall bladder length, height, width, area and volume according to gestational age.
18253076:6	The measured parameters of the fetal gall bladder had a significant positive relationship with gestational age.
18253076:7	The correlation of length and area to gestational age was better than that of width, height, and volume, therefore, reference values based on the gestational age were only calculated for the length and area.
18253076:8	The median values of the gall bladder lengths in the Korean population were not significantly different from those in the Caucasian and African-American populations ( p = 0.915).
18253076:9	The mean differences, repeatability coefficients, and coefficients of variation between the two operators were 1.85 ± 2.84 mm (mean ± SD), 5.56 mm, and 12.9% for the length, 0.56 ± 1.14 mm, 2.23 mm, and 21.0% for the width, 0.25 ± 0.83 mm, 1.63 mm, and 16.6% for the height, 125.66 ± 175.56 mm 2, 344.11 mm 2, and 33.52% for the area, and 110.07 ± 217.54 mm 3, 426.37 mm 3, 97.36% for the volume.
18253076:10	DISCUSSION 
It has been demonstrated that growth of fetal organs varies between ethnicities, even when environmental and socio-economic factors are considered ( - ).
18253076:11	The fetal gall bladder can commonly be seen as a fluid filled structure during antenatal sonography and the normative data of the fetal gall bladder throughout gestation has been established in Caucasian and African-American populations ( - ).
18253076:12	The application of those normative data may be inappropriate for evaluation of the fetal gall bladder in other populations, however, if ethnic differences between populations have not been compared.
18253076:13	In our larger study of 1,911 fetuses, we provided reference values for the growth of the fetal gall bladder throughout gestation in the Korean population.
18253076:14	The lengths of the fetal gall bladder were not statistically different from those of the Caucasian and African-American populations, which suggests that there is no need to consider ethnicity when interpreting the size of fetal gall bladder in Asian, African-American and Caucasian populations.
18253076:15	Some investigators have asserted that the fetal gall bladder can always be observed after the early part of the second trimester, therefore non-visualization of the fetal gall bladder after this point may indicate cystic fibrosis, gall bladder atresia, and biliary atresia ( - ).
18253076:16	Hertzberg et al. have refuted this assertion, however, in a study that assessed the prognostic importance of non-visualization of the gall bladder during gestation.
18253076:17	In their study, the fetal gall bladder was not seen in approximately 5% of fetuses at 24-32 weeks gestation, however a normal outcome occurred in most of the cases in which the gall bladder of the fetus could not be visualized.
18253076:18	In our study, the gall bladder was not seen in 84 (6.8%) fetuses at 16-34 weeks gestation, which is similar to the findings of Hetzberg et al.
18253076:19	Moreover, the visualization rate of the fetal gall bladder decreased in fetuses scanned after 35 weeks of gestation, which might be attributable to either technical difficulty or increased gall bladder contractility with advanced gestation.
18253076:20	Therefore, our findings support Hertzberg's opinion that the rate of non-visualization of the fetal gall bladder is sufficiently high, indicating that non-visualization of the gall bladder may not be a useful screen for fetal anomalies such as biliary atresia.
18253076:21	It should be noted that our study was limited because it lacked a true reference standard for validating normal neonatal outcomes in the study population.
18253076:22	While we excluded all fetuses with abnormalities that were believed to have a potential influence on the normality of the fetal gall bladder, we cannot be completely certain that this exclusion was effective.
18253076:23	However, we believe that such a limitation is unavoidable when conducting prenatal imaging research to provide reference values for the general population.
18253076:24	Another limitation of this study is that the analysis of interobserver variability used a relatively low number of women and intraobserver variability was not analyzed.
18253076:25	Although each observer performed the measurement twice, it was performed without appropriate time intervals between two measurements, and thus intraobserver variability could not be analyzed.
18253076:26	In summary, we have provided reference values of the fetal gall bladder throughout gestation in the Korean population.
18253076:27	As shown in our study, the reference values of the fetal gall bladder in the Korean population are not statistically different from those of the Caucasian and African-American populations, and non-visualization of the fetal gall bladder is a relatively common finding with little clinical significance as a sign of fetal abnormality.
21097884:0	INTRODUCTION 
DNA replication progression can be stalled by a variety of DNA lesions or by anomalous DNA secondary structures.
21097884:1	Disintegration of DNA replication forks may lead to cell death or genome rearrangements that are responsible for cancer and other genetic diseases.
21097884:2	The effects of DNA lesions on replication fork progression vary significantly depending on which DNA strand these lesions are formed on.
21097884:3	Lesions on the lagging DNA strand template can be skipped over and new Okazaki fragments re-initiated downstream of the lesion allowing the lesion to be repaired after completion of DNA replication.
21097884:4	In contrast, lesions on the leading DNA strand template are more likely to block the replication fork progression.
21097884:5	In response to this threat, DNA damage tolerance pathways have evolved to enable DNA polymerase to bypass lesions on the leading DNA strand template.
21097884:6	Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two major pathways responsible for DNA lesion bypass: the system of post replication repair (PRR) and homologous recombination (HR) encoded by the Rad6/Rad18 and the Rad52 epistasis groups, respectively.
21097884:7	In addition, as recent data indicate, lesion bypass can occur by re-initiation of the leading strand synthesis downstream of a lesion that blocks replication fork progression.
21097884:8	HR plays an important role in both the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and in DNA lesion bypass.
21097884:9	The mechanisms of DSB repair have been intensively investigated during the recent decade.
21097884:10	It was found that DSBs are first exonucleolytically processed to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that are targeted by HR enzymes including Rad51 and several auxiliary proteins.
21097884:11	Rad51 possesses DNA strand exchange activity that is thought to be critically important for DSB repair.
21097884:12	Rad51 promotes a search for homologous sequences and then DNA strand exchange to form Joint Molecules (D-loops) that serve as a template for DSB repair.
21097884:13	Rad54, a member of the Snf2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases, stimulates Rad51 DNA strand exchange activity.
21097884:14	Rad54 also performs several additional functions; it translocates on dsDNA in an ATPase-dependent manner, as well as promotes chromatin remodeling, Rad51 displacement from dsDNA, and branch migration of Holliday junctions.
21097884:15	Stalling of the replication fork at a lesion on the leading strand template results in uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis; DNA synthesis continues only on the undamaged lagging template strand generating ssDNA gaps that may activate HR.
21097884:16	Similar to DSBs, stalled replication forks can be repaired through a mechanism that relies on Rad51 DNA strand exchange activity [reviewed in ref.].
21097884:17	Rad51 promotes invasion of the ssDNA gap into homologous sister chromatids, forming a joint molecule that is used as a template for DNA repair synthesis followed by restoration of replication forks through endonucleolytic resolution of the recombination intermediates.
21097884:18	Alternatively, it was suggested that DNA lesion bypass can occur through the template strand switch mechanism [reviewed in ref.].
21097884:19	This mechanism includes conversion of the fork to a Holliday junction (known as the ‘chicken foot’ structure) by branch migration.
21097884:20	In the chicken foot structure, an elongated lagging strand provides a template for extension of the leading strand beyond the point of the replication block on the parental template.
21097884:21	After extension of the leading strand by DNA polymerase, the chicken foot structure can be reset by reverse branch migration into the fork, in which the lesion is bypassed.
21097884:22	In Escherichia coli HR proteins RecG, RuvABC and RecA catalyze fork regression, restoration and Holliday junction resolution.
21097884:23	In humans, RecQ helicaes, WRN, BLM, and RecQ5β, and a Fanconi anemia protein, FANCM, promote conversion of a replication fork to the ‘chicken foot’ structure in vitro.
21097884:24	Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad5, a member of the Rad6/Rad18 pathway, and its human ortholog HLTF is also capable of promoting regression of a model replication fork.
21097884:25	We previously showed that Rad54 protein promotes branch migration of Holliday junctions ( , ).
21097884:26	Here we investigated the ability of human RAD54 to promote regression of model replication forks in vitro . Our results show that RAD54 protein promotes both regression and restoration of model stalled replication forks.
21097884:27	However, RAD54 showed a strong preference for fork restoration, as only a small amount of the chicken foot accumulated under equilibrium conditions.
21097884:28	We then found that RAD51 specifically stimulates RAD54 in such a way that that it changes the equilibrium toward accumulation of the chicken foot structure.
21097884:29	Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAD51-mediated accumulation of the chicken foot structure is essential for DNA lesion bypass by DNA polymerase in vitro . These data indicate that RAD51 may have a new role in DNA lesion bypass that is distinct from DNA strand invasion.
21097884:30	Our current results suggest that RAD54 and RAD51 by acting together may promote error-free lesion bypass through the template switch mechanism.
21097884:31	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Results 
Discussion 
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of DNA lesion bypass by DNA polymerase through the template switch mechanism promoted by the RAD54 and RAD51 proteins.
21097884:32	RAD54, a DNA branch migration protein, is capable of both promoting regression and restoration of a model replication fork.
21097884:33	Importantly, RAD51, by shifting the equilibrium in this process toward the fork regression, increases the efficiency of DNA lesion bypass by DNA polymerase.
21097884:34	Multiple DNA repair systems have evolved to remove DNA lesions prior to genome replication.
21097884:35	Nevertheless, at every cycle of DNA replication the DNA polymerase encounters unrepaired lesions that may block replication fork progression.
21097884:36	Genetic data indicate that replication forks can bypass DNA lesions in the process known as DNA damage tolerance.
21097884:37	In eukaryotes, DNA damage tolerance is carried out by HR and Rad6/Rad18 pathway.
21097884:38	Several models have been proposed to explain how HR can promote DNA lesion bypass.
21097884:39	In these models, the daughter-strand gaps resulted from replication fork blocks or ssDNA tails produced by the cleavage of stalled replication forks by structure-specific nucleases, e.g. Mus81 ( , ), can be repaired through joint molecule formation with the undamaged sister chromatid, in a process that depends on DNA strand exchange activity of Rad51 ( A and B).
21097884:40	However, recent studies underscore the importance of the branch migration activity of HR proteins in DNA repair.
21097884:41	While DNA strand exchange activity is pivotal to the function of HR, our current data demonstrate that the concerted action of RAD51 and RAD54 provides an alternative means for DNA lesion bypass by DNA polymerase via the template strand switch mechanism ( C).
21097884:42	In addition to Rad54, several eukaryotic proteins have been reported recently to promote branch migration of Holliday junctions or Holliday junction-like structures including model replication forks in vitro . In humans, these proteins include members of the RecQ helicase family, WRN, BLM, and RecQ5β, and a Fanconi anemia helicase FANCM.
21097884:43	S. cerevisiae Rad5, a member of the Rad6/Rad18 pathway, and its human ortholog HLTF is also capable of promoting regression of a model replication fork.
21097884:44	Recent data indicate multiple and non-redundant functions of these proteins, e.g. RAD54 and BLM, in mammalian cells.
21097884:45	Further experiments are needed to better understand the specific functions of these branch migration proteins in DNA damage tolerance.
21097884:46	However, our current results demonstrate that branch migration activity alone is necessary, but not sufficient to generate chicken fork structures in amounts required for an efficient DNA lesion bypass through the template-strand switch mechanism, as both RAD54 and BLM show a strong bias toward fork restoration.
21097884:47	Similarly, in protein-independent reaction the equilibrium is also shifted toward the replication fork.
21097884:48	In our experiments, RAD51 specifically stimulates the regression of replication forks by RAD54 and inhibits reverse regression of the resulting chicken foot structure to the replication fork.
21097884:49	Such an arrangement is required to achieve DNA lesion bypass by DNA polymerase.
21097884:50	The mechanism of this selectivity of RAD51 remains to be investigated.
21097884:51	However, the specific interaction between RAD51 and RAD54 plays a central role in this selectivity, as RAD51 does not stimulate a BLM-dependent fork regression.
21097884:52	The ability of RAD51 to bind ssDNA–dsDNA junctions may stimulate RAD54 loading onto the fork junction promoting its conversion into the chicken-fork structure.
21097884:53	In contrast, such stimulation of loading may not occur with the chicken foot structure, as the ssDNA region in this structure is not adjacent to the junction.
21097884:54	Consequently, RAD51 stimulates only RAD54-dependent fork regression, but not fork restoration.
21097884:55	Thus, while many proteins that possess branch migration activity could likely promote both replication fork regression and restoration, a specific bias toward fork regression of branch migration enzymes or their auxiliary protein partners seems to be especially important for stimulation of lesion bypass by DNA polymerase.
21097884:56	In addition to protein factors, the propensity of the chicken foot structure formation could also be increased by positive supercoiling in DNA at the replication fork, however the supercoil status of stalled replication forks is currently unknown.
21097884:57	Recently, it was demonstrated that in mammalian cells RAD51 has distinct early and late roles in the repair of hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks.
21097884:58	It was suggested that while at the late stage RAD51 mediates the repair of collapsed forks through the canonical ssDNA invasion mechanism, at the early step it promotes DNA lesion bypass through formation of the chicken fork structure.
21097884:59	Our current biochemical study provides a strong support for this early role of RAD51; it indeed can promote formation of the chicken foot structure in vitro by acting together with RAD54 branch migration protein.
21097884:60	Also, formation Rad51-dependent Holliday junctions was previously observed in sgs1 yeast cells during replication on the MMS-damaged DNA, although the molecular mechanism is unknown.
21097884:61	Overall, previous and our current data suggest RAD51 and RAD54 proteins may be involved in stalled replication fork restart by three different mechanisms, which can be used depending on a particular type of DNA lesion or availability of other supplementary enzymes.
21097884:62	First, RAD51 and RAD54 may participate in the repair of lagging (not shown) or leading strand template lesion ( A) by promoting DNA strand exchange between ssDNA gap in the daughter strand and homologous sister chromatid.
21097884:63	Second, both proteins may also be required for the repair of a stalled fork that was first cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases following DNA double strand processing by exonucleases ( B).
21097884:64	In this case, RAD51 and RAD54 promote D-loop formation, and later catalyse branch migration of Holliday junctions that are resolved by structure-specific nucleases to restore the replication fork.
21097884:65	Finally, our current results suggest that RAD54, in coordination with RAD51, provides lesion bypass through the DNA template switch mechanism that involves fork regression and restoration ( C).

19860739:0	Introduction 
SBS (short bowel syndrome) is a dreaded condition of nutritional malabsorption related to the surgical removal or disease of a large portion of the small intestine (loss of more than 70%) . Improving the nutritional status of the patients by EN (enteral) and PN (parenteral) feeding has been used as a life-saving treatment for patients with intestinal failure.
19860739:1	The high costs and high mortality  associated with PN feeding further emphasize the need for a more definitive treatment for SBS.
19860739:2	Attempts have been made to treat SBS by surgical procedures like sequential intestinal loop lengthening, but with little success . For patients dependent on PN feeding, intestinal transplantation remains the most promising treatment in the present medical field.
19860739:3	However, patient survival rates are poor ; there are high incidences of rejection and limited availability of donor organs.
19860739:4	There have been attempts to engineer the small intestine since 1998 and it has the potential to be a clinically viable option for those suffering from SBS in the future . We have highlighted the major advances made so far in this field .
19860739:5	The development of a tissue-engineered intestine requires overcoming obstacles in developing epithelial growth and differentiation on top of a vascularized subepithelial matrix as well as developing an innervated muscular layer.
19860739:6	Choi and Vacanti  have employed rat intestine epithelial organoid units  as a cell source to be seeded on to porous synthetic biodegradable polymer scaffolds made of PGA (polyglycolic acid) or copolymer PLGA [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)] and have achieved considerable success in regenerating neointestinal tissue.
19860739:7	Despite the demonstrated success of Choi and Vacanti  in rat models, there does not appear to be a concrete way forward for the employment of this technique in humans.
19860739:8	There are many questions that remain unanswered and several difficulties to overcome.
19860739:9	First, it is unclear whether the absorptive capacity is improved through the anastomosed segment of a tissue-engineered small intestine because of added mucosal surface area or because of slow transit.
19860739:10	Secondly, the entire intestinal length of 40 neonatal rats was required to make organoid unit-polymer constructs sufficient to implant in 10 adult rats.
19860739:11	The question of availability of human neonatal intestine in such large amounts is likely to be one of the major limiting factors in developing this procedure clinically.
19860739:12	Finally, the immunocompatibility is not going to be any better than the transplant procedure.
19860739:13	It would appear that the entire concept of small intestinal tissue engineering needs a fresh impetus to progress.
19860739:14	One field currently of great interest in tissue engineering is the potential use of human stem cells . Stem cells from peripheral blood, if they can be cued towards intestinal lineage, could prove to be a holy grail in the development of a successful procedure.
19860739:15	A better understanding of cell–cell and cell–ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions, specific stem cell markers and trophic growth factors is required . So far, only PLGA or PGA alone has been predominantly experimented for small intestinal tissue engineering .
19860739:16	One area in which a fresh perspective may be achieved is by looking at other potential scaffolds such as a relatively new biodegradable nanocomposite developed by incorporating the biostable POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) nanocages into a poly(caprolactone/carbonate)urethane urea . Nanocomposites can be defined as multiphase solid materials where one of the phases has a dimension of less than 100 nm . POSS molecules are 6 nm in size.
19860739:17	Studies on the biodegradation of this polymer have been carried out previously . These studies showed that the incorporation of POSS nanocomposites into the poly(caprolactone/carbonate)urethane/urea resulted in the development of a degradable polymer that preserves its mechanical properties as it undergoes oxidation, hydrolysis or degradation by plasma protein fractions .
19860739:18	The nanocages provide a ‘shielding effect’ on the soft phase of the polymer.
19860739:19	PCL (polycaprolactone) is a degradable aliphatic polyester that has been extensively reported to demonstrate biocompatibility in vivo . Its degradation by hydrolysis and enzymes is well documented.
19860739:20	PCL has been used in several copolymers and polymer blends as the foundation for a tailor-made polymer with specific properties.
19860739:21	The in vivo host response of POSS–PCL has not been studied; however, POSS–PCU [poly(carbonate-urea)urethane], the non-biodegradable counterpart lacking PCL, made by the same group, was implanted in sheep for 36 months and showed only minimal inflammation as compared with silicone implants .
19860739:22	It is proposed that caprolactone will provide controlled degradation, whereas the POSS nanocages will contribute to the mechanical strength required for a tissue engineering scaffold for soft tissue such as the small intestine.
19860739:23	Our laboratory is investigating individually the two main components involved in small intestinal tissue engineering: scaffolds using nanocomposite (POSS–PCL) developed and patented by our group , and in another simultaneous study, trying to extract stem cells from peripheral blood and co-culturing them with intestinal myofibroblasts in order to differentiate them into IECs (intestinal epithelial cells).
19860739:24	The present paper describes our studies on the nanocomposite biodegradable polymer scaffold fabricated by us, examining its preparation, characterization, mechanical testing and in vitro cell culture results using a rat IEC cell line in order to optimize the scaffold conditions most suitable for small intestinal tissue engineering.
19860739:25	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Tissue engineering is based on the utilization of cells and biomaterials.
19860739:26	An ideal scaffold should be highly porous, and biocompatible with a controlled degradation rate; should have an appropriate surface for cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation; and should maintain proper mechanical properties.
19860739:27	Our laboratory has already demonstrated the advantages and the successful applications of silica nanocomposite-based polyurethanes in producing vascular tissue-engineered grafts, such as improved cell adhesion characteristics using a silicon pendant nanocage . In the present study, we assessed whether similar, although biodegradable, nanocomposite POSS–PCL was safe and compatible with in vitro cell cultures when IECs were employed.
19860739:28	As this was intended as a study of cytocompatibility, it was felt that it was reasonable to use a rat intestinal cell line rather than employ primary rat intestinal cells for which a large number of rats would have been required to obtain an adequate number of cells for the study.
19860739:29	Another aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of alternative biodegradable polymers like POSS–PCL for soft tissue engineering, as opposed to the widely accepted sole use of PGA/PLLA (poly- L-lactide acid) copolymers in small intestinal tissue engineering.
19860739:30	PCL has the potential advantages of being less expensive and dissolves more readily in commonly available organic solvents when compared with PGA (which is very hard in consistency and requires the use of highly fluorinated solvents such as hexafluoroisopropanol).
19860739:31	The nanocomposite fabricated by us maintains mechanical stability due to the presence of nanocages while simultaneously allowing controlled degradation.
19860739:32	The present study employed two different pore size ranges (150–250 μm and <100 μm) and investigated two porosities (one over the range of 80% and the other over the range of 40%).
19860739:33	By utilizing solvent casting and salt leaching, production of scaffolds with pore size and porosity in the desired range was successfully achieved.
19860739:34	The pores were interconnected as can be seen from SEM and micro-CT.
19860739:35	The mechanical properties as well as the suitability of cell growth on the scaffolds produced were then examined.
19860739:36	When tested for stress–strain relationships the results obtained show that the strength of the scaffold decreases with an increase in porosity.
19860739:37	In the present study, the approximate cell size of the IECs was much smaller than the organoid unit employed in the previously mentioned rat studies.
19860739:38	IEC proliferation was followed for 21 days on scaffolds made of high and low porosities and large and small pore sizes.
19860739:39	All the samples examined were able to support both initial cell seeding and prolonged cell growth over the course of the 21 days investigated.
19860739:40	In our preliminary experiments, as the scaffold had not been washed adequately, they failed to show any cell attachment or growth (results not shown).
19860739:41	The washing regime was initially to just rinse the scaffolds in deionized water.
19860739:42	This was then made more stringent by rinsing the scaffolds for 72 h on a shaker with changes of water every 4 h.
19860739:43	It is believed that DMAC or the residual salt levels used in scaffold preparation could be cytotoxic if not removed completely.
19860739:44	Studies of LDH levels showed that there was little initial cell damage.
19860739:45	There was no significant difference in cell seeding or growth between any of the samples investigated.
19860739:46	These findings were confirmed by the SEM studies, which showed that cells were present in all samples on day 21.
19860739:47	The potential of the POSS–PCL scaffold to support cell seeding and growth was therefore confirmed.
19860739:48	Conclusion 
In the present study, a simple and inexpensive method of solvent casting and particulate leaching was employed to fabricate porous scaffolds using a newly developed nanocomposite of silsesquixane-based PCL (POSS–PCL).
19860739:49	We showed that these scaffolds carry physical and chemical properties for intestinal cells to remain viable within the culture medium exposed to POSS–PCL, adhere to the polymer surface, remain viable and achieve confluence on the scaffold.
19860739:50	This in vitro study for tissue engineering of the small intestine provides the option of using an alternative polymer to the conventionally used PGA or polylactide.
19860739:51	The pore size and porosity of scaffolds should be tailor-made depending on the type and size of the cell source.

19435529:0	Background 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs (~20–22 nucleotides) that have critical functions in various biological processes . These naturally occurring miRNAs function by binding to target mRNAs, resulting in the degradation or translational inhibition of the mRNA, based upon the degree of complementarity with it.
19435529:1	First described in 1993 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , to date, thousands of miRNAs have been cloned in higher eukaryotes and a number have been shown to play a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, growth and morphogenesis [ - ].
19435529:2	At present, dysregulation of miRNAs has been shown to be involved in tumor initiation and progression.
19435529:3	The explosion of data on miRNAs and cancer has put them in the spotlight over the past few years.
19435529:4	Numerous studies have highlighted the suspected role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and have established that profiling of these miRNAs represents an informative method for determining developmental lineage and the differentiation state of various malignancies.
19435529:5	The initial connection of miRNAs and cancer was elucidated in leukemia and hematological malignancies, later spurring interest in solid malignancies.
19435529:6	For example, one of the first lines of evidence for direct involvement of miRNAs in cancer was the finding that miR-15 and miR-16 are located within a 30 kb deletion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and that both genes were deleted or underexpressed in most cases of this cancer . Abnormal expression of microRNAs has been found in a variety of solid tumors, including colon, breast, lung, thyroid, glioblastomas, prostate, lymphomas, ovarian, hepatocellular, cervical, and pancreatic carcinomas [ - ].
19435529:7	Comparatively, oral cancer has received very little attention in this area of genome profiling.
19435529:8	It is identified as a significant public health threat worldwide because its treatment often produces dysfunction and distortions in speech, mastication and swallowing, dental health, and even in the ability to interact socially.
19435529:9	It is one of the 10 most frequent cancers in human males worldwide, with about two thirds of all cases occurring in developing countries . The most common type of oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma.
19435529:10	At present, the management of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) includes combinations of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy . Despite improvements in these therapies, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly and remains at about 50% . In clinical practice, treatment planning and prognosis for patients with OSCC are mainly based on the TNM classification.
19435529:11	TNM classification provides significant diagnostic information concerning the tumor, but does not give the clinician sufficient therapeutic biological information, such as the metastatic potential or the sensitivity or resistance of the tumor to radiotherapy and chemotherapy . There is an urgent need for diagnostic methods for distinguishing high-risk patients from other patients in order that optimal managements can be applied.
19435529:12	As such, some of the urgent priorities in this field are the need to identify and elucidate novel genes or pathways that may choreograph this disease.
19435529:13	In the present study, by using the miRNA microarray technique, we have measured the relative expression of microRNAs in 7,12-dimethyl-benz- [ a ]-anthrance (DMBA)-induced OSCC in Syrian hamster.
19435529:14	We hope that it can contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of this malignancy.
19435529:15	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Since Sally first established the DMBA-induced oral carcinogenesis model in the cheek pouch of Syrian hamster in 1954, it has become a classic animal model of OSCC . In this study, we successfully constructed this animal model of OSCC using tri-weekly applications of a 5% solution of DMBA in acetone onto the cheek pouch of Syrian hamsters over about a 12-week period.
19435529:16	For models like the hamster model for OSCC, microarray assay provides a powerful tool for analyzing both miRNA expression patterns and quantitative expression levels, as it profiles thousands of genes simultaneously.
19435529:17	This technology is much more efficient than the now outmoded and time-consuming methods used in earlier work, and is becoming the broadest miRNA research tool available . We used a newly designed microarray platform specific for the analysis of the expression of some 924 mammalian miRNAs.
19435529:18	The platform and assay are similar in many respects to other spotted oligonucleotide microarray designs, but have several important differences in application . First, a modified spotting buffer and an advanced hybridization system were used in this study.
19435529:19	These measures have both previously shown to result in large improvements in the local signal intensity and global signal uniformity, as well as in the elimination of the doughnut spots commonly seen on spotted oligonucleotide arrays.
19435529:20	These improvements are believed to be due to better blocking of the slide surface chemistry . A detailed assessment of the quality control and reproducibility of this new miRNA microarray platform has been published .
19435529:21	Using miRNA microarray analysis, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles of OSCC and normal cheek mucosa tissues, and identified seventeen miRNAs that were up-regulated and down-regulated in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues.
19435529:22	In addition, hsa-miR-338, mmu-miR-762, and mmu-miR-126-5p were not apparently altered in any of the tumors.
19435529:23	Recently, there have been several studies regarding miRNA expression profiles of various tumor types and the general finding was that overall microRNA expression could differentiate normal versus cancerous tissues [ - ].
19435529:24	Among these previous studies, some miRNAs expression levels were similar to those found in the present study.
19435529:25	These results are summarized in Table . Lu et al. has demonstrated the use of microRNA signatures as an important advance in cancer diagnosis.
19435529:26	Their work indicated that microRNA-based identification of cancers was superior in terms of correctly diagnosing cancer of unknown primaries when compared to mRNA classification . 
Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in recent years and miRNA functional identification has become one of the most active research fields in biology.
19435529:27	However, only a limited number of miRNAs has yet been defined functionally through overexpression, misexpression, and in vitro knockdown . Recently, several studies have indicated that increased or decreased miRNA levels play a critical role in head and neck carcinogenesis.
19435529:28	Using miRNA microarray analysis, Chang et al. identified seven miRNAs that were up-regulated (mir-21, let-7, 18, 29c, 142-3p, 155, and 146b) and one miRNA that was down-regulated (mir-494) in HNSCC primary tissue and cell lines.
19435529:29	Moreover, they demonstrated that cytochrome c release was decreased by mir-21 knockdown, which suggested mir-21 inhibited several mRNAs that then led to a cascade of events that prevented apoptosis and increased cellular proliferation . In addition, Tran et al. identified 54 commonly expressed miRNA genes, which included 31 up-regulated and 23 down-regulated miRNAs.
19435529:30	The profiling data represented nine cell lines from four different anatomical head and neck sites . In comparison to these previous studies, the expression tendency of four miRNAs (hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-200b, and hsa-miR-221) were found to be similar in our study.
19435529:31	The similarity in expression of hsa-miR-21 in previous and our studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and cancer cell lines is of particular interest.
19435529:32	These findings, in conjunction with our study, demonstrate that miR-21 may play a critical role in head and neck carcinogenesis.
19435529:33	This miRNA should therefore become a focus for the development of anti-microRNA preclinical therapeutic strategies for OSCC abrogation in the future.
19435529:34	Considering only the highly conserved microRNAs that were common in both humans and hamsters, we used the TargetScan program to check if the SAM-retrieved microRNAs were conservative types.
19435529:35	In addition to mmu-miR-762 and mmu-miR-126-5p, fifteen other microRNAs were found highly conserved in most vertebrates.
19435529:36	At present, mmu-miR-762 and mmu-miR-126-5p are not known to have been reported in any tumors.
19435529:37	Since miRNAs can function as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes, they provide a logical therapeutic target for cancer treatment . Modified anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) have been used by many groups to inhibit miRNAs with oncogenic properties.
19435529:38	For example, Chan et al. successfully applied 2'-O-methyl- and DNA/LNA-mixed oligonucleotides to specifically knockdown miR-21, in order to investigate the potential contribution of this miRNA in the regulation of apoptosis-associated genes in glioblastoma cell lines . Thus, to supplement and/or enhance the function of tumor suppressor miRNAs due to a deletion or a loss of function mutation, a therapeutic approach could entail exogenous delivery of corrective synthetic miRNAs in the form of double-stranded miRNA mimics . Takamizawa et al. found that enforced expression of let-7 in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro .
19435529:39	This holds promise that let-7 may be useful in treatment of lung cancer or in enhancing currently available treatments . The microRNA field is rapidly developing, and the functions and signaling pathways of increasingly greater numbers of miRNAs are being carefully studied.
19435529:40	The activation or silencing of miRNAs identified in the present study and in previous studies could prove pivotal in the design of therapeutic strategies for OSCC treatment in the future, although we are presently far from that point.
19435529:41	Conclusion 
In summary, the specific miRNA expression levels identified by our study were similar with those reported in other studies, and suggested that a number of miRNAs could be significant in OSCC development.
19435529:42	The next step will be to perform functional research of the three microRNAs (hsa-miR-338, mmu-miR-762, and mmu-miR-126-5p) that were not found to have been altered in any malignancies.

18497715:0	ABSTINENCE INITIATION 
Cocaine withdrawal symptoms, including dysphoric mood, fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite changes, and irritability, contribute to many dependent patients’ difficulties quitting the drug.
18497715:1	Several studies have demonstrated that patients who experience severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA), are twice as likely to drop out of treatment and less likely to attain abstinence in outpatient programs.
18497715:2	An apparent clinical basis for these associations is that patients who are subject to severe symptoms may keep taking the drug to avoid them.
18497715:3	Investigators also have noted that these individuals report more intense highs from experimentally administered cocaine ( ; ) and therefore may experience greater drive to keep taking it.
18497715:4	RELAPSE PREVENTION 
Once cocaine-dependent patients have attained a period of abstinence, a more difficult phase of treatment, relapse prevention, begins.
18497715:5	Pharmacological strategies for relapse prevention aim to block cocaine-induced euphoria or reduce cocaine craving.
18497715:6	New insights into the effects of cocaine on the brain reward system have led to the identification of several promising medications.
18497715:7	Cocaine causes euphoria and reinforcement by raising dopamine levels in the mesocortical reward system.
18497715:8	One potential way to counterbalance this effect is to elevate mesocortical levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that pushes dopamine levels downward by inhibiting the activity of dopaminergic (dopamine-releasing) neurons.
18497715:9	Preclinical trials have suggested that GABAergic compounds (i.e., compounds that promote GABA release or conservation) blunt the dopamine response to cocaine administration and conditioned reminders of prior cocaine use and reduce self-administration of cocaine in animal models.
18497715:10	Accordingly, GABAergic medications are being tested as potential agents to prevent relapse by blocking cocaine-induced euphoria or reducing cue-induced craving caused by reminders of prior cocaine use.
18497715:11	Some promising GABAergic medications include gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG), tiagabine, and topiramate.
18497715:12	MEDICATIONS FOR AMPHETAMINE DEPENDENCE 
The search for medications to treat amphetamine and methamphetamine dependence started much more recently than that for cocaine treatment medications.
18497715:13	Consequently, fewer medications have been tested.
18497715:14	Similarities between the mechanisms of action of amphetamine and methamphetamine and those of cocaine suggest that the same medications may help with both dependencies.
18497715:15	Hence, several of the medications that have been discussed are undergoing, or about to undergo, testing for methamphetamine dependence.
18497715:16	For instance, trials of topiramate and modafinil are planned.
18497715:17	Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that is also effective in smoking cessation.
18497715:18	Bupropion’s efficacy for these uses rests upon its ability to support positive mood by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine into cells, leaving more of the neurotransmitter circulating in the mesolimbic system.
18497715:19	The same mechanism may be helpful in easing the negative mood symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal.
18497715:20	Although studies have shown bupropion to be ineffective in treating cocaine dependence, a recent clinical trial suggested that it may have promise for methamphetamine dependence.
18497715:21	Among 151 methamphetamine-dependent patients, bupropion recipients had somewhat better abstinence outcomes compared with placebo recipients; the difference approached, but did not quite achieve, statistical significance.
18497715:22	In a subgroup of patients whose methamphetamine use at baseline was less intensive, however, bupropion treatment was associated with significantly more weeks of abstinence (Elkashef et al., 2007).
18497715:23	Bupropion is fairly well-tolerated.
18497715:24	Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, dry mouth, and nausea.
18497715:25	This medication is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders, current or prior diagnoses of bulimia or anorexia nervosa, or concurrent treatment with (or within 14 days of discontinuation of) monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
18497715:26	Bupropion should not be used in patients detoxifying from alcohol or sedatives.
18497715:27	MEDICATIONS AND VOUCHER-BASED REINFORCEMENT THERAPY 
Voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT) is a behavioral treatment in which substance-dependent patients who achieve predetermined therapeutic goals receive vouchers redeemable for goods and services in the community.
18497715:28	VBRT has been shown to be highly effective for helping cocaine-dependent patients achieve initial abstinence.
18497715:29	Several recent trials have indicated that VBRT may be a highly effective psychosocial treatment platform for enhancing the efficacy of medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.
18497715:30	For example, gave desipramine, an antidepressant, or placebo with VBRT or a noncontingent voucher control to cocaine- and opiate-dependent patients who were being maintained on buprenorphine.
18497715:31	The patients given either desipramine or VBRT increased their frequency of urine samples containing no abused drug more rapidly than patients given neither, and those treated with both desipramine and VBRT produced the most such samples of any group.
18497715:32	These findings contrast with those of trials in the 1980s, which demonstrated that desipramine in combination with standard psychosocial treatment was ineffective in this population.
18497715:33	In another double-blind trial, bupropion plus VBRT was found to be superior to bupropion or VBRT alone, or placebo, in promoting abstinence from cocaine.
18497715:34	Similar results were reported for the combination of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) citalopram and VBRT.
18497715:35	Like desipramine, SRIs have not been found to be consistently efficacious for the treatment of cocaine dependence when used in association with standard psychosocial treatment.
18497715:36	The best way to integrate effective medications and psychotherapies into a comprehensive plan for the treatment of stimulant dependence has yet to be determined.
18497715:37	One can imagine a treatment course that begins with an abstinence initiation medication and contingency management, then switches to relapse prevention medications when the patient reaches some significant abstinence milestone.
18497715:38	Alternatively, a patient might continue to receive an abstinence initiation medication that is at some point supplemented with either a relapse prevention medication that is slowly titrated upward or with TA-CD immunization.
18497715:39	How long medication treatment should be continued is another unanswered question.
18497715:40	Studies to address these questions are being considered, but, for now, there are no data.
18497715:41	CONCLUSIONS 
Currently, no medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of stimulant dependence.
18497715:42	However, recent advances in understanding the processes involved in cocaine addiction have allowed researchers to identify several promising candidates.
18497715:43	Many of these medications have already shown promise in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, and virtually all of them are undergoing confirmatory testing.
18497715:44	Behavioral and psychosocial treatments, especially VBRT, may augment the efficacy of medication for the treatment of stimulant dependence.
18497715:45	Clinicians should be aware that all of the trials to date have been relatively small; therefore, the efficacy and safety of these medications have not been established definitively.
18497715:46	In addition, most of the trials have included primarily men; thus, efficacy in women is even less well-established.
18497715:47	Although no medications are currently proven to be effective, it is hoped that effective pharmacological treatments for stimulant dependence will soon become available.
21519551:0	Introduction 
The mammalian inner ear is a highly intricate organ composed of a cochlear duct and vestibular organs, responsible for hearing and balance, respectively.
21519551:1	The hair cells residing in each sensory organ of the inner ear play a primary role in sensory transduction by converting sound and balance information into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to their associated neurons to convey the signals to the brain.
21519551:2	In humans, these hair cells can easily be damaged by various causes including noise, drugs, aging, or genetic mutations.
21519551:3	The damage is irreversible in most cases, leading to permanent hearing loss . Thus far, efforts to preserve or regenerate hair cells using stem cells or gene therapy have met with only limited success [ - ].
21519551:4	A better understanding of normal hair cell development may help overcome such limitations.
21519551:5	Inner ear hair cells are formed via a series of cell fate decision and differentiation processes which are tightly regulated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors .
21519551:6	Among such factors, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Atoh1 (Atonal homolog, also known as Math1), has been shown to be a major determinant in hair cell differentiation.
21519551:7	In Atoh1 knockouts, both cochlear and vestibular hair cells failed to differentiate , while delivering the Atoh1 gene induced formation of ectopic hair cells in tissue cultures as well as animal models [ , ].
21519551:8	These results indicate a crucial role of Atoh1 in hair cell differentiation, yet how Atoh1 functions to dictate hair cell differentiation remains poorly understood.
21519551:9	In this study, to identify novel genes that play a role in hair cell differentiation, we analyzed an archived gene expression dataset, generated by extensive microarray analysis using mouse inner ear tissues at several embryonic stages .
21519551:10	Since Atoh1 plays a key role in hair cell differentiation , we assumed that genes involved in hair cell differentiation would be regulated directly or indirectly by Atoh1 and their expression patterns would be closely associated with that of Atoh1 during inner ear development.
21519551:11	For example, expression patterns of Gfi1 Pou4f3 and Myo7a which are important for hair cell differentiation, have been shown to resemble that of Atoh1 during inner ear development . We identified several genes that showed similar expression patterns to that of Atoh1 during inner ear development, some of which were confirmed as being specifically expressed in developing hair cells.
21519551:12	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
To identify novel genes playing a role in hair cell differentiation, we re-analyzed the gene expression dataset GSE7536  and searched for genes concordantly expressed with Atoh1 during hair cell differentiation.
21519551:13	As expected, the list includes many genes previously associated with inner ear development, hair cell differentiation or hereditary deafness.
21519551:14	For example, Myo6 Tecta and Tmprss3 have been associated with autosomal recessive or dominant deafness [ - ].
21519551:15	Also included were Atp6v1b1 and Slc26A4 which are involved in maintenance of pH and ion composition in the inner ear fluids . Several other genes, such as transcription factors Pou4f3 and Gfi1 extracellular matrix (tectorial membrane) components Tecta and Tectb and components of the Notch signaling pathway Hes5 and Jagged 2 were also included.
21519551:16	Interestingly, some genes known to be important for shaping the stereocilia of the hair cells such as Myo7a Cdh23 and Ush1c were identified as being concordantly expressed with Atoh1 only in the vestibular organs but not in the cochlea from the evaluated dataset.
21519551:17	This suggests that since the dataset used in this study covers expression profiles only up to E15 , the genes included in the dataset do not accurately represent gene expression changes in later stages (i.e., later than E15) and may not include some important genes involved in maturation of the hair cells, especially in the cochlea.
21519551:18	Thus, careful attention should be paid when comparing the genes identified from the vestibular organs and the cochlea.
21519551:19	From the list of genes concordantly expressed with Atoh1 we further excluded ones previously associated with inner ear as well as ones abundantly expressed in non-inner ear tissues to increase our chance to identify novel genes important for hair cell differentiation.
21519551:20	However, not all genes in the list were expressed in the hair cells but were in other parts of the inner ear such as cochleovestibular ganglion neurons, supporting cells, or mesenchyme-derived structures (data not shown).
21519551:21	This is because hair cell differentiation dictated by Atoh1 occurs in harmony with development of the entire inner ear as a whole.
21519551:22	Thus, specific expression domains in the developing inner ear should be carefully examined for each candidate.
21519551:23	As examples, we found that Smpx and Tekt2 were specifically expressed in the hair cells of developing inner ear.
21519551:24	Smpx encodes an 85-amino acid protein, which is associated with actin and focal adhesion complexes and functions as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics . The onset of Smpx expression in the developing hair cells appeared to be slightly later than Myo15, suggesting a possible role of Smpx in maturation or maintenance, rather than early specification, of hair cells.
21519551:25	Tekt2 encodes Tektin 2, also known as Tektin-t.
21519551:26	It has been shown that Tekt2 is expressed in sperm flagellum and the loss of Tekt2 leads to a defect in the dynein arms of flagellar axonemal microtubules, resulting in immotile sperm and male infertility [ , ].
21519551:27	Interestingly, male infertility is often associated with hearing loss, especially in patients suffering from primary ciliary dyskinesia .
21519551:28	Since our observation of Tekt2 expression in the developing hair cells suggests a possible role of Tekt2 in hair cell differentiation, especially in kinocilium mainly composed of microtubules, it will be interesting to examine whether the loss of Tekt2 causes hearing loss in addition to male infertility.
21519551:29	Taking advantage of gene expression profiles that are readily available in the GEO database , we identified several genes not previously associated with, yet possibly involved in hair cell differentiation.
21519551:30	Further investigation of the genes identified in this study will enhance our understanding of how the hair cells normally develop and function.
21176215:0	Background 
Experimental evidence suggests that SSRIs, a popular class of antidepressants, enhance breast cell proliferation during a relatively late phase in breast cancer development, either directly through SSRI tumour-promoting mechanisms [ - ] or indirectly through an SSRI-mediated increase in prolactin, a hormone for which there is increasing evidence to suggest an association with breast cancer . 
Previous epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between SSRI use and breast cancer were mainly conducted in the 1990's when the prevalence of SSRI use was low and therefore those studies were limited by a lack of subjects with prolonged use of SSRIs . As such, few epidemiologic studies have investigated the long-term safety of SSRIs or considered a latent effect of SSRI use on breast cancer risk.
21176215:1	In a review, Coogan  highlighted the 'dearth of data' related to long-term SSRI use and breast cancer risk and recommended further study.
21176215:2	Given that breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women  and that SSRIs have now been on the market for more than 20 years and are increasingly widely prescribed particularly in women, further investigation of the potential association between long-term SSRI use and breast cancer risk is warranted.
21176215:3	In this study, we evaluated the effects of duration of use, cumulative dose, and latency on breast cancer risk using a population-based case-control study.
21176215:4	Methods 
Results 
The study population consisted of 1,701 cases and 17,017 controls.
21176215:5	Cases were diagnosed at a mean age of 60.4 years (SD 11.5) and represented a homogeneous group with respect to morphology, with approximately 75% having infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 10% lobular carcinoma, and 15% with a mix of other morphologies.
21176215:6	There was more variability in relation to stage at diagnosis, with 44.9% of cases presenting as stage one, 35.3% stage two, 12.6% stage three, 4.5% stage four, 0.2% in situ and 2.5% unknown (stage could not be assessed).
21176215:7	The proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed each year was similar across the four-year accrual period.
21176215:8	Cases and controls were followed for an average of 28.4 years and were similar with regard to age, income support, and residence status (Table ).
21176215:9	However, cases were more likely than controls to be married and to have used hormone therapy and/or oral contraceptives.
21176215:10	Table shows the unadjusted and adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for breast cancer risk according to the number of SSRI prescriptions dispensed for all SSRIs combined during each of three exposure time windows of interest (two or more years, two to seven years and more than seven years prior to index date).
21176215:11	After adjustment for risk factors, women who had filled ≥36 prescriptions (estimated SSRI use of three or more years) in the time period two or more years prior to index date were not at increased risk of developing breast cancer compared to non-users (OR = 1.03, CI = 0.75 - 1.41).
21176215:12	Similarly, long-term use of SSRIs during the exposure time period two to seven years or more than seven years before the index date was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users (OR = 1.13, CI = 0.78 - 1.64, and OR = 0.80, CI = 0.49 - 1.29, respectively).
21176215:13	A shorter duration of use was also not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer regardless of the time period evaluated.
21176215:14	Compared with no use of SSRIs, higher total dosages (based on fluoxetine-equivalent dosages for all SSRIs combined) did not increase the risk of breast cancer during each exposure time window of interest, that is, two or more years prior to index date (OR = 0.91, CI = 0.64 - 1.28), two to seven years prior to index date (OR = 0.92, CI = 0.62 - 1.36) and use more than seven years prior to index date (OR = 1.02, CI = 0.67 - 1.55) (Table ).
21176215:15	Similarly, lower dosages were not associated with an increased risk in any time period assessed.
21176215:16	The pattern of risk observed with the use of individual SSRIs was similar to that for all SSRIs combined (Table and ).
21176215:17	Overall, there was no evidence of increased risk of breast cancer associated with 'any use' of individual SSRIs, regardless of the total number of prescriptions dispensed (Table ).
21176215:18	The small number of users of specific SSRIs did not permit an evaluation of risk associated with their use during the two shorter exposure windows.
21176215:19	The odds ratios for 'exclusive use' of high doses of paroxetine (OR = 1.20, CI = 0.64 - 2.25), sertraline (OR = 1.84, CI = 0.86 - 3.93) and fluvoxamine (OR = 1.33, CI = 0.47 - 3.77) failed to rule out the possibility of an increased risk; however, the number of exclusive users of any one agent was small and the corresponding confidence intervals very wide (Table ).
21176215:20	Discussion 
This large population-based case-control study utilized administrative health databases to assess SSRI use and breast cancer risk in relation to duration of use, cumulative dose and latency; critical considerations within the context of a carcinogenic hypothesis . Overall, SSRI use was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer regardless of our definition of cumulative use (total number of prescriptions dispensed and total dosage).
21176215:21	In addition, our results indicate that prolonged SSRI use does not have a latent effect on breast cancer risk.
21176215:22	Also, our findings are not suggestive of an increased risk of breast cancer with the use of individual SSRIs.
21176215:23	Our study improved upon most previous studies by having a longer follow-up period (subjects were followed for up to 18 years after initial SSRI exposure) and prospectively collected drug information that afforded precise and objective exposure definitions.
21176215:24	Further, few previous studies assessed risk associated with long-term use of SSRIs of comparable duration (that is, the equivalent of three or more years of use) or during specific exposure time windows that take latency into account.
21176215:25	However, despite these methodological improvements, our results are consistent with most other observational studies, including six that used self-reported SSRI exposure information [ - ], and four studies that ascertained SSRI use from a prescription database [ - ].
21176215:26	However, only three of these studies [ , ] had sufficient sample sizes to adequately evaluate risk associated with three or more years of combined SSRI use, and only one study  quantified total SSRI use with a dosage variable.
21176215:27	Haukka et al .  in a record-linkage study investigating cancer incidence at 19 sites in relation to the use of several antidepressants, reported an RR of 1.53 (CI = 1.14 - 2.05) for breast cancer for subjects with more than four years of SSRI use compared to non-users, adjusted for age and sex.
21176215:28	However, this result may be due to residual confounding or Type 1 error since more than 275 analyses were performed.
21176215:29	No previous peer-reviewed published studies have considered a delayed effect of SSRI exposure using similar time periods.
21176215:30	However, results from other studies that assessed the effect of timing of SSRI use on breast cancer risk using less precise measures of past SSRI use, such as 'time since first use' or 'time since last use' [ , ] or 'current' versus 'former' users [ - ] are consistent with our null findings.
21176215:31	Our findings of no increased risk of breast cancer for long-term use of individual SSRIs were consistent with most other observational studies that specifically assessed these relationships [ , - ], but contrary to a non-significant dose-response decrease in risk associated with increasing duration of paroxetine use reported by Wernli et al .  ( P -trend = 0.10).
21176215:32	Although the associations for 'exclusive use' of high doses of paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine were inconclusive, it is important to remember that the confidence intervals were wide and less than 1% of women in our study had used these agents exclusively for two years or more, suggesting that these results are likely not a source of concern.
21176215:33	The validity of our study is high for several reasons.
21176215:34	The Saskatchewan databases are recognized as valuable resources for drug utilization review and pharmacoepidemiologic studies  with built-in audit and eligibility checks and good cross database integrity for the conditions studied . The advantages of using a prescription database compared to self-reported SSRI use for drug exposure information include relatively easy access to large sample sizes and elimination of exposure recall error and bias [ , ].
21176215:35	In addition, with the use of detailed prescription database exposure histories, more precise SSRI exposure measures were calculated to represent duration and dosage of long-term use, allowing us to assess the latent effects of chronic long-term SSRI use more accurately.
21176215:36	Lack of selection bias is also a major strength of this study since there is virtually complete case ascertainment, and controls had a known and equal probability of being randomly selected from the same underlying population as the cases during the same time interval.
21176215:37	By focusing on assessing risk associated mainly with long-term SSRI use, it was anticipated that misclassification due to non-compliance (primarily overestimation of exposure) would more likely occur within the low exposure categories (one or two prescriptions filled), rather than in the contrast of most interest (for example, ≥36 prescriptions versus no exposure).
21176215:38	That is, if prescriptions were repeatedly refilled, we assume that they were more likely to be consumed.
21176215:39	Therefore, especially within the higher exposure group, misclassification of non-users of SSRIs as users would be less likely.
21176215:40	Further, non-compliance with dispensed medications would likely affect cases and controls equally in this study, leading to non-differential misclassification, if any.
21176215:41	The Saskatchewan prescription database lacked information on SSRI medications dispensed in hospitals or as samples from physicians .
21176215:42	Also, escitalopram, the newest SSRI to become available in Canada (since late 2005), was not included in the SK Drug Formulary at the time of data collection.
21176215:43	However, it was anticipated that the degree of potential misclassification (underestimation of exposure) associated with these additional sources of information bias would be uniform across the case and control groups.
21176215:44	Also, since the prescription database does not include information on the prescribed daily dosage regime, the total number of prescriptions dispensed was used to estimate duration of SSRI use based on the assumption that each prescription represented a 34-day supply.
21176215:45	To indirectly test the extent of misclassification related to estimating duration of exposure using number of prescriptions, risk was estimated for total dosage of combined SSRI use: none was detected, confirming that exposure classification errors in relation to using number of prescriptions were unlikely.
21176215:46	The SK databases did not contain information on some determinants of breast cancer including reproductive history, family history of breast cancer, anthropometric variables and lifestyle factors.
21176215:47	However, residual confounding is unlikely to be a concern in our study since previous studies of the SSRI-breast cancer association that have collected information on these factors have demonstrated that they are not a source of confounding bias [ , ].
21176215:48	In addition, we did not have information on prescription and over-the-counter use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some of which have been associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk.
21176215:49	If NSAIDs were used to a greater extent by SSRI users, then our risk estimates may have been affected by uncontrolled confounding.
21176215:50	However, we have no reason to believe that this was the case.
21176215:51	Given that SSRIs are mainly prescribed for the treatment of depression , and that there is a hypothesis that the risk of breast cancer may be increased with chronic depression , it may be contended that residual confounding by depression may have biased the results towards finding an association between long-term SSRI use and breast cancer.
21176215:52	However, since our results demonstrate no increased risk, this source of confounding "by indication" is of less concern.
21176215:53	Further, physician prescribing practices for SSRIs are unlikely to be biased by the presence of established risk factors for breast cancer, such as family history and reproductive factors, since an association between the use of SSRIs and breast cancer has not been firmly established.
21176215:54	Conclusions 
In conclusion, few epidemiologic studies have investigated the long-term safety of SSRIs or considered a latent effect of SSRI use on breast cancer risk.
21176215:55	Using precise and objective SSRI exposure measures of long-term use that took into account the duration, dosage and timing of SSRI use, our results do not indicate that the risk of breast cancer is increased with short- or long-term use of SSRIs or provide evidence of a latent effect of past SSRI use.
21176215:56	Given the potential health benefits of using SSRIs, our results have important implications within the realm of clinical medicine, suggesting that the issue of breast cancer risk may no longer be a concern for women requiring long-term use of SSRIs.

The UK Research Assessment Exercise reported in late 2008.
21385804:1	This was the sixth such national peer review evaluation of the quality of research carried out by higher education institutions, providing a quality rating for defined areas of research.
21385804:2	This rating, converted to a multiplication factor on volume measures such as numbers of staff and research students and amount of grant expenditure on peer review, determines the quality adjusted research funding to institutions.
21385804:3	In 2009-10, the Higher Education Funding Council for England allocated £1.6bn (€1.9bn; $2.6bn) in quality adjusted research to UK institutions that had collectively attracted £3.7bn in total research grants and contracts (2007-8) and £658m in income from charitable grants (2009-10).
21385804:4	In addition to providing an objective rationale for varying the allocation of resources to support research in institutions, the results of the Research Assessment Exercise are used for many secondary purposes, including rating the research environment for future external research awards.
21385804:5	The Research Assessment Exercise therefore generates a cycle of quality rating, being applied prospectively both directly through the block allocation for quality adjusted research and indirectly through its “kudos” score.
21385804:6	This may have had the effect of further concentrating research investment in the United Kingdom—the proportion of total public funding to the top 10th of researchers in the United Kingdom increased from 47% in 1980-1 to 57% in 1997-8, compared with a decline in the United States from 47% to 43%.
21385804:7	In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, 75% of the total score in any given subject area was derived from the assessment of publication outputs.
21385804:8	Lesser weighting was given to the research environment and evidence of “esteem.”
21385804:9	Units of assessment were aligned to major research themes, such as cardiovascular disease, but also recognised the methodological diversity of the more applied clinical research areas of clinical epidemiology, health services research, and primary care.
21385804:10	The 2008 scoring system placed more emphasis on research of “international quality,” evolving from the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise 0-5 star rating to an overall quality profile assessment of below national standard (“unclassified”), nationally recognised research (one star), internationally recognised research (two stars), internationally excellent research (three stars), and world leading research (four stars).
21385804:11	The Research Assessment Exercise therefore provided a qualitative assessment (and comparison by institution), ranked by international importance, of research within the United Kingdom.
21385804:12	The reliability of these international ratings of research importance is, however, unclear.
21385804:13	Assessors categorised international research in the absence of any published criteria on what defines “recognised” compared with “world beating” status.
21385804:14	In terms of crude comparisons, overall UK research tops the world league for papers per dollar expended and citations per dollar expended and is ranked fourth for papers per researcher.
21385804:15	Furthermore, the United Kingdom delivers 9% of the world’s research effort for 4.5% of the world’s research expenditure (and in a high cost economy).
21385804:16	But how does a relatively young academic discipline such as primary care compare on quality internationally?
21385804:17	Subpanels encompassing more applied clinical research, including primary care, have historically been rated below laboratory and hospital based research in Research Assessment Exercises.
21385804:18	Furthermore, commentators have questioned the viability of primary care research.
21385804:19	Despite limitations, the United Kingdom may transfer future state support for academic research from the substantially peer led Research Assessment Exercise review (high intensity, high cost) to assessments in the Research Excellence Framework, potentially informed by bibliometric indicators and expert review.
21385804:20	Subpanels for the Research Excellence Framework may use data on citations to inform their assessments.
21385804:21	To internationally benchmark UK research on primary care, we carried out volume and quality analyses of publications by primary care researchers from six countries with well established primary care research before the publication of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise.
21385804:22	Methods 
We undertook the project in two stages.
21385804:23	Firstly, we assessed the volume of research on primary care by country adjusted for national differences, where we defined a primary care researcher as a researcher based wholly or in part in a university investigating primary care issues, or a primary care professional (such as a general practitioner or family doctor) engaged in research.
21385804:24	Secondly, we assessed the publication profile of the researchers with the highest volume of output in each country, where we defined the highest volume as researchers from primary care with the highest number of publications reporting research findings published between 2001 and 2007 (inclusive) and identified by literature searches of Medline and Embase.
21385804:25	Results 
Discussion 
On the basis of this comparison between six countries, UK researchers from primary care with a high volume of publications are internationally competitive.
21385804:26	In every comparison the United Kingdom was in the top two countries for output volume and measures of performance, such as numbers of publications per 10 000 researchers or per billion gross expenditure on research and development.
21385804:27	When we standardised the output measures to allow national comparisons of productivity of the authors, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were top among the six countries.
21385804:28	The sample also showed that the United Kingdom’s research output from primary care was increasing, although at a slower rate than that of the Netherlands and the United States.
21385804:29	The average quality of high volume UK researchers from primary care was also higher than comparators.
21385804:30	UK researchers were in the top 10 for all performance measures, and their main competitors were American and Dutch researchers.
21385804:31	Furthermore, the UK researchers tended to score better for citations and mean number of citations.
21385804:32	The United Kingdom also had six researchers in the top 10 for achieving high proportions of publications with 20 or more citations.
21385804:33	These data show that UK primary care research competes successfully with selected high spending research economies and, based on an initial volume screen, can be equated with “world leading” status.
21385804:34	The literature on the research output of different specialties within countries is large.
21385804:35	However, international comparisons are rare.
21385804:36	One of the few papers reporting research volume focuses on respiratory disease but does not address quality.
21385804:37	Where comparisons were available they tended to measure different things and to have different objectives, such as how to measure better the productivity between institutions of differing sizes.

19325166:0	Introduction 
Carotenoids form an important family of isoprenoid pigments synthesized by plants and certain algae, bacteria, and fungi.
19325166:1	In photosynthetic organisms carotenoids play essential functions as components of the light-harvesting system, and protecting plant cells against an oxidation-derived excess of light energy.
19325166:2	Moreover, cis -epoxycarotenoids are the precursors of the plant hormone abscisic acid which plays a crucial role in several physiological processes ( ; ).
19325166:3	Carotenoids with a β-ring end group are the precursors of vitamin A and therefore are fundamental for animal nutrition, including humans, which cannot synthesize this vitamin.
19325166:4	The beneficial effects of carotenoids are also derived from their potent antioxidant activity.
19325166:5	All these properties have provided evidence linking carotenoid intake in the human diet with protection against certain cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and other degenerative processes ( ; ; ).
19325166:6	Carotenoids also provide the yellow, orange or red coloration characteristic of many flowers and fruits, to attract animals for pollination or for the dispersal of seeds.
19325166:7	Citrus fruits display a wide range of colorations due to the accumulation of specific carotenoids that substantially change in the peel and pulp of the different species and varieties ( ; ; ; ).
19325166:8	Recently, genes encoding for enzymes of the main steps of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway have been identified and their expression studied in fruit tissues of different citrus species during natural ( ; ; ; ; ; ; ) or ethylene-induced (Rodrigo and Zacarias, 2007) fruit ripening.
19325166:9	shows a schematic representation of the main steps of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway.
19325166:10	The peel of immature citrus fruit shows a carotenoid profile characteristic of chloroplast-containing tissue, with lutein (β,ε-xanthophyll) being the main carotenoid.
19325166:11	At the onset of fruit maturation, the content of lutein declined in parallel with the accumulation of specific β,β-xanthophylls, as 9- Z -violaxanthin, which is the major carotenoid in the peel and pulp of orange-coloured mature fruit, such as oranges and mandarins.
19325166:12	The massive increase in total carotenoids and β,β-xanthophylls occurring in the peel of orange and mandarin fruits during the transition from chloroplast to chromoplast is concomitant with the induction of phytoene synthase ( PSY ), phytoene desaturase ( PDS ), ζ-carotene desaturase ( ZDS ), and β-carotene hydroxylase ( β-CHX ) gene expression ( ; ; ).
19325166:13	Cyclization of lycopene is a key branching point in the carotenogenesis of Citrus fruits, since the shift from the β,ε-branch to the β,β-branch of the pathway determinates the change in carotenoid accumulation and composition during fruit colouration.
19325166:14	Two genes encoding lycopene cyclases ( LCY ) have been identified in citrus: ϵ-LCY and β-LCY and the ability of both enzymes to cycle lycopene has been confirmed.
19325166:15	β-LCY forms two β-rings at both extremes of the lineal molecule of lycopene, yielding β-carotene, while ε-LCY introduces a single ε-ring generating δ-carotene.
19325166:16	The expression of ϵ-LCY is down-regulated during the transition from chloroplast to chromoplast, while that of β-LCY is constitutive or slightly increases ( ; ; ; ).
19325166:17	Accumulation of both LCY transcripts has been also detected in leaves.
19325166:18	In other carotenogenic fruits, the regulation of LCY genes has been shown to be critical for the specific accumulation of lycopene.
19325166:19	In tomato, a model fruit for the study of carotenogenesis, down-regulation of ϵ-LCY and β-LCY is the mechanism responsible for the massive accumulation of lycopene during fruit ripening ( ; ).
19325166:20	Moreover, the existence of a chromoplast-specific lycopene β-cyclase ( CYC-B gene) which shows a transient expression at the breaker stage, explains the de novo synthesis of β-carotene during tomato fruit development.
19325166:21	Analysis of Delta Beta and old-gold tomato mutants has also highlighted the major role of lycopene cyclases in the tomato carotenoid complement.
19325166:22	In the Delta mutant, up-regulation of ϵ-LCY during tomato fruit ripening correlates with the accumulation of δ-carotene.
19325166:23	The pale orange coloration of Beta mutant fruits is due to an important increase in the transcription of the CYC-B gene which leads to a higher accumulation of β-carotene than in wild-type fruit.
19325166:24	By contrast, the old-gold mutant carries a null allele of CYC-B resulting in an elevated concentration of lycopene and a reduction of β-carotene.
19325166:25	In pepper, the function of cyclases has been also examined.
19325166:26	The expression of the β-LCY gene is low and constitutive during fruit maturation; however, the capsanthin-capsorubin synthase ( CCS ) gene, which encodes a protein which also has lycopene β-cyclase activity, is highly induced during fruit coloration.
19325166:27	Thus, the simultaneous action of both β-LCY and CCS activities has been postulated to be responsible for the massive and specific channelling of carotenes into the β,β-branch during the ripening of red pepper.
19325166:28	Recently, a β-LCY gene from watermelon has been isolated and it has been proposed to be a determinant of the canary yellow and red flesh coloration.
19325166:29	Transcriptional profiling of the β-LCY gene was similar in the flesh of yellow and red watermelon, but polymorphisms were detected in the coding region of the specific sequences co-segregating with each colour phenotype.
19325166:30	Therefore, it appears that a critical mutation in the red watermelon β-LCY allele might reduce β-cyclase activity, resulting in the accumulation of lycopene.
19325166:31	The presence of lycopene in Citrus fruits is an uncommon feature.
19325166:32	Most of the lycopene-accumulating mutants have been identified in grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi ) and pummelo ( Citrus grandis ), and only three in orange ( Citrus sinensis ): Shara, Cara Cara, and Hong Anliu ( ; ; ).
19325166:33	Due to the high antioxidant activity and health-promoting effects of lycopene, and to the attractive colouration provided by this lineal carotene to citrus fruits, extensive investigations into the mechanisms involved in the accumulation of lycopene in orange mutants have recently been addressed.
19325166:34	Biochemical data suggest that different regulatory mechanisms operate between lycopene-accumulating mutants of orange and red grapefruit ( ; ; ; ).
19325166:35	The pulp of Cara Cara contains higher levels of linear carotenes, including lycopene, without affecting the normal complement of β,β-xanthophylls.
19325166:36	By contrast, in red grapefruit, accumulation of lycopene is accompanied by an increase in β-carotene and a considerable reduction of β,β-xanthophylls.
19325166:37	Expression analysis of isoprenoid and carotenoid biosynthetic genes in fruits of the Cara Cara mutant suggest a higher induction of the expression of MEP-isoprenoid genes as the possible origin of its abnormal carotenoid profile.
19325166:38	In the orange mutant Hong Anliu, an increased expression of early carotenoid biosynthetic genes could account for the accumulation of lycopene and other upstream carotenoids.
19325166:39	To date, the molecular basis of lycopene accumulation in red grapefruit has not been analysed, even though alterations in β-LCY and/or β-CHX have been postulated as the possible mechanisms responsible for its particular carotenoid profile ( ; ).
19325166:40	The objective of this investigation was to isolate and characterize new β-LCY from citrus fruits that may explain the massive accumulation of β,β-xanthophylls occurring during the ripening of orange fruits.
19325166:41	In the present work, a novel chromoplast-specific lycopene β-cyclase gene, so-called β-LCY2 which is highly induced in the peel and pulp of Navel orange fruit during ripening, is reported.
19325166:42	Functional analysis by a colour complementation assay in E. coli demonstrated that β-LCY2 encoded a bona fide β-cyclase.
19325166:43	It was then hypothesized that this new β-LCY2 gene might be involved in the molecular mechanism underlying lycopene accumulation in the red grapefruit.
19325166:44	To elucidate this, the expression of the chromoplast-specific β - LCY2 gene, as well as the expression of another seven carotenoid biosynthetic genes, were analysed in the peel and pulp of Star Ruby red grapefruit, which is one of the red grapefruit with higher lycopene content, and compared with the corresponding tissues of ordinary Navel orange.
19325166:45	The study is supplemented with functional assays of the β -LCY2 alleles isolated from the red grapefruit Star Ruby.

Results 
Discussion 
Cyclization of lycopene by lycopene cyclases (ε- and β-LCY) to produce α- and β-carotene is a key regulatory branching point in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and alterations in their regulation or enzyme activity profoundly affect carotenoid composition (Hirchsberg, 2001; ; ; ; ).
19325166:47	During ripening of sweet orange fruit ( C. sinensis ) a substantial accumulation of specific β,β-xanthophylls occurs in both flavedo and pulp ( ; ; ).
19325166:48	This process implies an important stimulation of the β,β-cyclization of lycopene.
19325166:49	However, the previously characterized β-LCY from C. sinensis ( Csβ-LCY1 ), showed a low and relatively constant expression during fruit ripening ( ; ; ).
19325166:50	In this work, the isolation and functional characterization of a gene encoding a β-LCY, namely Csβ-LCY2, from orange fruit is reported.
19325166:51	Taken together, results indicate that, firstly, this gene plays a major function in the carotenogenesis of citrus fruit and in the massive and specific channelling of carotenes into the β,β-branch during ripening of orange fruit and, secondly, alterations in the expression of this gene and in the function of the corresponding protein are likely to be involved in the accumulation of lycopene characteristic of red grapefruit.
19325166:52	The expression of β-LCY2 was restricted to chromoplastic tissues and the up-regulation of Csβ-LCY2 gene parallels the massive accumulation of β,β-xanthophylls accompanying orange fruit maturation ( ; ; ; ).
19325166:53	Moreover, treatment of mature-green fruits with exogenous ethylene which promotes accumulation of β,β-xanthophylls (Rodrigo and Zacarias, 2007), also induced the accumulation of Csβ-LCY2 transcript.
19325166:54	In contrast to these patterns of expression, the transcript of the canonical β-LCY gene, renamed as Csβ-LCY1 was detected at a similar level throughout the whole maturation/ripening period in orange fruits and also in vegetative tissues ( ; ; ).
19325166:55	The chromoplastic expression of Csβ-LCY2 is also reinforced by the in silico expression analysis through 182 cDNA libraries generated from diverse citrus tissues, developmental stages and species.
19325166:56	All the ESTs corresponding to Csβ-LCY2 were identified in libraries from fruit or flower tissues and only one EST was identified in a library from green senescent ovaries (see at JXB online).
19325166:57	This last finding could be explained by the high rate of ethylene production generating senescent citrus fruits ( ; ) since, as happens with most carotenogenic genes (Rodrigo and Zacarias, 2007), ethylene stimulates the expression of Csβ-LCY2.
19325166:58	These results strongly suggest that Csβ-LCY2 plays a key role in the carotenogenesis of citrus fruits, by redirecting the flux of carotenes into the β,β-branch to lead to the accumulation of xanthophylls characteristic of orange fruit ripening.
19325166:59	The presence of two β-LCY s genes, one with a chromoplast-specific expression during fruit maturation, has previously been reported in other carotenogenic fruits.
19325166:60	The CYC-B gene from tomato is transiently expressed in fruit and also detected in flower petals whereas it is undetectable in roots, leaves, and stem.
19325166:61	The overexpression of this gene in tomato promotes the formation of β-carotene in the fruit while in antisense plants or defective mutants results in higher levels of lycopene in chromoplastic tissues without affecting carotenoid composition in vegetative tissues.
19325166:62	In pepper, besides β-LCY, the capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS), which also has β-cyclase activity, participates and has a key role in the cyclization of lycopene during fruit coloration.
19325166:63	Moreover, it has also been suggested that the orthologous CYC-B gene from watermelon might be an essential colour determinant.
19325166:64	Therefore, the involvement of a second chromoplastic-specific β-LCY in the regulation of carotenoid composition appears to be a frequent mechanism in carotenogenic fruits.
19325166:65	Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of the citrus β-LCY2 showed that it is more closely related to chromoplastic cyclases ( CYC-B and CCS ) than to the previously isolated β-LCY1 from citrus.
19325166:66	Evolutionarily, a common origin by duplication of an ancestral β-LCY has been proposed for chromoplast-specific β-cyclases ( ; ) in agreement with the intronless structure of the genomic sequences of lycopene β-cyclases from tomato, pepper and citrus ( ; ).
19325166:67	Despite the moderate similarity between Csβ-LCY2 and Csβ-LCY1 (53% identical), several structural and functional domains previously defined in other plant β-LCYs were found in the β-LCY2 sequence ( ; ; ).
19325166:68	For example, domains proposed as essential for lycopene cyclase activity were highly conserved.
19325166:69	In agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated the peripheral association of the β-LCY1 from C. sinensis to the surface of chloroplasts, Csβ-LCY2 also contains a predicted transit peptide for plastid import suggesting a similar location.
19325166:70	Interestingly, two different alleles of β-LCY2 : β-LCY2a and β-LCY2b were identified in the three Citrus species analysed, C. sinensis C. paradisi and C. clementina ( ; see at JXB online).
19325166:71	This finding was not surprising, as the existence of more than one allele for other carotenogenic genes in Citrus such as PSY PDS β-LCY and ϵ-LCY has been reported.
19325166:72	The presence of diverse alleles of CYC-B the orthologous β-LCY2 gene of tomato, has also been described.
19325166:73	The activity of both citrus β-LCY2 alleles was assayed using a lycopene-accumulating strain of E. coli and although β-LCY2a and β-LCY2b encode 96% identical proteins, β-LCY2a catalyses the β-cyclization of lycopene while β-LCY2b is mostly devoid of this activity.
19325166:74	The high degree of similarity in the characteristic motifs over plant β- and ε-LCYs, and in other related enzymes such as CCS, suggests that slight alterations in the sequence of the β-LCY2b allele could strongly affect its activity.
19325166:75	A good example for that has been reported in lettuce, in which a change in one single amino acid in ε-LCY determines the ability of introducing one or two ε-rings in the molecule of lycopene, or even to abolish the cyclase activity.
19325166:76	In the present investigation, 16 amino acid changes were detected between β-LCY2a and β-LCY2b sequences that presumably could alter the β-cyclase activity.
19325166:77	Among these amino acid substitutions, three of them are located in evolutionarily conserved domains.
19325166:78	Changes in the amino acids 67 and 72 involve a change in the polarity of the amino acid (Val to Glu and Asp to Val, respectively) in a motif conserved in all plant β-LCY which is located in the predicted transit peptide.
19325166:79	The replacement of Gly by Ser at the position 359 in β-LCY2b might result in a more dramatic alteration of β-cyclase activity since Gly is conserved in all β-LCY so far characterized, including those from photosynthetic algae and bacteria.
19325166:80	These amino acid alterations are likely to be involved in the loss of activity found for the protein coded by the β-LCY2b Citrus allele.
19325166:81	However, the impact of the different amino acid substitutions on lycopene β-cyclase activity requires further characterization.
19325166:82	Lycopene accumulation is an atypical feature in most citrus fruits, since it has only been reported in few species.
19325166:83	However, it is an intermediary metabolite in the biosynthesis of β,β-xanthophylls, the most abundant carotenoids in ripe orange and mandarin fruit ( ; ; ; ; ; ).
19325166:84	Recently, two orange mutants, Hong Anliu and Cara Cara, which accumulate lycopene in the pulp, have been characterized and an up-regulation of early carotenogenic genes and those from the MEP pathway, respectively, have been proposed to be responsible for their particular carotenoid composition ( ; ).
19325166:85	In both orange mutants, accumulation of lycopene occurs without affecting the normal content and composition of xanthophylls with respect to the parental fruit.
19325166:86	Based on the carotenoid profile, it has been proposed that the mechanism responsible for lycopene accumulation in grapefruits is different from that in red orange mutants.
19325166:87	Despite the commercial relevance and the extensive consumption of red grapefruit, the molecular basis of lycopene accumulation has not yet been investigated.
19325166:88	In order to elucidate this process, the expression profiles of eight genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, including the chromoplast-specific β-LCY2 were analysed in the flavedo and pulp of Star Ruby red grapefruit and Navel orange during ripening.
19325166:89	In the pulp of mature Star Ruby, the massive accumulation of lycopene is accompanied by an increase in linear carotenes and β-carotene, and almost a completely absence of xanthophylls.
19325166:90	A simple hypothesis to explain this phenotype considers a blockage of the carotenoid pathway at the level of β-LCY and β-CHX ( ; ).
19325166:91	Interestingly, in Star Ruby a substantial reduction in the expression of β-LCY2 and β-CHX but not in β-LCY1 was observed, and was more considerable in the pulp than in flavedo.
19325166:92	In addition, it was also observed that the non-functional β-LCY2b allele was preferentially expressed in Star Ruby grapefruit, which would decrease the effective lycopene β-cyclase capability of this genotype.
19325166:93	Together, these alterations may provide the molecular basis to explain the accumulation of lycopene in red grapefruits; a reduced expression of the β-LCY2 and β-CHX genes, and the preferential transcription of the non-functional β-LCY2b allele.
19325166:94	It is interesting to note that the pulp of Star Ruby also accumulates β-carotene.
19325166:95	This effect may be explained by the reduced expression of β-CHX and the β-cyclization of lycopene provided by β-LCY1, whose expression and functionality in Star Ruby fruit tissues are similar to those of Navel oranges.
19325166:96	Also, these results indicate that β-LCY1 is not able to compensate for the reduced β-LCY2 activity, thus suggesting that β-LCY1 is not efficiently contributing to redirect the flux towards the β,β-branch in chromoplastic tissues.
19325166:97	Star Ruby is one of the more intense red-coloured grapefruit, especially in the pulp, and was therefore selected for this study.
19325166:98	There are, however, wide collections of red-pigmented grapefruit cultivars exhibiting colour singularities ranging from pale pink to deep red.
19325166:99	Early investigations reported that these colour variations are due to different accumulations of lycopene and β-carotene ( ; ; ; ; ).
19325166:100	In other plant species, is has been reported that polymorphism in a LCY gene may explain the natural variation in colour in different tissues.
19325166:101	Hence, polymorphisms in ϵ-LCY are related to β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin content in kernels in different maize cultivars and polymorphisms in β-LCY co-segregated with flesh colour in watermelon cultivars.
19325166:102	Since the β-LCY2 gene appears to be a critical regulatory step in the biosynthesis of carotenoids in Citrus fruits, it is temping to speculate that the genetic colour variability found in red-pigmented grapefruits might be due either to differences in β-LCY2 transcript accumulation or/and to relative expression between β-LCY2a/LCY2b alleles.
19325166:103	Even though further work is needed, these results suggest that additional regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid accumulation, based on the presence of two functionally different alleles with different transcript accumulation, are important in determining carotenoid composition in Citrus fruits, as it has been postulated previously.
19325166:104	It has been suggested that the β-cyclization of lycopene is the step involved in the differentiation of red grapefruits and pummelos.
19325166:105	β - LCY1 is a single-copy gene and grapefruit is the only specie containing the two pummelo alleles of this gene, but orange-coloured Citrus species carry one allele from pummelo and one from mandarin.
19325166:106	In conclusion, in this work the isolation and functional characterization of a novel chromoplast-specific Csβ-LCY2 from Citrus highly induced in the flavedo and pulp of Navel oranges during fruit maturation is reported.
19325166:107	Csβ-LCY2 appears to play a key role in the regulation of carotenoids biosynthesis, redirecting the flux of carotenes into the β,β-branch of the pathway to lead to the accumulation of xanthophylls.
19325166:108	Two alleles of the gene have been isolated, one with a higher conversion of lycopene to β-carotene in E. coli and the other almost devoid of activity.
19325166:109	In the red grapefruit Star Ruby, accumulation of lycopene during maturation was associated with a substantial reduction in the expression of β-LCY2 and β-CHX genes with respect to Navel oranges.
19325166:110	Moreover, Star Ruby grapefruit predominantly expressed the non-functional β-LCY2 allele during fruit ripening whereas fruit tissues of Navel oranges preferably expressed the functional allele.
19325166:111	It is suggested that the presence of diverse alleles of the β-LCY2 gene, encoding enzymes with altered activity, with different transcript accumulation may be an additional regulatory mechanism of carotenoid synthesis involved in the accumulation of lycopene in red grapefruits.

20062611:0	Introduction 
Differential diagnosis of a cerebral lesion can prove to be a very challenging task for the treating physician.
20062611:1	Many non-neoplastic neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis, stroke, pyogenic abscess, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, cysticercosis, fungal infections, syphilis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, radiation necrosis, venous thrombosis can mimic brain neoplasms on neuroimaging . Some of these diseases have a benign character and can be managed without exposing patients to the unnecessary risks of a surgical procedure . On the other hand, certain brain tumors can appear de novo, in the absence of prior existing lesions, mimicking other diseases . Therefore, an accurate and timely diagnosis is essential in such cases and special techniques are required for proper differential diagnosis.
20062611:2	We present the case of a patient, without a previous history of multiple sclerosis, presenting with a large brain lesion mimicking a brain tumor.
20062611:3	We discuss the diagnostic process and techniques in the management of tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis.
20062611:4	Case presentation 
A previously healthy 23-year-old Caucasian male was referred to our Emergency Department.
20062611:5	Upon admission, he reported a 3-weeks old history of blurred vision and instability, lasting for 5 days.
20062611:6	On physical examination, patient's vital signs, ECG and general medical condition were normal.
20062611:7	He was fully alert and oriented.
20062611:8	Neurological examination revealed a left homonymous hemianopsia.
20062611:9	Tendon reflexes were equally elicited on both sides for upper and lower limbs and a Babinski sign was detected on the left side.
20062611:10	There was not any bowel or bladder dysfunction.
20062611:11	No other motor or sensory deficit was found in the Neurological examination.
20062611:12	Brain MRI presented a large lesion at the right parietal lobe extending till the temporal lobe with consequent edema, compressing the posterior aspect of the right ventricle.
20062611:13	Few small periventricalar lesions were found in both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the cerebellum.
20062611:14	No lesion showed gadolinium enhancement (Figure ).
20062611:15	Staging with thoracic and abdominal CT scans had not revealed any other lesions.
20062611:16	Cervical MRI did not detect any spinal cord lesions.
20062611:17	Therefore, intracranial lesions such as tumors (CNS Lymphoma), abscess, sarcoidosis and demyelinating disease should lead the differential diagnosis.
20062611:18	Patient's routine blood tests were within normal range.
20062611:19	Mantoux was negative.
20062611:20	Serum Sace was normal.
20062611:21	Electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis were mot indicative of any pathology.
20062611:22	CSF examination showed pleiocytosis (92 cells), mostly lymphocytes and few mononuclear cells while IgG Index was increased and oligoclonal bands were positive.
20062611:23	Serum viral examination for HIV, HBV, HCV, HSV1, HSV2 and CMV was negative, while VZV IgG were detected at remarkably high titers (VZV IgG: 784.84 (positive: normal values < 60) 
Visual and auditory evoqued potentials did not show any delayed responses.
20062611:24	Visual fields examination showed left homonymous hemianopsia (Figure ).
20062611:25	After thorough examination of all clinical radiological and laboratory findings, (negative staging, increased signal intensity in T2W and Flair sequences, CSF examination), our differential diagnosis was mainly limited to a primary brain tumor, or to tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis.
20062611:26	Accordingly, we proceeded to a Spectroscopic MRI . The extensive lesion of the right hemisphere showed a decrease in the concentration of N-acetylaspartate and creatine, while a 50% increase in the concentration of choline was detected.
20062611:27	No differences were found in the concentration of myoinositol between the two hemispheres.
20062611:28	Several small lesions were found in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, indicative of a demyelinating disease (Figure Figure Figure ).
20062611:29	The patient received cortisol i.v., 1 gr Solumedrole i.v. for 5 days, substituted by per os administered cortisol.
20062611:30	His neurological status gradually improved.
20062611:31	During a five year follow up, he had no relapses and brain MRI showed a considerable decrease of the size of the tumor like demyelinating lesion.
20062611:32	Discussion 
Homonymous hemianopsia (HH) is the commonest form of acquired homonymous visual field defect.
20062611:33	The most common causes of HH are stroke, head injury and intracranial tumors . HH has been related to neurosarcoidosis . Symptomatic homonymous visual field defects are relatively rare in MS, encountered in 1% of patients.
20062611:34	On the other hand, single, rare, tumor-like MS lesions may present with uncommon symptoms, including HH [ - ].
20062611:35	In our case, the patient presented with left homonymous hemianopsia due to a demyelinating lesion of the right hemisphere mimicking brain tumour.
20062611:36	Although he had no history of multiple sclerosis and hemianopsia is a relatively unusual first manifestation of this disease, oligoclinal bands were positive and IgG index was increased.
20062611:37	Visual fields were normal four months after the episode.
20062611:38	During a five year follow up after the episode, the patient remained free of any neurological symptoms (Figure ).
20062611:39	Diagnostically, MRI imaging of tumor like demyelinating lesions (TLDL) resemble brain tumors, and diagnosis is quite difficult . The use of additional techniques may assist to distinguish the nature of these lesions.
20062611:40	Perfusion-Weighted MRI (PWI), proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) as well as Thallium-201 Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and 18-FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET), may be applied for an accurate differential diagnosis of a brain tumor . In our case, MRS gave a detailed description of the lesion and assisted the final diagnosis.
20062611:41	A common finding of the acute MS lesion is the reduced NAA levels due to axonal damage and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction which is proposed to be reversible over time.
20062611:42	Furthermore, elevation of choline is consistently found in acute MS lesions probably due to reactive astrogliosis and demyelination . 
Conclusion 
Treating physicians should always bear in mind of tumefactive MS when encountering a cerebral lesion, since despite the demanding differential diagnosis by means of special techniques, this disease has a benign character and can be managed without exposing patients to the unnecessary risks of a surgical procedure.

21106111:0	Background 
Ampullary carcinomas (ACs), although uncommon, have a better prognosis than other periampullary tumors such as pancreatic and bile duct carcinomas.
21106111:1	The ampulla of Vater consists of 4 minor anatomic regions: the ampulloduodenum (Ad), the ampullopancreatobiliary common duct (Ac), the ampullopancreatic duct (Ap), and the ampullobiliary duct (Ab).
21106111:2	The ampulla is formed by the union of 2 distinct types of mucosa.
21106111:3	The Ad is covered by intestinal mucosa, while the other parts of the ampulla of Vater (the Ap, Ab, and Ac) are lined with pancreatobiliary-type ductal mucosa.
21106111:4	Therefore, ACs may arise from the intestinal-type mucosa as well as from the pancreatobiliary-type mucosa; this may explain the broad histomorphologic spectrum of these tumors.
21106111:5	Tumor progression and prognosis are affected by the primary AC tumor sites [ , ].
21106111:6	Kimura et al. classified ACs into 2 histological subtypes: intestinal and pancreatobiliary.
21106111:7	Albores-Saavedra et al. further defined the characteristics of these 2 types and also described unusual types such as signet-ring cell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma.
21106111:8	While histopathological typing is a useful method for classifying ACs, some cases cannot be easily classified by using histomorphology.
21106111:9	Determination of the cytokeratin (CK) and apomucin (MUC) immunophenotypes of an AC can facilitate identification of the primary tumor site[ , - ].
21106111:10	Most pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas express CK7 and low levels of CK20[ , ].
21106111:11	Among ACs, the pancreatobiliary type expresses CK7 but does not express CK20, while the intestinal type expresses CK20 but does not express CK7.
21106111:12	The pancreatobiliary type of ACs usually express MUC1 but do not express MUC2[ , ].
21106111:13	Most intestinal-type ACs express MUC2[ , ].
21106111:14	In the present study, we analyzed the spectrum of CK and MUC expression in 43 patients with ACs.
21106111:15	We then evaluated the immunohistochemical subtypes of ACs by analyzing the expressions of CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 in these tumors.
21106111:16	Further, we assessed the correlations between the histomorphological findings and the defined immunohistochemical subtypes and evaluated the clinical significance of these immunohistochemical AC subtypes; the classification of ACs on the basis of their immunohistochemical characteristics may be useful to predict the clinical outcome.
21106111:17	Materials and methods 
Clinical data were obtained retrospectively from ACs that were surgically resected from 43 patients (22 men and 21 women) with an average age of 66.4 years (range, 44-82 years).
21106111:18	All resected specimens had been obtained between 1983 and 2007 and were maintained at the Department of Digestive and General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University.
21106111:19	All but 5 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy.
21106111:20	The other 5 underwent pancreas-sparing duodenectomy.
21106111:21	All tumors included in this study histologically showed surgically negative margins.
21106111:22	The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee.
21106111:23	Informed consent was obtained from all patients for the subsequent use of resected tissues.
21106111:24	Histopathological examinations were performed according to the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Biliary Surgery.
21106111:25	The Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) Staging System put forth by the International Union Against Cancer was used for tumor classification.
21106111:26	All tumors were classified histologically according to the criteria published by Albores-Saavedra et al. Intestinal-type carcinomas are composed of well-formed tubular to elongated glands, complex cribriform areas, and solid nests indistinguishable from those found in colorectal adenocarcinoma, whereas pancreatobiliary-type carcinomas mostly consist of simple or branching glands and small solid nests of cells surrounded by a strikingly desmoplastic stroma (Figure ).
21106111:27	Mixed-pattern tumors were classified into the intestinal- or pancreatobiliary-type groups on the basis of their predominant component.
21106111:28	Carcinomas of the unusual types included undifferentiated, mucinous, signet-ring cell, and solid carcinomas.
21106111:29	Results 
Discussion 
Albores-Saavedra et al. defined 3 types of ACs--the intestinal type, the pancreatobiliary type, and the unusual type.
21106111:30	In the present study on ACs, we histologically classified these tumors into these 3 types, and 37% were of the intestinal type, 42% were of the pancreatobiliary type, and 21% were of the unusual type.
21106111:31	According to the histological criteria, Zhou et al. reported the rates of the histological intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and unusual types to be 27%, 44%, and 29%, respectively.
21106111:32	According to their histological criteria, the unusual type included mucinous, signet-ring cell, solid, or undifferentiated carcinomas.
21106111:33	However, Kimura et al. simply classified ACs into 2 types, intestinal and pancreatobiliary.
21106111:34	Because these systems of histological classification use different sets of criteria, we tried to create a simple AC classification system based on immunohistochemical staining of CKs and MUCs.
21106111:35	Goldstein et al. reported positive CK7 expression in 100% and positive CK20 expression in 43% of ACs, but it was difficult to distinguish between pancreatic carcinomas and ACs by the coordinate staining patterns of CK7 and CK20.
21106111:36	Very few reports have examined the expression patterns of CK and MUC in the AC subtypes[ , ].
21106111:37	In a previous study, the CK7+/CK20-/MUC2- pattern in the histological intestinal-type carcinoma and the CK7-/CK20+/MUC2+ pattern in the histological pancreatobiliary-type carcinoma indicated that these different types of ACs had developed from 2 different types of mucosa in the ampulla of Vater.
21106111:38	Chu et al. reported positive expression of CK7, CK20, and MUC2 in the histological intestinal-type and positive expression of CK7 and MUC1 in the histological pancreatobiliary-type and that ACs of pancreatobiliary origin showed immunophenotypes similar to that of pancreatic ductal carcinoma.
21106111:39	Zhou et al. were the first to show agreement between the histological classification and the immunohistochemical characterization based on cytokeratins.
21106111:40	However, their immunohistochemical classification did not correlate with tumor progression and prognosis.
21106111:41	Although most other studies have described immunohistochemical classification systems based on the expression of either MUC or CK, we analyzed the expression of both in ACs.
21106111:42	In the present study, significant differences were noted in the expression levels of the histological intestinal type and the histological pancreatobiliary type, with the sensitivity being 100% for CK20 and 94% for MUC1 expression, respectively.
21106111:43	These results indicate that the CK20+/MUC1- pattern fully corresponds to the immunohistochemical I-type and that the CK20-/MUC1+ pattern fully corresponds to the immunohistochemical PB-type.
21106111:44	With regard to immunohistochemical classification systems, Zhou et al classified ACs on the basis of the combined expression of CK7 and CK20, while Chu et al classified ACs on the basis of the combined expression of CDX2, CK17, MUC1, and MUC2.
21106111:45	Little is known, however, about the combined expression of CK20 and MUC1 in ACs.
21106111:46	The possibility of identifying the primary AC site is increased when the combined expression of CK and MUC, rather the expression of either one of them, is taken into account.
21106111:47	We found that the classification of the immunohistochemical subtypes based on the expression of both CK20 and MUC1 correlated well with histological typing (κ-coefficient = 0.5184).
21106111:48	Using this immunohistochemical classification system based on the coordinated expression of CK20 and MUC1, we were able to determined that 2 of 9 tumors classified as the histological unusual type expressed the pancreatobiliary pattern in immunohistochemical analysis, while 1 of these 9 tumors expressed the intestinal pattern.
21106111:49	Previous studies have shown that the prognosis of AC patients depends on the pT stage, nodal metastasis, and histological type[ , - ].
21106111:50	Similarly, our results indicated that the pT stage, nodal metastasis, and histological subtype correlated significantly with cumulative survival.
21106111:51	According to our histological classification method, a large number of intestinal type ACs were at stage pT1 (60%) and node-negative (81%).
21106111:52	These results indicate that progression of the intestinal-type tumor is slower and the risks of nodal metastasis lower than those in the case of the pancreatobiliary- and unusual-type tumors.
21106111:53	In our immunohistochemical classification, the pT stage correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical subtypes.
21106111:54	Although the number of immunohistochemical I-type tumors in the early pT stages was significantly greater than the number of immunohistochemical PB-type and O-type tumors in the same stages, there were no significant differences in the cumulative survival.
21106111:55	This result may be attributable to the lack of differences in the nodal metastasis risks associated with the immunohistochemical I-type and PB-type.
21106111:56	This may indicate that the risks of nodal metastasis are similar among the intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and other types.
21106111:57	Therefore, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection should be performed for adequate surgical resection in AC.
21106111:58	If function-preserving surgery has been selected for AC, the histological classification system is currently more useful than our immunohistochemical classification method.
21106111:59	Gürbüz et al. reported that MUC5AC- and MUC6-positive expression patterns were regarded as representing gastric differentiation and that negative expression of both indicated the intestinal type of AC.
21106111:60	Zhou et al. showed that gastric MUC5AC expression correlated well with PB-type carcinomas.
21106111:61	Interestingly, we found that the frequency of the coexpression of gastric MUC5AC and MUC6 in the immunohistochemical O-type was significantly higher than those in the immunohistochemical I-type or PB-type.
21106111:62	These results provide evidence that both the immunohistochemical I-type and immunohistochemical PB-type have low-grade expression of gastric mucins.
21106111:63	Expression of these gastric MUCs in the immunohistochemical O-type indicates that both gastric foveolar and pyloric gland metaplasia occur in the immunohistochemical O-type[ - ].
21106111:64	In addition, patients with tumors of the immunohistochemical O-type and MUC5AC and MUC6 coexpression had a significantly longer survival than those with tumors that did not show this coexpression.
21106111:65	Among the tumors of the immunohistochemical O-type, those negative for the coexpression were at a more advanced pT stage than those positive for the coexpression.
21106111:66	The prognosis of tumors of the immunohistochemical O-type that were positive or negative for the coexpression may depend on the tumor stage.
21106111:67	Thus, gastric differentiation of the immunohistochemical O-type is associated with good prognosis.
21106111:68	Interestingly, our observations of the histological unusual type were similar.
21106111:69	In summary, we studied the expression of CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 in ACs.
21106111:70	On the basis of the histological classification of ACs, we found that CK20 had a high sensitivity for the histological intestinal type and MUC1 had high sensitivity for the histological pancreatobiliary type carcinoma.
21106111:71	On the basis of the observed differences in the expression patterns of both CK and MUC, we defined immunohistochemical subtypes.
21106111:72	These immunohistochemical subtypes correlated well with the conventional histomorphological classification but did not correlate with prognosis.
21106111:73	However, the coexpression of gastric MUC5AC and MUC6 correlates with the prognosis of patients with the immunohistochemical O-type of AC.

17101697:0	Introduction 
Insoluble deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ), in the form of senile plaques, and of tau, as neurofibrillary tangles, have long been accepted as the primary histopathological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
17101697:1	Although initial research focused on the role of Aβ and tau individually, recent evidence, including data demonstrating that amyloid pathology can up-regulate tau pathology ( ; ), defines a signaling pathway that leads from Aβ through tau ( ; ; ).
17101697:2	Regrettably, the key steps within this pathway remain poorly understood.
17101697:3	A promising new focus of investigation has been the role that nonfibrillar forms of Aβ, and to a lesser extent tau, play in AD.
17101697:4	Soluble forms of Aβ are more potent than fibrillar forms at eliciting cellular responses, such as increased apoptosis and decreased synaptic plasticity.
17101697:5	In fact, studies of transgenic animal models and AD patients have shown that cognitive deficits and synaptic loss correlate with soluble Aβ, rather than senile plaques ( ; ), suggesting that AD is initiated well before extracellular Aβ deposits are evident.
17101697:6	Neuronal microtubules serve as highways for axonal transport and, by extension, are critically involved in supporting synaptic integrity and neuronal viability.
17101697:7	The loss of axonal microtubules is a hallmark of AD, and a longstanding question has been whether their loss or the accumulation of insoluble tau filaments and Aβ plaques causes neurodegeneration.
17101697:8	To shed light on this issue, we have used cultured neuronal and nonneuronal cells to model effects of various forms of Aβ on microtubules.
17101697:9	Remarkably, we found that brief exposure of cells to submicromolar levels of prefibrillar Aβ42 caused massive and rapid tau-dependent disassembly of microtubules.
17101697:10	Similar results were obtained for prefibrillar Aβ40, albeit at much higher concentrations, but microtubules in either tau-expressing or -deficient cells were relatively resistant to fibrillar Aβ.
17101697:11	Collectively, these results highlight the most dramatic, rapid, and sensitive link between Aβ and tau described to date, identify microtubules as primary, tau-dependent targets of Aβ, and suggest that nonfibrillar Aβ and tau underlie the detrimental neurodegeneration observed in AD before the accumulation of fibrillar forms in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
17101697:12	Results and discussion 
Coexpression of tau-CFP and YFP-tubulin in CV-1 African green monkey kidney cells, which do not express endogenous tau, allowed effects of various forms of Aβ on tau and tubulin distributions to be monitored in live cells by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy.
17101697:13	Aβ is known to transition gradually from monomers to oligomers, protofibrils, and finally to highly stable fibrils.
17101697:14	Because we did not observe any consistent differences in behavior between freshly solubilized Aβ42, which is predominantly monomeric, versus Aβ42 enriched in octamers and larger oligomers that are recognized by a specific antibody, we refer to these forms of Aβ42 collectively as “prefibrillar.”
17101697:15	It must be noted, however, that oligomers were readily detectable in freshly solubilized Aβ42 (Fig.
17101697:16	S1, available at ).
17101697:17	Within 30 min to 3 h after adding 0.1–3 μM prefibrillar Aβ42 to culture media, tau dissociated from microtubules, which completely disassembled soon thereafter ( and Video 1).
17101697:18	Prefibrillar Aβ40 was also capable of inducing tau-dependent microtubule disassembly in CV-1 cells, but at a minimum concentration of 3 μM (Video 2).
17101697:19	In contrast, microtubules remained intact for >3 h when CV-1 cells expressing YFP-tubulin, but not tau-CFP, were exposed to as much as 3 μM prefibrillar Aβ42 ( and Video 3).
17101697:20	Similarly, microtubule integrity was unaffected in cells expressing tau-CFP after >2 h of exposure to as much as 3 μM fibrillar Aβ42 ( and Video 4).
17101697:21	Microtubule stability before and after exposure of cells to prefibrillar Aβ42 was also assessed using a biochemical assay that partitions unassembled and polymerized tubulin into Triton X-100–soluble and –insoluble fractions, respectively.
17101697:22	Prefibrillar Aβ42 led to a dramatic redistribution of tubulin into the unassembled fraction within 2 h of treatment.
17101697:23	This result was reinforced by quantitation of micrographs depicting Aβ42-induced microtubule loss in cells that did or did not express tau-CFP.
17101697:24	We thus conclude that tau makes CV-1 cell microtubules hypersensitive to prefibrillar Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, but not to fibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:25	Microtubule disassembly was also observed in primary rat cortical neurons after exposure to prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:26	Discrimination between polymerized and disassembled tubulin was not evident from immunostaining of the treated neurons.
17101697:27	Nevertheless, the immunofluorescence images show that before prefibrillar Aβ42 addition, the cells displayed numerous neuritic projections.
17101697:28	After only 30 min of cellular exposure to 1 μM prefibrillar Aβ42, the neurites displayed swollen varicosities, and at later time points the cells appeared to lose the majority of their neuritic projections.
17101697:29	Similar cultures were examined by electron microscopy.
17101697:30	Neurites in control cells typically contained densely packed microtubules arranged in parallel.
17101697:31	In contrast, neurites in cells treated with prefibrillar Aβ42 contained fewer, less organized microtubules and conspicuous swellings that were filled with membrane-bound organelles and were virtually devoid of microtubules.
17101697:32	Similar findings have been reported for primary cortical neurons exposed to 5 μM oligomeric Aβ40 for 3–6 h ( ; ).
17101697:33	The biochemical assay for unassembled and polymerized tubulin was used to monitor the effects of prefibrillar and fibrillar Aβ42 on microtubule integrity in cultured hippocampal neurons.
17101697:34	About 90% of the tubulin was polymerized in cells that were not exposed to Aβ42, but only 45% of the tubulin was polymerized after 2 h of exposure to 1 μM prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:35	Some microtubule loss (65% polymerized) was observed after a comparable exposure to fibrillar Aβ42, but only at the much higher total peptide concentration of 3 μM.
17101697:36	Tau was found to be required for microtubule disassembly in primary hippocampal neurons induced by prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:37	Neurons were treated with siRNA to reduce tau expression to trace levels ( and Fig.
17101697:38	S2, available at ).
17101697:39	After 2 h of exposure to 2 μM prefibrillar Aβ42, the level of polymerized tubulin remained nearly unchanged in tau-deficient neurons (∼20% soluble tubulin), whereas the tau-expressing neurons again showed an increase in soluble tubulin (∼60% soluble tubulin).
17101697:40	It was not possible to determine how much tau was microtubule bound or soluble in these experiments, because the tau was quantitatively solubilized by the Triton X-100 under conditions in which the polymerized tubulin was resistant to extraction.
17101697:41	Thus, the results for tubulin demonstrate that the endogenous tau in neurons, like transfected tau in CV-1 cells, makes microtubules acutely sensitive to prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:42	Treatment of tau-expressing neurons with prefibrillar Aβ42 under conditions that induced microtubule disassembly did not cause increased AD-like tau phosphorylation at any of several sites.
17101697:43	This was found by immunoblotting using phosphorylation-sensitive monoclonal anti-tau antibodies: PHF-1, AT180, and tau-1.
17101697:44	Although many additional AD-like phosphorylation sites remain to be examined, these data suggest that conversion of tau to an AD-like phosphorylation state does not underlie the release of tau from microtubules and subsequent microtubule disassembly induced by prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:45	The specificity of tau for microtubule loss in cells treated with prefibrillar Aβ42 was shown by expressing GFP-tagged MAP2c in CV-1 cells.
17101697:46	MAP2c is a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein with a microtubule binding domain ∼70% identical to that of tau's.
17101697:47	3 h of exposure to prefibrillar Aβ42 did not cause any apparent loss of microtubule integrity in cells.
17101697:48	A region of tau responsible for conferring sensitivity to Aβ42 was mapped using a combination of tau/MAP2c chimeric proteins and a CFP-tagged tau fragment.
17101697:49	Only cells expressing “tau chimera,” a GFP-tagged protein comprising the microtubule binding domain of MAP2c flanked by the N-terminal arm and C-terminal tail of tau ( and Videos 5–7, available at ) responded to the addition of prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:50	Similar activity was observed when the tau projection domain-CFP, which did not localize on microtubules, was expressed in cells that subsequently were treated with prefibrillar Aβ42 ( and Video 8).
17101697:51	The qualitative results shown in and Videos 1 and 4–8 were confirmed by quantitation of fluorescence micrographs for microtubule-containing cells before and after 3 h of exposure to prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:52	The N-terminal half of tau therefore responds to prefibrillar Aβ42 and does not have to target to microtubules to exert its effects.
17101697:53	Furthermore, the closely related neuronal microtubule protein, MAP2c, cannot substitute for tau at promoting microtubule disassembly in cells exposed to prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:54	The nature of the functional connection between Aβ and tau has been one of the most enduring and intractable mysteries in AD research, and solving this mystery is bound to open potential new avenues of early detection and therapeutic intervention for AD.
17101697:55	The results presented here represent the swiftest and most deleterious tau-dependent effects of Aβ that have yet been described.
17101697:56	When considered together with recently published studies demonstrating localization of oligomeric Aβ in AD brain at sites distinct from classic amyloid plaques, a critical role for oligomeric Aβ in memory loss, and colocalization of Aβ with tau in tangle-bearing AD neurons in vivo, the present results suggest a mechanism by which Aβ and tau conspire coordinately to compromise neuronal function.
17101697:57	Diminished microtubule integrity could hinder essential microtubule functions, such as axonal transport, which is required to maintain synapses, and delivery of exocytotic membranes to the cell surface to repair plasma membrane holes known to be induced by oligomeric Aβ.
17101697:58	The biochemical steps that underlie tau-dependent microtubule poisoning by prefibrillar Aβ remain unknown, but direct binding of tau to Aβ has been reported and thus represents one possible step.
17101697:59	Nevertheless, we have been unable to demonstrate specific coimmunoprecipitation of tau and Aβ out of tau-expressing cells exposed to prefibrillar Aβ42.
17101697:60	That the combination of prefibrillar Aβ and nonfilamentous tau were able to elicit such a dramatic disruption of microtubules supports the hypothesis that fibrillar forms of tau and Aβ are at least somewhat neuro-protective, because they sequester more dangerous, nonfibrillar forms of Aβ and tau.
17101697:61	The fact that tau is required for Aβ-induced microtubule loss could explain, at least in part, why neurons, the principal tau-expressing cell type, are the cellular targets for destruction in AD.
17101697:62	Moreover, the model presented here does not preclude other toxic functions of prefibrillar or fibrillar Aβ or filamentous tau, such as tau-dependent degeneration of cultured neurons induced by fibrillar Aβ40 or toxicity related to intracellular tau filament accumulation.
17101697:63	Nevertheless, the rapid, tau-dependent destruction of microtubules that we observed to be induced by submicromolar concentrations of prefibrillar Aβ42 suggests that this process is one of the seminal events in AD pathogenesis at the cellular level.

18366759:0	Introduction 
The adverse effect of tumor hypoxia on the outcome of clinical radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy is well established.
18366759:1	Hypoxic conditions elicit cellular responses designed to improve cell survival through an adaptive process.
18366759:2	Regulation of gene expression through HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) but also via other transcription factors plays an important role in this process.
18366759:3	Moreover, these changes in gene expression enable tumors to take advantage of the physiological response mechanisms to hypoxia to improve their own survival as well as their metastatic properties . 
HIF-1 is composed of two subunits belonging to the bHLH-PAS family: ARNT which is constitutively expressed in the nucleus and HIF-1α which is regulated by hypoxia.
18366759:4	In normoxia, HIF-1α is hydroxylated on two prolines by oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases and on one asparagine by an oxygen-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylase, FIH-1.
18366759:5	The two hydroxylated prolines are recognized by the protein pVHL, which is part of an ubiquitin ligase complex, thus targeting the HIF-1α subunit for degradation by the proteasome.
18366759:6	The hydroxylation on the asparagine prevents HIF-1α-CBP/p300 interaction.
18366759:7	In low oxygen conditions, HIF-1α is no longer modified and is thus stabilized.
18366759:8	HIF-1α then translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with ARNT.
18366759:9	The products of HIF-1 target genes allow the cell to adapt to the hypoxic conditions . 
Regions of hypoxia are evidenced within many solid tumors and the extent of tumor hypoxia is thought to be an important prognostic factor influencing tumor progression, resistance to therapy and overall patient survival [ - ].
18366759:10	A molecular explanation of these hypoxia-induced effects includes increased anaerobic glycolysis, induction of angiogenesis and increased expression of drug export pumps, e.g. MDR1 . Many of these processes are regulated by HIF-1 . 
If mild hypoxia is rather pro-survival, it must be noted however that severe or prolonged hypoxia can lead to cell death, mainly through an apoptotic pathway . HIF-1 seems to play a major role in this process by inducing p53 stabilization , overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as BNIP3  or HGTD-P  as well as Bax translocation . 
It is thus apparent that hypoxia can either initiate apoptosis and cell death or prevent cell death by provoking an adaptive response facilitating cell proliferation and tumor growth . Considering that HIF-1 induces the expression of both pro-survival and cell death inducing genes, it is thus crucial to understand the fine tuning regulation that makes decision between life and death.
18366759:11	Similarly, the influence of hypoxia on apoptosis resistance to radio- and chemotherapy still needs deeper understanding.
18366759:12	The aim of this study was (i) to investigate the effect of hypoxia on the apoptosis induced by a drug used in chemotherapy, (ii) to define a molecular profiling of cancer cell response to this drug under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and (iii) to investigate the putative role of HIF-1 in these processes.
18366759:13	Gene expression patterns were then correlated with the activity of several transcription factors including HIF-1 and p53 in order to define molecular pathway involved in the cellular response.
18366759:14	We used etoposide as the apoptosis inducer.
18366759:15	Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces double strand breaks in DNA, thus leading to the activation of p53 and apoptosis .
18366759:16	Results 
Discussion 
A major drawback of the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapeutic agents is the development of resistance.
18366759:17	Besides the overexpression of ABC transporters and the selection of mutated cells whose apoptotic process is deficient, hypoxia has been shown to impair the effect of these molecules [ , ].
18366759:18	Indeed, while severe and prolonged hypoxia may initiate apoptosis, cells often adapt to mild hypoxia and survive.
18366759:19	Hypoxia by itself can also prevent apoptosis induced by several agents such as the ones used in chemotherapy .
18366759:20	However, the exact mechanisms responsible for this protective effect of hypoxia still remain elusive.
18366759:21	Using a simple in vitro experimental model with hepatoma HepG2 cells as an example of cancer cells and etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent used in clinic, we demonstrated that etoposide did indeed induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells and that hypoxia effectively prevents cell death (Fig. ).
18366759:22	Similar protective effects of hypoxia have also been reported for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells , for cisplatin and doxorubicin-induced cell death in non-small cell lung cancer  and for cisplatin-induced apoptosis in tubular cells . 
In this study, we aimed to define mechanisms initiated by hypoxia which are responsible for its protective effects.
18366759:23	Gene expression data evidenced several pro- and anti-apoptotic genes whose expression was upregulated by etoposide with the expression of some of them being further modulated by hypoxia.
18366759:24	As a DNA damaging reagent, etoposide has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines harboring either wildtype, like HepG2 cells, or mutated p53 .
18366759:25	Although the entire signaling pathway is not yet known, one clearly involves p53 . Our data indeed evidenced upregulation of p53 target genes such as GADD45, BAX, MDM2, CDKN1A (p21), GPX1 and TNFRSF6 (Fas).
18366759:26	The expression of these genes was also shown to be enhanced after etoposide treatment in U2-OS cells, that also contain wildtype p53, in another DNA microarray study . Another cDNA array analysis performed in p53 mutated cells, HL60, identified 40 genes differentially expressed by etoposide including MCL1 and JUN . The expression of these genes is thus clearly p53 independent in this case.
18366759:27	Their expression has also been observed to increase in our study.
18366759:28	Hypoxia alone also strongly influenced gene expression.
18366759:29	Besides known HIF-1 target genes like BNIP3 , MCL1 , JUN  or aldolase , other genes were also upregulated, such as CLK1 encoding a kinase, IGFBP4 and BIRC2 3 and 4 encoding different inhibitors of apoptosis.
18366759:30	Moreover, hypoxia also down- or up-regulated the expression of some of the etoposide responsive genes respectively IGFBP4, BAX, BAK1, MDM2, CDKN1A, GPX and CLK1 MCL1 . On the other hand, it had no effect on the expression of others like TNFRSF6, GADD45A and BIRC3 . We conclude from these observations that one putative mechanism by which hypoxia diminishes the etoposide-induced apoptosis could be through an inhibition of the upregulation of BAX and BAK1 two pro-apoptotic genes.
18366759:31	Erler et al  showed that hypoxia alone could decrease Bax (and Bid) expression and that this downregulation could participate to the cell sensitivity to etoposide.
18366759:32	This is in accordance with our results.
18366759:33	All together, these results revealed two candidate genes which could be responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of hypoxia.
18366759:34	The effects reported by Erler et al  occur via HIF-1 dependent and independent pathways.
18366759:35	Similarly, the changes in gene expression described in Table suggest p53 dependent and independent mechanisms triggered by etoposide while hypoxia also exerts effects which may depend on HIF-1 but also on other transcription factors.
18366759:36	We thus investigated in the second part of the work, the activity of 10 transcription factors.
18366759:37	The findings, summarized in Table suggest that both etoposide and hypoxia alone or in combination profoundly affected the activity of numerous transcription factors, and this differentially according to the factor.
18366759:38	Of note is the profile of p53 activity: p53 was activated by etoposide, inhibited by hypoxia and displayed an intermediate activity when both treatments were applied together, indicating that hypoxia diminished the etoposide-induced p53 activation.
18366759:39	On the other hand, hypoxia strongly activated HIF-1 and this activation was not affected by etoposide.
18366759:40	Complex regulation also occurred for AP-1, probably involving different subunits and with a maximal activity in the presence of etoposide and hypoxia.
18366759:41	There is mounting evidence that HIF-1 mediates cell survival and apoptosis resistance both under hypoxic and normoxic conditions [ - ].
18366759:42	This is largely due to alterations in cellular energy metabolism.
18366759:43	GLUT-1 expression regulation is one such example . Here, we showed that HIF-1α silencing prevented the protective effect of hypoxia against etoposide-induced apoptosis, which is in line with these previous reports.
18366759:44	Moreover, this sensitization was correlated with the loss of the effect of hypoxia on BAK1 expression i.e. hypoxia inhibits the etoposide-induced increase in BAK1 expression which is parallel to the inhibition of apoptosis while HIF-1α siRNA blocked both.
18366759:45	All together, these results suggest that it is probably by regulating Bak expression that HIF-1 induces, at least in part, cell resistance.
18366759:46	It has to be mentioned that we failed to observe such a sensitizing effect of HIF-1α siRNA in a previous work , probably because the effect of HIF-1α silencing previously achieved was not high enough.
18366759:47	Simple comparison was made by hand aimed to highline parallelism between variation in gene expression and transcription factor activation in order to determine which factor targets which gene.
18366759:48	One example of such a correlation is the additive effect of hypoxia and etoposide on the overexpression of MCL1 and CLK1 with the maximal activity of AP-1 in these conditions.
18366759:49	Similarly, expression pattern of IGFBP4, BAX, BAK1, MDM2, CDKN1A and GPX1 looks parallel to the profile of p53 activity.
18366759:50	However, with regard to the complexity of the changes observed in gene expression, knowing that transcription factors could interact one with each other, e.g. HIF-1 and p53  or HIF-1 and AP-1 , unbiaised cluster analyses were performed to evidence other unexpected correlations.
18366759:51	The results indicate that neither AP-1 activity, nor c-myc activity did correlate with the expression of genes detectable with the array.
18366759:52	On the other hand, cluster 7 correlates HIF-1 activity but also CREB/ATF-2 activity, with the changes in the expression of ING and MAP2K1 but also of MCL1, BNIP3 and JUN three known HIF-1 target genes.
18366759:53	Expected findings were also obtained in cluster 8 where a correlation exists between p53 DNA binding activity, p53 transcriptional activity and the expression of p53 target genes e.g. CDKN1A, GPX1 and PCNA .
18366759:54	However, other p53 target genes ( BAX, MDM2, GADD45A ) are clustered in cluster 9 together with the profile of NF-kB activity and the expression profile of NF-kB target genes ( BIRC3 and BIRC2 ).
18366759:55	Cluster 1 correlates the expression profiles of genes whose function in apoptosis is less clear and does not contain any transcription factor activity profile.
18366759:56	Further investigation will be needed to unravel the identity of the exact factor(s) responsible for the overexpression of these genes in the different conditions.
18366759:57	Our results indicated that in our experimental conditions, (1 % O 2), hypoxia does not lead to NF-kB activation in HepG2 cells.
18366759:58	There are reports in the literature reporting NF-kB activation under hypoxia in different cell types: macrophages , neutrophils , endothelial cells  as well as cancer cells . The exact mechanism responsible for NF-kB activation under hypoxia is not clear but it may involve ROS .
18366759:59	However, there are also other reports that show that NF-kB is activated during the reoxygenation phase following a previous hypoxia incubation period and in these cases, ROS are clearly involved in NF-kB activation BUT there is NO activation of NF-kB during the hypoxia phase [ - ].
18366759:60	In conclusion, according to the experimental conditions and probably the cell types, hypoxia does or does not activate NF-kB but the exact mechanisms for this fine tuning are not yet known.
18366759:61	Finally, in order to delineate putative pathways involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of hypoxia, "phenotypic" profiles for caspase activity and DNA fragmentation were added for the cluster analysis.
18366759:62	This new analysis generated different clusters than the previous one.
18366759:63	DNA fragmentation profile correlates with the expression pattern of three p53 target genes (cluster 6), one of them being involved in DNA repair ( GADD45A ).
18366759:64	On the other hand, caspase activity profile was clustered with p53 DNA binding activity and with the expression pattern of other p53 target genes among which is BAX and BAK1 . The reason why p53 transcriptional activity profile is not clustered in the same group is not known.
18366759:65	It is intriguing to remark that up- and down-regulation of BIRC2 and BIRC3 which are anti-apoptotic genes, also correlates with caspase 3 activity profile, hence with the apoptotic state of the cells.
18366759:66	Similarly, HIF-1 activity correlated with the overexpression pattern of BNIP3 which encodes a pro-apoptotic protein but also of MCL1 which encodes an anti-apoptotic protein.
18366759:67	However, HIF-1 activity did not correlate with any "phenotypic" profile.
18366759:68	These results suggest that it is probably a finely regulated balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins that eventually tilts the cell fate towards life or death.
18366759:69	It must also be noted that the changes in mRNA expression induced by etoposide and/or hypoxia may not always be reflected in the actual protein levels.
18366759:70	An interesting hypothesis is that HIF-1 could directly influence p53.
18366759:71	We investigated the effect of HIF-1α siRNA on p53 mRNA level and on its activity by measuring the expression of some of its target genes (mRNA level for BAX and GPX1 ).
18366759:72	It has to be mentioned that it is not possible to assess the effect of HIF-1α siRNA on p53 protein level (hence on its DNA binding activity): indeed the protein HIF-1α is only present under hypoxia conditions while p53 is markedly downregulated.
18366759:73	Regarding p53 mRNA level, neither etoposide, nor hypoxia did influence this level.
18366759:74	Moreover, HIF-1α siRNA had no effect either.
18366759:75	Regarding p53 activity, the expression of its target genes (e.g. GPX1 and BAX mRNA) was increased in the presence of etoposide and decreased under hypoxia alone.
18366759:76	This expression remained very low under hypoxia when etoposide was added.
18366759:77	There was no effect of HIF-1α siRNA on p53 target genes in any of these conditions (see Table ).
18366759:78	From these results, we concluded that the effect of hypoxia on p53 is not mediated by HIF-1.
18366759:79	Our results indicate that under hypoxia, BAK1 may be downregulated through a HIF-dependent pathway while BAX is not.
18366759:80	Since an inhibition of HIF-1 relieved the protection against the hypoxia-induced inhibition of etoposide-induced apoptosis, which occurred in parallel to a re-expression of BAK1 we hypothesis that HIF-1-dependent BAK1 expression may be involved in the protection brought by hypoxia.
18366759:81	It does not exclude that hypoxia exerts its effect via other mechanisms.
18366759:82	Indeed, a clear inhibition of p53 is observed under hypoxia, as well as of BAX expression, that both can also participate to the protection observed under hypoxia.
18366759:83	These two effects are however HIF-1-independent, since that still occurred when HIF-1 was inhibited.
18366759:84	In conclusion, our data evidenced complex changes in the activity of numerous transcription factors and in the expression of various pro- and anti-apoptotic genes induced by etoposide and/or hypoxia.
18366759:85	However, a system biology approach helped to define putative pathways that may be responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of hypoxia, one of them being the inhibition of p53 activation and hence of the expression of some of its targets genes.
18366759:86	BAX and more probably BAK1 are interesting candidates which can transduce the effect of hypoxia on HIF-1 and p53 activity and its actual effect on the induction of apoptosis.
18366759:87	Additional studies are now needed to evaluate the exact implication of these proteins.

21611164:0	Introduction 
By far the most common kind of language use is conversation . In conversation, utterances are produced spontaneously.
21611164:1	That is, they are “conceived and composed by their speakers even as they are spoken” (p.
21611164:2	136).
21611164:3	One consequence of this is that spontaneous speech contains disfluencies.
21611164:4	These are generally defined as “phenomena that interrupt the flow of speech and do not add propositional content to an utterance” (p.
21611164:5	709).
21611164:6	They include pauses, interruptions (midphrase or midword), repeated words and phrases, restarted sentences, words with elongated pronunciations, such as the pronounced thee and a as ay and fillers such as uh and um . Such disruptions are very frequent: Averaging across a n um ber of studies, and excluding silent hesitations, it has been estimated that disfluency in spontaneous speech affects about 6 per 100 words .
21611164:7	At first glance, it would seem that the many disfluencies in spontaneous speech present a formidable challenge to the speech perception system, because disfluencies result in strings of words that are not grammatically correct and strings of sounds that are not words.
21611164:8	This view that disfluencies are ‘noise’ and present obstacles to perception (p.
21611164:9	275) is probably the reason that radio broadcasters tend to edit out disfluencies from interviews and that the written media tend to omit disfluencies from their renditions of people's speech .
21611164:10	It may also be one of the reasons that most studies on spoken language comprehension have used idealized, fluent utterances.
21611164:11	However, the small number of studies that have investigated the effect of disfluencies on word or sentence comprehension converge on the opposite conclusion, namely that under some circumstances, disfluencies can in fact help the listener – . There may be several reasons why disfluencies can facilitate comprehension (see below).
21611164:12	This article investigates one property of disfluencies that might make them helpful, namely that they delay the onset of the following word.
21611164:13	Earlier studies have shown benefits of disfluencies on both participants' comprehensibility ratings of sentences and on on-line processing measures.
21611164:14	For example, listeners rate utterances including self-repairs as more comprehensible when those repairs are preceded by pauses . In on-line tasks, participants are quicker to identify a ‘correct’ repair word ( orange ) following either a between-word interruption ( yellow – orange ), or a mid-word interruption with or without a filler ( yel – uh – orange yel – orange ), compared to fluent controls . The quickest identifications are in cases where the interruption includes a filler.
21611164:15	These findings strongly suggest that pauses and fillers help the identification of upcoming words.
21611164:16	This conclusion is partially supported by a word-spotting study which shows that both English and Dutch listeners are faster to identify a target word in a carrier sentence when it follows an uh in comparison to a control condition without the uh . In a comparable set of conditions with or without an um there is no effect.
21611164:17	Why would (some) fillers facilitate auditory word recognition?
21611164:18	On one account fillers ‘signal’ delays in speech, with specific fillers signaling specific lengths of delay.
21611164:19	The fillers could therefore heighten attention for upcoming speech.
21611164:20	In particular, this account rests on the assumption that um signals a longer delay than uh does.
21611164:21	This assumption is supported by an analysis of transcriber-rated pause lengths in a speech corpus . Given this difference, uh is predicted to signal a relatively short delay, and it is functional for the speech perception system to immediately heighten attention for upcoming speech.
21611164:22	But in the case of um heightening attention is less functional, because there is no reason to expect the next word anytime soon . In short, on this account, the speech perception system is sensitive to the patterns of delays that tend to co-occur with fillers in natural speech, so that attention can be allocated in a way that is appropriate to the particular filler that occurs.
21611164:23	However, it is also possible that the benefits for perception emerge from the fact that disfluencies like uh and um and any silent pauses preceding or following the filler, considerably delay target word onset themselves.
21611164:24	For example, in (Experiment 2) the average duration of um was 615 ms; the average durations of preceding and following pauses were 592 ms and 412 ms respectively.
21611164:25	According to the delay hypothesis tested here, temporal delay facilitates word recognition.
21611164:26	Anecdotal evidence suggests that speakers who are difficult to follow will be easier to understand when they speak more slowly (presumably, slowing speech affects pausing).
21611164:27	Furthermore, there are theoretical reasons why a delay in word onset might facilitate word recognition.
21611164:28	For example, delays might make the listener's segmentation problem easier, because speech sounds spanning a delay most likely do not belong to the same word.
21611164:29	It is also possible that delays help top-down processes: The more time passes, the more time there is to make top-down predictions about the next word.
21611164:30	Finally, it may be the case that attention builds up over the course of any delay.
21611164:31	The delay hypothesis predicts that um like uh should aid word recognition and therefore appears to conflict with previous findings . But as noted above, in that study there were relatively lengthy silent pauses preceding and following the uhs and um s, and these pauses were left intact in the control stimuli.
21611164:32	As a result, there were delays in the disfluent stimuli, but also in the ‘fluent’ stimuli.
21611164:33	According to the delay hypothesis, these silent pauses in the fluent stimuli would themselves facilitate word recognition, so that the further delay from having a filler would do little to facilitate this process even more.
21611164:34	To test the delay hypothesis, we conducted three experiments that assessed the effects of three types of delays on auditory word recognition.
21611164:35	In all experiments, listeners viewed displays of two images and listened to instructions to press a button corresponding to one of them.
21611164:36	In the delay conditions, listeners heard an instruction with a delay immediately before the target word.
21611164:37	In the control conditions, the instruction also contained a delay, but earlier in the sentence.
21611164:38	This led to instructions like those in (1).
21611164:39	(1a) Now press the button for the <delay> <target>, please

We opted for a control condition with an early delay, so that the total time to target was constant across conditions, and so that both experimental and control stimuli contained exactly the same auditory materials (albeit in a different order).
21611164:40	Thus, any difference between experimental and control conditions can only be ascribed to the difference in the position of the delay.
21611164:41	Note that instructions with an invariant syntactic structure and invariant lexical content (bar the target item) have also been used in eyetracking experiments . Additionally, to ensure maximal comparability across experiments we used the same acoustic token of the carrier sentence, and delays of exactly the same length in every condition of all experiments.
21611164:42	Experiment 1 examined the effect of a naturalistic disfluency, namely um . Experiment 2 tested whether any facilitative effect on word recognition is a specific property of fillers like um or whether silent pauses can also help word recognition (as predicted by the delay hypothesis).
21611164:43	Experiment 3 tested whether there is also facilitation when the delay is clearly not a naturalistic disfluency.
21611164:44	We therefore used an artificially generated sine wave tone.
21611164:45	In each experiment, upon hearing an auditory instruction naming one of two depicted objects, participants had to respond by pressing one of two buttons (corresponding to the left-hand or right-hand object).
21611164:46	Half of the instructions included a late delay, just before the object was named, and the other half included an earlier delay.
21611164:47	To establish that the paradigm had sufficient power to reveal reaction time effects on auditory word recognition, each experiment also included a task difficulty manipulation.
21611164:48	In the difficult condition, the target picture had a low-frequency (LF) name and was visually blurred.
21611164:49	In the easy condition, the target picture had a high-frequency (HF) name and was visually intact.
21611164:50	Thus the two factors manipulated orthogonally in a within-participants design were delay and task difficulty.
21611164:51	In each experiment, recordings were made of times (relative to the onset of the target item name) taken for accurate responses to the instructions.
21611164:52	Results 
We analysed our experiments using Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects models.
21611164:53	Effects, and their probabilities, were estimated using 10,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo samples.
21611164:54	Discussion 
In each of three experiments we found clear effects of delays on word recognition.
21611164:55	It did not matter whether such delays were filled with um (Experiment 1), were silent (Experiment 2), or were filled with a tone that was clearly not part of speech (Experiment 3).
21611164:56	A conclusion that stands out from this work is that any delay in word onset can help word recognition.
21611164:57	This has an important theoretical implication.
21611164:58	The current data certainly do not rule out that listeners are sensitive to the distributional properties of speech following fillers like uh um and the like, so that they can predict when the next word will follow or even what word will follow.
21611164:59	However, our data do show that it is not necessary to postulate such sensitivity.
21611164:60	The benefits of fillers on word recognition can just as easily be explained in terms of the delay that such fillers create.
21611164:61	Our findings contrast with an earlier study by Fox Tree which showed an uh -advantage, but no um -advantage in a word-spotting task .
21611164:62	This was interpreted as a consequence of the differences in delay that uh and um would signal .
21611164:63	However, the present study did find an effect of um . A possible reason for this difference in findings is that the ums in Fox Tree's study were preceded and followed by lengthy silent pauses, which were left in the “fluent” control stimuli.
21611164:64	Our Experiment 2 shows that silent delays also facilitate word recognition.
21611164:65	This may have masked any effect of um in the earlier study.
21611164:66	It is true of course that our study differed from that of Fox Tree in several further ways.
21611164:67	The most striking difference is probably that Fox Tree used naturalistic utterances, with different carrier sentences and different uhs and ums on every disfluent trial, whereas we used one and the same carrier sentence, and always used the same delay (i.e., same um silence, or tone).
21611164:68	Fox Tree's choice of stimuli undoubtedly promoted ecological validity more than ours, but this of course traded-off with experimental control.
21611164:69	Whereas our design allows us to directly compare the effects of different types of delay (because everything else was held constant across experiments, except for the random factor participants), it is rather difficult to directly compare Fox Tree's uh and um conditions, because the carrier sentences and target words were different, the uhs and ums varied in length, and the pauses before and after um varied too . 
Two sets of studies have, however, used different types of delays in circumstances which allow for direct comparison of their effects.
21611164:70	In one study, participants were asked to judge the grammaticality of recorded utterances which included spoken disfluencies ( uh uh ) or “environmental noises” (such as dog barks) in positions which were expected either to facilitate or interfere with understanding . In each of two experiments, the effects of environmental noise were shown to be effectively the same as those of disfluency.
21611164:71	A second set of studies examined ERP responses to words following silent and disfluent uh delays.
21611164:72	In each case, the N400 component associated with contextually less predictable words was attenuated following a delay.
21611164:73	Taken together, these studies suggest that different types of hesitation can be shown to have similar effects across a variety of paradigms and materials, providing converging evidence that the form of a delay to the spoken signal may be less important than the time taken.
21611164:74	One potential caveat with such studies is that they tend to repeat acoustic tokens in order to achieve experimental control.
21611164:75	In the present study our use of a fixed token of the carrier sentence, and a fixed token of um may have led the participants to process the um and following words in ways that differ from the normal listening situation.
21611164:76	Specifically, in normal listening situations, listeners might interpret um and the like as a signal of upcoming delay (which heightens attention in ways appropriate for the ‘meanings’ of the particular disfluencies).
21611164:77	However, because in our experiments the target word almost immediately followed the um and because listener sensitivity to session-local distributional properties of um would gradually overwrite their global sensitivities, listeners would, in the course of a session, stop expecting a further delay following um . Including the effects of trial number in our analyses provides a direct test of whether this caveat threatens our conclusions.
21611164:78	Specifically, any account on which listeners pick up on the properties of our materials would need to further assume that the effects of delays change over the course of the experimental session.
21611164:79	As is often the case in reaction time experiments, the analyses showed that responses became somewhat faster over the course of the experiment, but in none of the experiments was there an interaction between item number and delay, showing that participants' responses to delays did not change over time.
21611164:80	Our main conclusion is that delays in word onset facilitate word recognition, and that such facilitation is independent of the type of delay.
21611164:81	There are several reasons why a delay in itself might help.
21611164:82	On one account, delays help low-level speech segmentation processes.
21611164:83	Because running speech often contains no clear word boundaries, the segmentation process has to figure out where one word ends and the next one begins, as illustrated by the classic example I scream for ice cream . Obviously, this segmentation problem can be reduced when there are delays between words.
21611164:84	However, we do not think a segmentation account can explain our results.
21611164:85	In particular, in our experimental condition, the um always occurred between the and the target item.
21611164:86	If the segmentation account is correct, then listeners should encounter difficulties segmenting the string of sounds consisting of the and the initial sound(s) of the target item.
21611164:87	The cohort of words starting with the however, is very small, and only contains words in which the schwa is followed by a /t/ (e.g., that ), an /m/ ( themselves ), or a /w/ ( the one ).
21611164:88	Only one target word ( tree ) started with one of those consonants and could therefore have led to segmentation problems.
21611164:89	Another reason why delay helps word recognition may be that delay allows time for any top-down processes to affect recognition processes.
21611164:90	Visual-world eyetracking experiments suggest that listeners, when hearing speech in a visual context, make linguistic predictions about upcoming references – . Given the ubiquity of NPs consisting of a determiner and noun in the language, it is possible that determiners lead to the prediction of nouns (and help subsequent identification of nouns), and that these predictions become more effective as more time passes.
21611164:91	Finally, it is possible that delays do not affect the mechanisms of word recognition themselves, but affect an attentional modulation of recognition processes.
21611164:92	On such an account, any delay in speech will lead to a transient increase in attention, so that the next word can be more readily identified.
21611164:93	Consistent with this account, it has been shown that stimuli containing an uh as compared to fluent controls, modulated the amplitude of the mismatch negativity and P300 components in the ERP signal .
21611164:94	It is well established that these components are sensitive to variations in attention.
21611164:95	Additionally, in subsequent memory tests, words that had followed uh were recalled better than control words, which is again consistent with an attentional account . 
Our findings support the perhaps counterintuitive conclusion that fillers like um can sometimes help (rather than hinder) listeners to identify spoken words.
21611164:96	But critically, the data show that the same is true for silent pauses and pauses filled with artificially generated tones.
21611164:97	It thus seems unnecessary to postulate listener sensitivity to the distributional properties of pause durations after fillers to explain why fillers help.
19077320:0	Background 
Vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, replicates solely in the cytoplasm of infected cells.
19077320:1	This physical autonomy is accompanied by genetic autonomy: the 192 kb DNA genome, encodes ~200 proteins involved in diverse aspects of the viral life cycle . A virally encoded transcriptional apparatus directs three temporally regulated phases of gene expression, and a virally encoded replication apparatus mediates genome replication and maturation.
19077320:2	A large number of proteins contribute to the complex process of morphogenesis, which culminates in the production of mature virions (MV) . Most MV remain within the cell, but a subset becomes enwrapped in two extra membranes derived from the Golgi apparatus or late endosomal compartment; these wrapped virions are then released by exocytosis as enveloped virions (EV) and mediate cell-to-cell and distal spread .
19077320:3	Finally, a significant number of the viral genes encode proteins that interface with the host.
19077320:4	Some of these proteins regulate intrinsic cellular responses to infection such as apoptosis and the antiviral response, whereas others represent extracellular mediators that interface with cytokines and cells of the immune system [ - ].
19077320:5	Comparison of the genomes of a large number of orthopoxviruses has led to the identification of ~90 genes that are fully conserved . These genes are therefore thought to encode the repertoire of proteins required for the poxviral life cycle.
19077320:6	A combination of genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches have enabled the functional characterization of most, but not all, of these genes.
19077320:7	One of the gene products that had not been studied in depth was the product of the I5L gene, which encodes a structural protein first identified as VP13 . I5 is one of ~75 structural proteins identified by proteomic analyses as localizing to either the membrane or core of the mature poxvirus virion [ - ].
19077320:8	Core proteins include structural proteins essential for the assembly of the virion core, the full complement of proteins required for mediating the early phase of gene expression, and virally encoded kinases and phosphatases.
19077320:9	The MV membrane contains ~20 proteins, many of which contribute to virion morphogenesis .
19077320:10	At least 11 membrane proteins are essential for virion entry [ - ], and others mediate the association of virions with GAGs or laminins on the cell surface [ - ].
19077320:11	Other membrane proteins appear to be dispensable in vitro but contribute to pathogenesis in vivo . Because our laboratory has a long-standing interest in virion morphogenesis and in the function of virion membrane proteins, we undertook an analysis of the I5 protein.
19077320:12	Methods 
Results and discussion 
Conclusion 
The 78 aa vaccinia-encoded I5 protein is highly hydrophobic and expressed at late times after infection.
19077320:13	I5 is found associated with intermediates in virion morphogenesis as well as mature virions.
19077320:14	The C' terminus of I5 is exposed on the surface of intact virions.
19077320:15	Repression of I5 expression has no apparent impact on the yield of infectious virus in either BSC40 cells or human diploid fibroblasts; the ability to isolate a virus deleted for the I5L gene supports the conclusion that it is dispensable for replication in tissue culture.

16848883:0	Background 
The term "nutraceutical" was first coined in 1989 as a contraction of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", and refers to a food compound that not only supplements the diet but also aids in the prevention and/or treatment of disease and/or disorder .
16848883:1	Similarly, functional foods contain at least one component, whether it be a nutrient or not, that affects a target function of the organism in a specific, positive way, thereby generating a physiological effect beyond its nutritional value . Functional food ingredients include probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and minerals, and can be found in such diverse products as fermented dairy products, sports drinks and chewing gum . Interest in and acceptance of functional foods is gaining impetus, for a number of reasons that include changing consumer demands and social attitudes, scientific evidence of the health benefits of particular ingredients and commercially driven interests to add value to existing products.
16848883:2	Consumer awareness on nutrition raises the demand for healthy food options, ideally delivered in a convenient form . Functional foods have a significant and growing global market with recent estimates indicating up to a $50 billion annual share .
16848883:3	Since Metchnikoff first theorised that fermented milk products provided health benefits, including longer life expectancy, these products have been viewed as "healthy" by consumers . In many modern societies fermented dairy products make up a substantial proportion of the total daily food consumption.
16848883:4	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are an industrially important group of micro-organisms used all over the world for centuries in a large variety of food fermentations, such as those of meat and vegetables, but undoubtedly with the major application in the dairy industry.
16848883:5	LAB have been shown to be ideal cell factories because the biosynthetic capacity and metabolic versatility of these bacteria is generally quite limited, their physiology is relatively simple, while their energy metabolism and biosynthesis processes are almost completely separated .
16848883:6	It has therefore been possible to exploit LAB for the production of many nutraceuticals . The dairy propionibacteria, especially P. freudenreichii ssp.
16848883:7	shermanii are the main ripening flora in Swiss-type cheeses, where they play a critical role in the development of the characteristic flavour and "eye" production . Propionibacteria are also used for the production of vitamin B12  and there is increasing interest in their potential use as probiotics . Considering the current widespread use of LAB and propionibacteria in the food industry, coupled with consumer demand for healthier foods, the potential to use these food grade microorganisms as "vitamin factories" was investigated.
16848883:8	Riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin produced by plants and many micro-organisms.
16848883:9	However, this biosynthetic capability is lacking in higher animals and they must therefore obtain this essential nutrient from their diet.
16848883:10	Riboflavin is the precursor of the enzyme cofactors FMN and FAD, which are vital in many of the body's enzymatic functions for the transfer of electrons in oxidation-reduction reactions.
16848883:11	Riboflavin deficiency is most commonly seen in developing countries , among the elderly , and in chronic alcoholics . Clinical symptoms of riboflavin deficiency are rarely seen in developed countries but the subclinical stage of deficiency, characterised by a change in biochemical indices, is seen in a significant portion of the population of these nations as exemplified by Ireland . Riboflavin deficiency mainly manifests itself clinically in the mucocutaneous surfaces of the mouth, through the occurrence of cracks at the corners, and inflammation of the lips and tongue , but deficiency is also associated with vision deterioration and growth failure.
16848883:12	In recent years the vitamin has been found to be effective in the treatment of migraine , malaria  and Parkinson's disease . Riboflavin is commonly obtained in the diet from meat, eggs, fortified cereals and green leafy vegetables, in addition to dairy products, which contribute most significantly to riboflavin intake . 
Riboflavin has been traditionally synthesised for food and feed fortification by chemical means but in more recent years biotechnological processes employing various bacteria, yeast and fungi have been found to be commercially competitive and are replacing chemical synthesis .
16848883:13	One of these biotechnological processes employs Bacillus ( B .) subtilis as the riboflavin cell factory and much work has been carried out in characterising the vitamin's biosynthetic pathway in this organism (For a review see ).
16848883:14	For B. subtilis and Lactococcus ( L .) lactis it has been shown that mutants that are isolated on the basis of their resistance to the toxic riboflavin analogue roseoflavin also exhibit a riboflavin-overproduction phenotype . Recently, it was demonstrated that fermented dairy products produced either with a roseoflavin-resistant strain of P. freudenreichii or L. lactis was able to improve growth and riboflavin status of riboflavin-depleted animals . 
The current study reports on the isolation of roseoflavin-resistant mutants of various strains used in the food industry and analysis of their resulting riboflavin-overproducing phenotype.
16848883:15	In the case of Lb.
16848883:16	plantarum and Lc. mesenteroides the mutations responsible for riboflavin overproduction were identified and the possible effects of these mutations on transcription of the rib operon are discussed.
16848883:17	In the case of P. freudenreichii the riboflavin-overproducing strains were examined in comparison to a control strain in a yoghurt production model.
16848883:18	Results 
Discussion 
The work presented in this study demonstrates the broad applicability of the strategy to isolate strains with enhanced vitamin B2 production characteristics using sub-inhibitory levels of roseoflavin.
16848883:19	The resultant strains are made through a non-recombinant method and may therefore be readily applicable in an industrial setting.
16848883:20	Various biotechnological processes have been developed for industrial scale riboflavin biosynthesis using the ascomycetes Ashbya gossypii different yeasts and the bacterium B. subtilis . The latter organism has been successfully employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification purposes.
16848883:21	However, since this production procedure involved a genetically recombinant organism regulatory approval was required where substantial equivalence of the product to non-recombinant riboflavin had to be established, while no DNA from the production strain was allowed to be present in the final product . The purpose of the present study was not to develop strains which would challenge these already available processes, but rather to look at the potential to isolate strains with an improved riboflavin production phenotype that could replace the riboflavin-consuming parent strains in traditional food fermentation processes thus improving the bioavailability of riboflavin.
16848883:22	The Lc. mesenteroides strain, NCDO 2028 used in this study was originally isolated from beetroot silage, and was chosen as a representative of a species, which has many varied industrial applications in the dairy industry and various plant and vegetable fermentation processes [ - ].
16848883:23	Lb.
16848883:24	plantarum used in a large number of fermentation processes was chosen as another candidate.
16848883:25	This organism is found in many diverse environments, owing to its metabolic flexibility . In general, descriptions of the strain's nutritional requirements indicate that riboflavin is not required for growth, indicative of a functional riboflavin biosynthetic pathway . Lb.
16848883:26	plantarum NCDO 1752, a pickled cabbage isolate, is capable of growth in the absence of the vitamin illustrating its ability to synthesise the vitamin.
16848883:27	However, in the course of this work it was revealed that the sequenced strain of Lb.
16848883:28	plantarum WCFS1 does not contain a functional rib operon and consequently is unable to grow in the absence of exogenous riboflavin . Two strains of P. freudenreichii (both isolated from cheese), one subspecies freudenreichii (NIZO B374) and one subspecies shermanii (NIZO B369) were selected from the NIZO culture collection and the resistance strategy was applied also to this strain.
16848883:29	All isolated mutants from these two subspecies were shown to be riboflavin overproducers.
16848883:30	The successful application of the roseoflavin resistance strategy in three diverse bacterial species shows that it is a readily employable system in an industrial setting to isolate starter strains that produce and secrete vitamin B2.
16848883:31	This is particularly appealing when one considers that some yoghurt cultures have been shown to actually decrease the concentration of riboflavin in some products due to their consumption of the vitamin . In a simultaneously performed collaborative study it was demonstrated that a fermented dairy product produced with P. freudenreichii B2336 was able to improve growth and riboflavin status of riboflavin-depleted animals .
16848883:32	This proves that the riboflavin produced in yoghurt fermentation is available as a nutrient.
16848883:33	Although not all spontaneous or induced mutations causing riboflavin overproduction in B.
16848883:34	subtilis have been analysed in detail, the characterised roseoflavin-induced mutations in this organism have been located either in ribC the bifunctional flavokinase/FAD synthetase, which converts riboflavin to FMN and FAD , or in the regulatory region upstream of the rib operon .
16848883:35	This knowledge facilitated the identification of the mutations present in the roseoflavin-resistant LAB strains.
16848883:36	No mutations were identified in the ribC homologue of any of the roseoflavin-resistant strains, but instead all characterised mutants were found to contain mutations in the regulatory leader region upstream of the rib operon.
16848883:37	In both species different point mutations were identified, which were shown to differentially affect the level of riboflavin overproduction.
16848883:38	Additionally, for both LAB species spontaneous roseoflavin-resistant mutants were isolated containing various deletions in the regulatory region of the rib operon.
16848883:39	It is expected that such mutations are extremely stable.
16848883:40	Furthermore, in P. freudenreichii it was shown that after sixty generations in non-selective media the riboflavin-overproducing phenotype does not revert to the wildtype phenotype.
16848883:41	In analogy to what is known for the regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis in B.
16848883:42	subtilis and L. lactis [ , ] it is assumed that also in the species used in this study regulation of the rib operon would be mediated by a termination-antitermination mechanism resulting from two different folding options of the RFN element upstream of the operon in response to riboflavin or FMN.
16848883:43	RFN elements have been identified in the rib operon leader region of Lc.
16848883:44	mesenteroides (Fig. ) and Lb. plantarum (Fig. ) using RFAM .
16848883:45	It is likely from the position of the mutations that they affect the stability of the terminator structure making it less energetically favourable for it to form, thus allowing continued transcription of the rib operon.
16848883:46	In order to study the potential usefulness of such strains in an industrial setting a pilot yoghurt trial was set up to compare addition of P. freudenreichii NIZO B374 or its riboflavin-overproducing derivative B2336 either 24 hours prior to the addition of the starter culture or simultaneously with the starter culture.
16848883:47	Sequential addition of strain NIZO B2336 to the yoghurt was found to double the concentration of riboflavin in the final product in comparison to yoghurt containing the non-producing wildtype propionibacterium.
16848883:48	Furthermore, the mutant showed no differences in comparison to the wildtype strain regarding final cell numbers of the starter culture or final pH of the product.
16848883:49	This illustrates that there is a clear benefit of using such riboflavin-overproducing strains in fermentations as it increases the vitamin content of the final product, thus making it more appealing to consumers.
16848883:50	Sequential inoculation of the propionibacteria was also found to counteract acidification resulting in a milder product, which could be used as another positive selling point.
16848883:51	The basic concepts of nutrition are changing.
16848883:52	The traditional idea of an 'adequate diet', which provides enough nutrients to ensure the individual's survival and meet metabolic needs as well as satisfying hunger is now obsolete.
16848883:53	More and more emphasis is being placed on the need for foods to promote health, improve well being and reduce the risk of illness through the adoption of the concept of an "optimum diet" . Selection of strains that have been subjected to uncontrolled genetic alterations has been used in the dairy industry to improve certain intrinsic characteristics of the fermented end product.
16848883:54	For example, a spontaneous IS element mediated deletion of the lacZ gene altered lactose metabolism resulting in a decreased fermentation of the sugar.
16848883:55	Yoghurt made using this strain is not affected by further acidification . Strains modified by induced mutations are considered non-GMO and are acceptable for deliberate release in the European Union . Such strategies could have important implications for food fermentations as industry constantly strives to increase the marketability of their products to more health conscious consumers in an increasingly competitive market.

17760502:0	Introduction 
Current methods to measure directly the frequency at which human germline nucleotide substitutions arise each generation include the analysis of sporadic cases of human autosomal dominant or sex-linked diseases  and DNA analysis of sperm  . Studies of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2) using both approaches [ , ] have been useful in understanding the origins of Apert syndrome.
17760502:1	Individuals born with this condition are characterized by a number of features, including prematurely fused cranial sutures and fused fingers and toes (see accession numbers).
17760502:2	This dominantly inherited disease arises with a frequency between 10 −5 and 10 −6  virtually always due to a spontaneous germline mutation,.
17760502:3	Surprisingly, the high incidence of Apert syndrome cannot be explained by mutations at numerous nucleotide sites in the FGFR2 gene leading to the disease phenotype.
17760502:4	In fact, greater than 98% of Apert syndrome cases arise by transversion mutations at only two sites (C755G and C758G).
17760502:5	The C755G mutation is located at a CpG [dinucleotide containing a C followed by a G (5′ to 3′)] site (leading to a serine-to-tryptophan substitution at amino acid 252) and accounts for two-thirds of the cases . Based on what is known about the frequency of transversion mutations at neutral CpG sites since humans and chimpanzees last had a common ancestor  and mutations at many human disease loci , the C755G mutation frequency is 100–1,000-fold greater than expected.
17760502:6	One intuitive explanation is that this nucleotide simply has a higher than average chance of undergoing a base substitution (mutation hot spot model).
17760502:7	Alternatively, positive selection for diploid germline cells carrying the mutation has also been proposed [ , ].
17760502:8	In fact, the authors of one study  argued that positive selection on mutant spermatogonia was required to explain their results on sperm mutation frequencies.
17760502:9	We show, however, that this same data is also compatible with the mutation hot spot model ( and ).
17760502:10	With specific regard to human germline selection being responsible for the high C755G mutation frequency, it has been said that “Surprising hypotheses call for unusually strong evidence” . We have therefore developed a new approach to distinguish between the selection and hot spot models that goes beyond sperm analysis.

In theory, heritable nucleotide substitutions can arise in any germline cell during scheduled DNA replication or in nondividing cells by means of error-prone DNA repair (see ).
17760502:12	Two observations support the importance of the cell division–dependent mutation process.
17760502:13	First, neutral germline mutations seem to arise 3–6-fold more frequently in males than females in many organisms, including humans (male-driven evolution, see ).
17760502:14	Second, a number of genetic conditions including Apert syndrome appear to increase in the offspring of men as they age (paternal age effect [ , , ]).
17760502:15	Both male-driven evolution and the paternal age effect can be explained by the cell division–dependent mutation process, because cell divisions of self-renewing spermatogonia occur throughout a man's life, whereas the cellular precursors of eggs (oogonia) cease replication during the fetal life of a female . 
We examined the molecular anatomy and frequency of the Apert syndrome C755G mutation in normal human testes to test whether the high mutation frequency was due to an exceptionally high C-to-G transversion mutation rate per cell division.
17760502:16	The results show that the observed C755G mutation frequency and distribution within the testes cannot be explained by this hot spot model ( p < 10 −6).
17760502:17	An alternate hypothesis to explain the high C755G mutation frequency argues that diploid premeiotic cells carrying the C755G mutation have a selective advantage over wild-type cells [ , ].
17760502:18	In one case , the authors cited the puzzling observation that the magnitude of the sex bias for the C755G Apert syndrome is at least 99-fold greater in the male germline than in the female germline , whereas estimates of male bias (male-driven evolution) using data on neutral mutations at many different sites would indicate only an ∼5-fold male preference [ , ].
17760502:19	Rare patients with multiple mutations in the FGFR2 gene that leads to Apert syndrome were also cited as support for a germline selection model .
17760502:20	Finally, in another study , the authors exploited a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to argue that selection acted on the C755G mutation (however, see and ).
17760502:21	In our experiments, we were not only able to clearly reject the hot spot model, but also we could show that modifying our model of germline development by incorporating a simple selection scheme led to predictions on mutation frequency and testis distribution consistent with our data.
17760502:22	This selection takes place on SrAp cells carrying the C755G mutations that arise at approximately the frequency expected from the existing data on neutral mutations . The selection model proposes that mutant adult SrAp occasionally divide symmetrically (inferred rate 1 out of 100 divisions on average, or approximately once every 4 y), whereas wild-type SrAp always undergo asymmetric self-renewal divisions.
17760502:23	Considering all of the published work [ , ] as well as our present results, it now seems very likely that positive selection can be a driving force acting to increase the germline mutation frequency in humans above the frequency at which spontaneous nucleotide substitutions arise.
17760502:24	We would like to emphasize that the type of selection we are discussing is on diploid premeiotic cells.
17760502:25	Previous proposals have suggested that C755G mutation bearing sperm may have a selective advantage over wild-type sperm [3, ].
17760502:26	Selection taking the form of competition among sperm is well known in plants and animals , and is even documented in primates .
17760502:27	However, for this particular mutation, the testis and epididymal sperm data we collected as well as data on ejaculated sperm ( and unpublished data) and Apert syndrome birth data  show similar mutation frequencies.
17760502:28	Therefore, while further selection on sperm is possible, we believe that the vast majority of the increase in mutation frequency is due to selection on the diploid premeiotic cells.
17760502:29	Why should a mutation that has a distinct selective disadvantage when present in all the cells of an organism have a selective advantage when present only in a small fraction of the germline cells?
17760502:30	It is worth noting here that achondroplasia, the most common cause of dwarfism, has many similarities to that of Apert syndrome (see ).
17760502:31	Virtually all of the new achondroplasia mutations arise in the male germline at one nucleotide site (G1138A) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene and with a mutation frequency even higher than the C755G mutation in FGFR2 . These common characteristics suggest that the G1138A mutation may also increase to such a high frequency by a selective mechanism [ , ].
17760502:32	It is interesting to note that both FGFR2 and FGFR3 are receptor tyrosine kinases and can influence downstream members of the signal transduction pathway (for a more detailed discussion see ).
17760502:33	Especially relevant may be the fact that some mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 (although usually not the specific mutations that cause Apert syndrome or achondroplasia) have been associated with certain cancers  and cancer susceptibility . 
Germline selection in diploid germ cells of animals was considered by the population geneticist Ian Hastings . He examined how mitotic gene conversion and somatic crossing over events in diploid germline cells of animals could lead to loss of heterozygosity of recessive alleles and the possibility of positive or negative selection on such alleles.
17760502:34	He calculated that selection against rare germline cells made homozygous for a recessive allele can effectively lower the transmission of the deleterious allele to offspring thereby reducing disadvantageous alleles entering the population and burdening it with reduced viability or fertility.
17760502:35	Using plausible models, this reduction in the mutational load could be as large as 100-fold.
17760502:36	Similarly, loss of heterozygosity could allow recessive alleles that conferred a germline advantage to be spread more quickly in the population.
17760502:37	Experimental literature on germline selection in premeiotic diploid cells in animals is very sparse (see  and references therein) but in one case, wild-type Drosophila cells were produced by a genetic trick in the germline of females heterozygous for a phenotypically recessive mutation and were found to have a proliferative selective advantage compared to the background heterozygous cells.
17760502:38	Hastings' analysis was primarily concerned with recessive alleles that were already polymorphic in the population.
17760502:39	But gain-of-function mutations that arise sporadically in the testis would behave in the same way, because a second event leading to loss of heterozygosity is not required for positive and negative selection to be effective.
17760502:40	A new gain-of-function mutation with a germline selective advantage will more likely be transmitted to the next generation, because the effective mutation frequency is elevated beyond the level that can be achieved by the mutation process alone.
17760502:41	A disadvantageous gain of function mutation would be less likely to be tested in the population if it were selected against in the germline.
17760502:42	Finally, Hastings realized that alleles conferring a selective advantage in the germline may be disadvantageous in the adult and might lead to “mitotic drive” systems that could increase the mutational load of a population.
17760502:43	Both Apert syndrome and achondroplasia may be examples of such a system, and additional examples of mutations of medical interest may also exist (see [ , ]).
17760502:44	The method we have developed can be used to test this hypothesis at any locus in many different species if a sufficiently sensitive mutation assay can be made available.
20396382:0	Introduction 
Obesity is a devastating health problem afflicting all ages, races and socioeconomic
   classes in both genders.
20396382:1	Over the past decade, only modest success has been achieved
   in combating the escalating prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome .
20396382:2	The
   current obesity epidemic may be attributed to many factors including environmental
   (e.g., caloric and nutrient intake), genetic and even evolutionary (e.g.,
   interaction between human biology and human culture over the long period of human
   evolution) .
20396382:3	With
   today's prolonged human lifespan, aging has also been considered as an
   obesogenic factor given the increased visceral fat associated with aging .
   Paradoxically, visceral fat accumulation may in turn influence longevity, thus
   prompting the speculation that obesity could be a condition of premature aging .
20396382:4	Although
   effective physiological adjustments are present to counterbalance the potentially
   detrimental health outcome of obesity such as altered respiratory
   mechanical/muscular function peculiar to the aging condition a number of
   obesity-associated comorbidities such as cancer, endocrine, cardiovascular and
   immune disorders may ultimately contribute to premature aging and the shortened
   lifespan.
20396382:5	Therefore, the concept of health promotion, especially on nutrition and
   life style, has become an important part of health care in older adults .
20396382:6	Among a wide array of comorbidities associated with obesity including type 2
   diabetes, hypertension, cancer and sleep apnea heart disease, which is
   mainly manifested by cardiac hypertrophy and compromised ventricular function, may
   lead to heart failure or premature death – . The
   pathophysiological alterations associated with establishing and perpetuating
   obesity-induced heart disease are complex but are becoming more clear, including the
   interaction of sympathetic overactivation and endothelial dysfunction . In an
   effort to better understand the pathophysiology of human obesity, several rodent
   models of obesity have been developed and implemented including high fat diet
   feeding and spontaneous mutants of the 16 KD obesity gene product leptin or its
   receptor such as ob / ob and
    db / db mice.
20396382:7	A common feature of these obese
   animal models is the overtly compromised cardiac contractile function associated
   with a marked increase in visceral fat and hyperinsulinemia – similar
   to human obesity.
20396382:8	Accumulating evidence has also implicated a role of the obese gene
   product leptin, which regulates food intake and energy expenditure, in the
   regulation of cardiac function, while the disruption of which contributes to
   obesity-associated cardiac contractile and morphometric defects .
20396382:9	Human
   circulating leptin levels are elevated in obesity, vascular and coronary heart
   diseases, favoring a contemporary perception of hyperleptinemia being an independent
   risk factor for cardiovascular diseases .
20396382:10	This notion is further
   supported by the experimental evidence that leptin may contribute to cardiac
   hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and thrombosis possibly through accumulation of
   reactive oxygen species , . Elevated leptin level or
   hyperleptinemia is correlated with hyperphagia, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia
   and hypertension, independent of total adiposity . Data from our lab
   revealed that leptin directly suppresses cardiomyocyte contraction and intracellular
    Ca 2+ handling through mechanism(s) related to endothelial
   nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), superoxide (O 2−)
   production, activation of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of
   transcription (STAT) and stress signaling pathways including Jun N-terminal kinase
   (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase – . Further
   evidence from our lab as well as others also indicated that leptin deficiency
   paradoxically triggers cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction in
    ob/ob obese mice with a mutant leptin gene, the effect of which
   is reconciled by leptin supplementation . Both hyperleptinemia
   and leptin-deficiency have been shown to be associated with increased apoptosis, DNA
   damage and mortality, suggesting a potential association between leptin signaling
   and aging-related DNA damage and premature death . Nevertheless, the
   interaction between obesity and aging on cardiac function, with a focus on leptin
   signaling, has not been elaborated.
20396382:11	Given the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in
   older adults and the detrimental impact of metabolic syndrome especially obesity on
   life expectancy and comorbidity in the elderly the present study was
   designed to evaluate the influence of aging on basal and leptin-elicited cardiac
   contractile response in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice.
20396382:12	Expression
   and activation of the leptin receptor Ob-R and post-receptor signaling STAT-3,
    O 2− producing enzyme NADPH oxidase
    ( p 47phox subunit) Akt,
   eNOS, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and the stress signaling molecules p38 MAP kinase,
   JNK, extracellular signaling regulated kinase (ERK) and NFκB were also
   examined in young and aging lean C57 and ob/ob leptin deficient
   obese mice.
20396382:13	Twelve- and eighteen-month-old mice were chosen for the aging group
   largely due to the reduced lifespan and high mortality seen after one year of age in
    ob/ob mice . Cardiomyocyte contractile function was also
   examined in the high fat diet-induced and the leptin receptor mutant hyperleptinemic
    db/db obesity models for comparison.
20396382:14	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The major findings of our current study revealed that increased age mimicked
   leptin-deficient ob/ob obesity-induced changes in cardiomyocyte
   contractile function, intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, NADPH
   oxidase expression, O 2− accumulation, Akt/eNOS and
   stress signaling (p38, JNK and NFκB).
20396382:15	Little additive or synergistic actions
   were noted between aging and ob/ob obesity on the above-mentioned
   parameters, with the exception of a rise in intracellular Ca 2+.
20396382:16	Short-term treatment of leptin at physiological levels (0.5 and 1.0 nM) elicited a
   beneficial effect on cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular
    Ca 2+ responses in young but not aging ob/ob 
   mice whereas pharmacological level of leptin (50 nM) compromised cardiomyocyte
   contractile function, intracellular Ca 2+ handling, NADPH oxidase
   expression, O 2− accumulation, Akt/eNOS and stress
   signaling.
20396382:17	The disparity between young and aging mice in physiological leptin
   level-induced mechanical responses was closely mirrored by an accumulation of
    O 2− and expression of NADPH oxidase
    ( p 47phox ), the enzyme responsible
   for O 2− production.
20396382:18	Further scrutiny depicted that
   aging and obesity independently decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and its
   downstream signaling molecule eNOS, stimulated JNK and IκB phosphorylation
   as well as inhibited p38 phosphorylation without overt interactions between the two.
20396382:19	Consistent with its responsiveness to mechanical function,
    O 2− production and
     p 47phox expression,
   physiological levels of leptin effectively restored leptin deficiency-induced
   changes in the phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS, JNK, IκB and p38 in young but
   not aging ob/ob mice.
20396382:20	These data favor a role of post-insulin
   receptor signaling and stress signaling in obesity-associated cardiac mechanical
   defects and O 2− accumulation.
20396382:21	Our data did not favor
   a major role for the leptin receptor (Ob-R), its post-receptor signal STAT-3, ERK or
   AMPK in leptin-elicited beneficial effects in ob/ob obese mice.
20396382:22	Given that leptin (at physiological levels) failed to reconcile aging-induced
   detrimental effects in cardiomyocytes, it appears that aging may produce cardiac
   contractile and intracellular Ca 2+ defects associated with
    O 2− accumulation reminiscent of leptin-deficient
   obesity through a mechanism(s) independent of interrupted leptin signaling.
20396382:23	Development of obesity and its associated complications may be attributed to multiple
   factors including genetic, dietary, environmental and evolutionary components,
   although pinpointing each specific influence has been rather difficult .
20396382:24	Although human obesity is usually accompanied by hyperleptinemia both
   hypo- and hyper-leptinemia have been shown to induce obesity due to interrupted
   leptin signaling and energy expenditure . Sustained obesity
   (diet-induced or genetically predisposed) impairs cardiac contractile function in a
   manner reminiscent of pre-diabetic insulin resistance and full-blown diabetes – indicating a role for
   insulin resistance in obesity-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction.
20396382:25	This is
   supported by our current observation of dephosphorylated Akt and eNOS in young and
   aging ob/ob mice.
20396382:26	In our study, the leptin deficient
    ob/ob mice were euglycemic at both ages, thus excluding
   possible contribution from full-blown diabetes to the cardiac anomalies of the
    ob/ob mice.
20396382:27	Our data revealed a somewhat similar tibial length
   among young and aging C57 or ob/ob mice, excluding the possible
   contribution of disparate growth and development in these mice.
20396382:28	These data are in
   line with the notion that tibial length reached plateau when body growth slowed down
   after postnatal day 70 in mice . Nonetheless, these ob/ob mice
   were hyperinsulinemic, hypertriglyceridemic and glucose intolerant based on our
   earlier studies , indicating the presence of insulin resistance.
20396382:29	More importantly, our DEXA study depicted an age-dependent increase in body fat
   composition in both C57 lean and ob/ob obese mice, favoring aging
   itself as an independent obesogenic factor . Data from our study
   indicated that aging itself produced a cascade of cardiomyocyte mechanical defects
   reminiscent of young ob/ob or db/db as well as
   high fat diet-induced obese mice.
20396382:30	In all three murine obesity models used in our
   study, both aging and obesity independently triggered an elongation in resting cell
   length, depression in peak shortening (PS) amplitude and maximal velocity of
   shortening/relengthening amplitude (± dL/dt), as well as prolongation in
   relengthening duration (TR 90) but not duration of shortening (TPS).
20396382:31	These
   data are consistent with our previous observations from aged or obese mice , .
   Interestingly, there was little interaction between aging and obesity on
   cardiomyocyte contractile parameters with the exception of further depressed PS and
   ± dL/dt in 18-month-old db/db mice.
20396382:32	These data seem to
   favor the notion that aging and obesity may share somewhat similar cellular
   mechanisms en route to cardiomyocyte mechanical dysfunction.
20396382:33	The
   apparent disparity between ob/ob and db/db mice on
   the synergistic effect of aging (18 months) and obesity depicts presence of an overt
   age-related difference between the two leptin mutant murine obesity models.
20396382:34	Thus
   caution should be taken to derive experimental conclusions using various rodent
   obesity models.
20396382:35	Given our further observation that physiological leptin treatment
   failed to reconcile high fat diet- or age-induced detrimental effects in
   cardiomyocytes, the convergence between aging and obesity in cardiac contractile and
   intracellular Ca 2+ defects as well as
    O 2− accumulation likely occurs at a point
   downstream of or independent of leptin signaling.
20396382:36	The Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a greatly elevated mortality in ob/ob mice,
   supporting the hypothesis that obesity may be considered a status of premature aging
    .
20396382:37	It
   is worth mentioning that the 12 or 18 months of age selected for our
   “aging” mice was not as old as other studies have used.
20396382:38	However
   the mortality rate of ob/ob mice after one year of life is much
   higher than other mouse types .
20396382:39	Although limited information is available for
   the precise cause of death for these ob/ob obese mice, it may be
   speculated that obesity-associated tumorigenesis (e.g., colon and skin cancer),
   chronic inflammation, immune deficiency and cardiovascular complications are among
   the leading causes of death in these mice . In our study,
   the young and aging ob/ob mice exhibited significantly greater fat
   composition, heavier body and heart weights compared with the age-matched lean
   control group.
20396382:40	Moreover, the aging ob/ob mice displayed an
   additional increase in body weight compared with the young ob/ob 
   mice.
20396382:41	Considering the comparable cardiomyocyte functional profiles between young and
   aging ob/ob mice, it appears that the extra body weight gain and
   body fat composition in aging ob/ob mice had little effect on
   cardiac dysfunction associated with obesity.
20396382:42	Nonetheless, the additional increase in
   body and fat mass was mirrored by a drop in the rise of intracellular
    Ca 2+ seen with aging.
20396382:43	The greater cardiomyocyte cell length
   in ob/ob mice at both ages was not affected by short-term
   physiological leptin treatment, likely due to the fact that cardiac hypertrophy
   resulting from interrupted leptin signaling in ob/ob mice is a
   chronic process . During the chronic
   cardiac remodeling process with interrupted leptin signaling, the heart transforms
   from compensated to decompensated states accompanied by deteriorated cardiac
   function.
20396382:44	Our study revealed that both aging and obesity impaired intracellular
    Ca 2+ handling shown as delayed intracellular
    Ca 2+ clearance and reduced intracellular
    Ca 2+ rise, consistent with our previous studies , . Unlike
   the observation from cardiomyocyte mechanical assessment, the obesity-induced
   decline in intracellular Ca 2+ release was further accentuated
   with aging, indicating a possible change in myofilament Ca 2+
   sensitivity in the aging ob/ob murine cardiomyocytes.
20396382:45	These
   observations favor the idea that dysregulated intracellular Ca 2+
   regulation may contribute to cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction (prolonged
    TR 90, reduced PS and ± dL/dt) under aging, obesity or
   both.
20396382:46	Our data further revealed that physiological leptin reconciled intracellular
    Ca 2+ mishandling in young but not aging
    ob/ob mice, indicating that intracellular
    Ca 2+ handling may contribute to the beneficial mechanical
   response of leptin in young ob/ob mice.
20396382:47	Our observation of elevated
    O 2- production and upregulated
     p 47phox subunit of NADPH
   oxidase in both aging and obese groups (without interaction between the two)
   suggests a likely role of NADPH oxidase-dependent
    O 2− release in aging and/or obesity-elicited
   cardiomyocyte intracellular Ca 2+ handling and contractile
   dysfunction.
20396382:48	The NADPH oxidase-dependent O 2−
   production and other reactive oxygen species are known to cause cardiomyocyte
   mechanical dysfunction . The fact that
   physiological leptin alleviated obesity-elicited increases in
    O 2− production and
     p 47phox expression in young but
   not aging ob/ob mice favors a role for NADPH oxidase-dependent
    O 2− production in the disparate cardiac response
   of short-term leptin treatment.
20396382:49	Our further observation in Ob-R expression and
   STAT-3 phosphorylation depicted reduced Ob-R expression and STAT-3 phosphorylation
   in both ob/ob age groups.
20396382:50	To our surprise, unlike its effect on
   cardiomyocyte contractile function, intracellular Ca 2+
   homeostasis and O 2− production, leptin treatment
   restored downregulated Ob-R expression and STAT-3 activation in both
    ob/ob age groups without any effect in lean groups.
20396382:51	These data
   indicate that the likely mechanism responsible for the age-dependent disparity of
   cardiac leptin responses may not reside at the levels of the Ob-R or STAT-3.
20396382:52	This
   notion received further support from our observation that the pharmacological
   concentration of leptin (50 nM) promoted Ob-R/STAT-3 signaling while compromising
   cardiomyocyte contractile function, intracellular Ca 2+ handling,
   NADPH oxidase expression, O 2− accumulation, Akt/eNOS
   and stress signaling.
20396382:53	Data from our previous study revealed that pharmacological
   levels of leptin (50 and 100 nM) compromised cardiac contractile function and
   intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis through an ET-1 receptor-/NADPH
   oxidase-dependent accumulation of reactive oxygen species . Our current data
   revealed unchanged Ob-R (long form) expression and reduced STAT-3 activation in
   murine hearts at 12 months of age.
20396382:54	Limited information is available with regards to
   aging-induced changes in Ob-R expression and STAT-3 activation.
20396382:55	The leptin-induced
   STAT-3 phosphorylation was found to be higher along with an upregulated hypothalamic
   expression of the Ob-R at 14 - 18 months of mouse age compared with 2 months of age
    ,
   indicating increased leptin sensitivity with aging in the mouse brain.
20396382:56	However,
   little information is available on the heart with regards to the impact of aging on
   leptin sensitivity.
20396382:57	Our results showed that aging and obesity independently depressed the phosphorylation
   of Akt and eNOS, stimulated JNK and IκB phosphorylation as well as inhibited
   p38 phosphorylation without overt interaction between the two.
20396382:58	Meanwhile, leptin
   supplementation at physiological levels rescued the dampened Akt/eNOS/p38
   phosphorylation in young ob/ob mice, the effect of which was
   obliterated by aging.
20396382:59	These data are consistent with the basal and leptin-elicited
   responses on cardiomyocyte contractile function, intracellular
    Ca 2+ handling, O 2−
   production and NADPH oxidase expression.
20396382:60	Under-activation of the key cardiac
   survival factor Akt and its downstream signaling molecule eNOS has been demonstrated
   in various models of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure , suggesting a crucial
   role of Akt/eNOS in the maintenance of cardiac function.
20396382:61	It is noteworthy that the
   dampened Akt/eNOS phosphorylation observed in our ob/ob mice may
   contribute to enhanced cardiac oxidative stress and compromised cardiac function
   since the Akt-eNOS cascade is known for its role in cardiac survival, glucose uptake
   and maintenance of cardiac contractile function . In our hands, both
   obesity and aging independently decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS
   without any additive effects between the two, consistent with our data on
   mechanical, intracellular Ca 2+ and
    O 2− production.
20396382:62	These observations favor a key
   role for Akt/eNOS signaling in leptin-deficient obesity and age-induced cardiac
   dysfunction.
20396382:63	Our data revealed reduced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in aged and
   obese mice, while leptin effectively restored p38 phosphorylation in young
    ob/ob but not aging mice.
20396382:64	These results favor a beneficial role
   of p38 phosphorylation in the maintenance of cardiomyocyte function, which is
   supported by the previous finding that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase reduces insulin
   sensitivity and glucose uptake in human myotubes .
20396382:65	This is also in line
   with the finding that leptin directly stimulates p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation
    ,
    . JNK
   and NFκB may be turned on by pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids
   in aging and obesity, resulting in interrupted insulin signaling and development of
   cardiac dysfunction . Our observation of enhanced phosphorylation of
   JNK and IκB (which removes its inhibition on NFκB) in aging and
   obesity are consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS.
20396382:66	In
   addition, our results revealed that neither obesity nor age significantly affected
   the total expression and phosphorylation of ERK and AMPK.
20396382:67	Interestingly, combining
   obesity and age significantly attenuated phosphorylation of ERK and AMPK, the
   effects of which were ablated and unaffected, respectively, by leptin treatment.
20396382:68	Although we are unable to offer any precise explanation for the combined effect
   between age and obesity on ERK and AMPK at this time, our data do not favor a
   significant role for ERK and AMPK in the reminiscent cardiac defects between aging
   and obesity as well as the disparity in the leptin cardiac responsiveness.
20396382:69	Further
   study is warranted to better address the interplay among various cell signaling
   pathways such as sirtuin, a key signaling molecule in longevity and lifespan or
   RAGE, which plays a key role in aging-associated cardiomyocyte dysfunction via
   NFκB activation in the aging- and obesity-associated cardiac
   contractile dysfunction.
20396382:70	Experimental limitations: Although our study provided a likely causal relationship
   among cardiac mechanical function, intracellular Ca 2+
   homeostasis, NADPH oxidase, O 2− accumulation,
   Akt/eNOS and stress signaling activation between aging and obesity, caution should
   be taken for the interpretation of the precise interaction between aging and obesity
   in cardiac dysfunction in the human setting.
20396382:71	First and foremost, the short-term
    in vitro leptin incubation used in our study may not best
   represent the in vivo longer term effect of leptin on phenotypic
   changes in obesity.
20396382:72	Oxidative modification of intracellular Ca 2+
   handling proteins is known to contribute to altered cardiomyocyte mechanics such as
   prolonged relaxation in obesity .
20396382:73	It may be speculated that short-term incubation
   of physiological levels of leptin may interrupt the oxidative processes (i.e.
   scavenging reactive oxygen species) thus shifting the redox balance towards reducing
   processes and promoting reactions to temporarily reverse oxidative modification of
    Ca 2+ handling proteins.
20396382:74	Nonetheless, this may not truly
   reflect the physiological setting in vivo . In our study, only male
   mice were used which ignored the important gender disparity in obesity and aging
    . In
   our cell isolation procedure, butanedione monoxime was used to uncouple
   cardiomyocyte contractile elements and maintain cell viability for a prolonged
   period of time, which may unevenly alter the true in vivo 
   cardiomyocyte mechanics and thus bias cardiomyocyte function from lean and
    ob/ob groups.
20396382:75	Measurement of contractile performance in
   isolated cardiomyocytes has been established to provide a fundamental assessment of
   cardiac contractile function in pathological states.
20396382:76	However, as in any study of
   this nature, caution needs to be taken when correlating our present cellular
   findings to whole heart function, as the latter is composed of heterogeneous cell
   types, including nerve terminals and fibroblasts, as well as the connective tissue
   alluded to above.
20396382:77	Furthermore, cardiomyocytes beat at a high frequency in
    vivo as opposed to the non-physiological slow pace (0.5 Hz) used in our
   study despite the fact that a low frequency contraction is deemed as a
   “slow motion” to maximally reveal the cell mechanical defect.
20396382:78	Last but not least, the long–form Ob-Rb receptor monoclonal antibody used
   in our study may cross-act with the short-form leptin receptors although the latter
   cannot turn on the full JAK-STAT leptin signaling due to the absence of the
   essential box-2 motif.
20396382:79	In summary, data from our present study suggested that aging and the leptin deficient
    ob/ob obesity compromise cardiac contractile function and
   intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis via comparable mechanisms
   involving NADPH oxidase-dependent O 2− production,
   phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS as well as the stress signaling molecules p38, JNK and
   NFκB.
20396382:80	Our study further revealed an age-associated disparity in
   physiological leptin level-elicited responsiveness in cardiomyocyte contraction,
   intracellular Ca 2+ handling and
    O 2− production.
20396382:81	Collectively, these data favor a
   role for NADPH oxidase, O 2− generation, Akt, eNOS
   and the stress signaling molecules p38, JNK and NFκB, rather than Ob-R and
   STAT-3, in the basal and leptin-elicited cardiac response during aging and obesity.
20396382:82	Our data further revealed both similarity and disparity in aging-associated
   cardiomyocyte mechanical response between ob/ob obesity and high
   fat diet-induced or the hyperleptinemic db/db obesity.
20396382:83	Given the
   lack of knowledge of aging-induced changes in adiposity and leptin signaling, the
   precise interplay between aging and obesity, and contribution of leptin signaling
   and downstream stress signaling activation, if any, to the cardiac contractile
   dysfunction in the state of concurrent aging and obesity warrant further
   research.
18405366:0	Background 
Joint analysis of DNA orthologues from multiple species conveys important information about sequence properties.
18405366:1	This comparative approach is a powerful concept in genome analysis today.
18405366:2	DNA sequences with unexpected conservation across species have gained particular interest [ - ] as they are likely to encode important and constrained functionality across species.
18405366:3	Throughout the paper the term conserved will refer to primary sequence conservation among multiple species.
18405366:4	There are many types of conservation acting at different constraint levels upon the genome.
18405366:5	Secondary and tertiary structures as well as interactions of non-coding RNA may be preserved with little primary sequence information remaining conserved . 
The problem of measuring the conservation of sequences across multiple species has been addressed in a number of publications, [ - ].
18405366:6	Stojanovic et.
18405366:7	al. compared 5 different methods for scoring the conservation of a multiple sequence alignment in gene regulatory regions . Blanchette et.
18405366:8	al.
18405366:9	developed an exact algorithm, limited to short multiple sequences, for the detection of conserved motifs based on a parsimony approach . Margulies et al. presented two alignment based methods that incorporate phylogenetic information and are suitable for whole genome analysis . Siepel and Haussler presented an approach (phastCons) using a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model (phylo-HMM) allowing for high throughput measurement of evolutionary constraint . Cooper et al. introduced GERP and more recently Asthana et al. presented SCONE which produce per-base scores of conservation and constraint.
18405366:10	PhastCons, GERP and SCONE scores have been used as comparisons in this paper and are briefly reviewed in the Discussion . These methods require the a priori estimation of a neutral evolutionary rate and measure conservation as the "surprise" of observing the analyzed data assuming the neutral model.
18405366:11	Neutral substitution rates are usually estimated from fourfold degenerated sites or ancestral repeats . 
The ENCODE project revealed that about half of the analyzed functional elements found in non-coding DNA had been classified as unconstrained . Pheasant and Mattick , among others, have argued that this could partly be explained by questioning the neutral rate of evolution used by existing sequence conservation studies.
18405366:12	Wrong assumptions about the neutral rate would lead to biased conservation measures and eventually to an over- or underestimate of the fraction of the genome under evolutionary constraint.
18405366:13	For example, ancestral repeats are often assumed to evolve neutrally, but have been previously shown to include a nontrivial amount of constrained DNA . Here, we propose a method that tries to avoid such a priori assumptions.
18405366:14	We suggest that the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of rate heterogeneity is a more direct measure for sequence conservation.
18405366:15	Different estimators for these rates have been presented and reviewed in the literature [ - ].
18405366:16	Here, we obtain the ML estimate of the rate process using an optimized window function.
18405366:17	While this approach does not require assumptions about neutral rates, prior distribution of rates or transition probabilities between rate categories, we show in silico that reliable estimation in the mean squared error (MSE) sense is achieved in regions of conserved sequence.
18405366:18	We present a qualitative comparison of the scores calculated by KuLCons and the established methods phastCons, GERP and SCONE that assume a neutral model.
18405366:19	ENCODE regions were used for comparison.
18405366:20	Furthermore, we present an information theoretic projection of local multiple parameter estimates to a score which allows for richer or more complex parameter models like the consideration of insertion and deletion (InDel) rates.
18405366:21	Results taking gaps in the alignment as InDels into account are presented.
18405366:22	Results 
Discussion 
In Figure we showed a comparison of KuLCons to phastCons, GERP and SCONE.
18405366:23	The methods aim to detect sequence conservation and/or constraint based on different models: phastCons quantizes the rate heterogeneity parameter in two different categories.
18405366:24	One category represents constrained evolution and the other neutral evolution which are modeled as the states of a phylogenetic-Hidden Markov Model (phylo-HMM) each associated with different ψ . PhastCons scores reflect the a posteriori state probabilities of the HMM and thus express the probability of constraint, based on the underlying degree of conservation and the assumptions about neutral evolution imposed on the Hidden-Markov model.
18405366:25	While this is very well suited for high throughput processing, a simplistic binary model on genome evolution is imposed.
18405366:26	The two state HMM implies that evolution is either conserving or neutral.
18405366:27	The model has to be tuned with a priori information such as transition rates among the conserved and the neutral state, which implicitly imposes assumptions about the expected length and coverage of conserved regions.
18405366:28	The result of the binary model can be clearly observed in Figure providing clear indication for strong or weak conservation but lacking sensitivity for different degrees of conservation.
18405366:29	GERP compares observed and expected substitution rates on a phylogenetic tree with fixed topology.
18405366:30	The branch lengths of the observed tree are estimated for each column separately and branch lengths of the expected tree are based on the average of estimates from neutral sites.
18405366:31	The final score is the difference of the observed to the expected substitution rate induced by the corresponding estimated trees . GERP predicts constraint elements using a null model of shuffled alignments.
18405366:32	SCONE scores express the p-value that a position evolved neutrally given a model that accounts for context-dependency, InDel events and neutral evolution.
18405366:33	Hence, the score can as well be interpreted as a probability of constraint . 
Another method used in the ENCODE analysis, BinCons developed by Margulies et al. , was not included in the comparison because it was noted by Siepel  that scores of BinCons and phastCons give qualitatively similar results.
18405366:34	In contrast to the approaches mentioned above, KuLCons considers the direct estimation of the rate heterogeneity θ i ∈ or more parameters from an evolutionary model ψ via Maximum Likelihood using an optimized sliding window.
18405366:35	The Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to project the estimated parameters to a conservation score.
18405366:36	The rate parameter θ is the crucial parameter for detecting evolutionary conservation and the ML sliding window approach in silico can achieve high estimation accuracy assuming a model of gamma distributed rates with autocorrelation.
18405366:37	We believe that KuLCons has the following advantages: 
1.
18405366:38	The presented algorithm is free of assumptions about neutral evolutionary rates that are notoriously hard to determine [ , ].
18405366:39	Furthermore, it uses few a priori parameters that require biological considerations.
18405366:40	We have shown that our ML estimation of substitution rates in an optimized Gauss window without assumptions on the rate prior leads to good performance in the MSE sense.
18405366:41	2.
18405366:42	Our score reflects well the different degrees of conservations and is in accordance with state-of-the-art methods.
18405366:43	This soft score may disclose new possibilities in comparative genome analysis allowing the comparison of different finescale conservation patterns within conserved regions of interest.
18405366:44	3.
18405366:45	It is possible to extend the phylogenetic model as long as a distribution on the columns of the alignment is induced.
18405366:46	A whole set of different process parameters can then be mapped to a conservation score via the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
18405366:47	A score was shown in Figure that uses co-estimated InDel rate parameters.
18405366:48	Another possibility would be to assign different θ to different subtrees thus allowing for lineage-specific rate heterogeneities.
18405366:49	Our results show that the KuLCons score qualitatively exhibits similar conservation patterns in different regions as GERP and SCONE.
18405366:50	This observation has two important consequences: first, it is possible to score the conservation of DNA sequences without having assumptions or estimates on neutral rates.
18405366:51	The estimation and potential bias of these rates have been controversially discussed in the past [ , ].
18405366:52	Secondly however, our results suggest that conserved elements inferred from this method will probably not be very different from those discovered by GERP and SCONE opposed to the conjecture raised in .
18405366:53	This would mean that the discrepancies of experimentally verified functional elements and computationally predicted conserved regions [ , ] cannot be explained in majority by biased assumptions on neutral rates.
18405366:54	One explanation might be that low scoring sequences experience constraints at a different information level (e.g. structure) that is not directly detectable by simple sequence alignments but rather structural alignments.
18405366:55	An alternative explanation is that species specific functional elements that are not conserved across a given set of species are more important in functional evolution than currently discussed.
18405366:56	Conclusion 
We presented and evaluated a novel method for the calculation of sequence conservation scores over multiple sequence alignments.
18405366:57	Opposed to existing methods, we avoid estimates of neutral substitution rates by testing divergence from perfectly conserved columns on the assumption that these represent maximum conservation.
18405366:58	Furthermore our method does not assume a prior distribution on the rate heterogeneity and does not require prior tuning.
18405366:59	Our simulation results suggest that local ML estimation of substitution rates in a sliding Gauss window can achieve a high accuracy in detecting patterns of conservation.
18405366:60	We qualitatively compared our score to the scores of established methods (phastCons, GERP and SCONE) in ENCODE regions and found that our algorithm is well suited for discriminating among different degrees of conservation and reveals good accordance with scores produced by GERP and SCONE.
18405366:61	We find that even though KuLCons differs from GERP and SCONE in several regions it does not seem to indicate surprisingly different conserved elements.
18405366:62	A strong advantage of our approach is that it also allows for multiple parameters to contribute to the conservation score in a probabilistic framework and thus can for example account for insertions and deletions which many other known methods do not.

17932557:0	Introduction 
The history of pharmacy in Britain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was shaped by two main influences, namely the advancement of the pharmaceutical sciences, and the efforts of its practitioners to raise their calling to the rank of a recognized corporate profession.
17932557:1	The work of the chemist and druggist—the future pharmacist—was an unusually responsible employment in that it supplied the community with medicines and drugs, and handled poisonous substances both for domestic and agricultural use.
17932557:2	For the protection of the public it was desirable that chemists and druggists should possess a competent knowledge of their business, as evidenced by a recognized qualification.
17932557:3	Thus the practice of pharmacy was gradually regulated by legislation through successive Acts of Parliament; instances of technical uncertainties or questions of professional conflict often led to decisions being sought in the Courts of Law.
17932557:4	On more than one occasion the chemists and druggists had to defend their territory from threatened or actual incursions, both from above by the apothecaries and medical practitioners, and from below by general dealers and warehousemen.
17932557:5	These interlocking scientific, educational, social and legal aspects have given the history of pharmacy a many-facetted and occasionally somewhat turbulent character, with financial and political overtones possibly more prominent than those prevailing in other scientific disciplines.
17932557:6	The practice of pharmacy was gradually elevated from the rank of an occupation to that of a profession, particularly by the institution of a regulating body, the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and the introduction of qualifying examinations to ensure the professional competence of candidates entering the ranks of its registered members.
17932557:7	The ensuing need for training facilities was met, in the late and immediate post-Victorian era, to a considerable degree by the emergence of private schools of pharmacy, which were specially geared to preparing aspiring pharmacists for their qualifying examination.
17932557:8	Amongst these, the Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy was arguably the most prominent, successful and enduring example.
17932557:9	An examination of its origin and its progress over a period of nearly seventy years (1874–42) provides an interesting insight into a significant aspect of this phase of pharmaceutical education that has previously received little attention.
17932557:10	The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 
A long-standing rivalry had existed between the Apothecaries (incorporated as a City company in 1617, and specially licensed by charter since 1748) and the chemists and druggists, who remained as yet unorganized.
17932557:11	It led to repeated attempts of the former to gain exclusive control of the distribution of medicines to the public.
17932557:12	Thus, when their proposed Parliamentary Bill of 1815 threatened to prohibit the practice of pharmacy to “uncertificated” persons, the chemists and druggists succeeded only narrowly, by concerted protests, to have the fatal clause withdrawn before the Bill was enacted.
17932557:13	Twenty-five years later, the Apothecaries attempted once again to secure a hegemony over the chemists and druggists: they proclaimed (not without truth) that unlike themselves, chemists were not required to pass any public examination, nor hold any approved certificates as dispensers of medicines and suppliers of poisons and dangerous drugs.
17932557:14	They introduced a Bill into Parliament that would, in effect, empower them to oversee the business of a set of competitors whom they regarded as their inferiors.
17932557:15	Once again, the proposals were strenuously opposed by their intended targets, who found support both inside and outside Parliament, eventually preventing the Bill from reaching the Statute Book.
17932557:16	These episodes did not fail to impress on the chemists and druggists the vulnerability of their position, and the urgent need to secure official recognition of their place within the medical hierarchy.
17932557:17	The decisive step in protecting the future independence of the chemists and druggists was the foundation in 1841 of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, largely by the initiative of several leading spirits, foremost amongst them Jacob Bell and William Allen.
17932557:18	Its royal charter (1843) identified the Society’s chief objectives as the advancement of chemistry and pharmacy, the promotion of a uniform system of education for its practitioners, and the legal protection of those who carried on this calling.
17932557:19	In return, the public could expect greater safety and more expert service by dealing with properly qualified professionals.
17932557:20	The young Society pursued these aims vigorously, and consolidated its position by acquiring London premises, laying the foundations of a School of Pharmacy, and by publishing its official periodical, the mark of a reputable scientific or professional institution.
17932557:21	As a result of these exertions, the chemists and druggists had the satisfaction of finding themselves officially listed in the Census of 1861 among the professional class, as “persons who render direct service to mankind”, while manufacturing chemists were still assigned to the industrial class, alongside workers and artisans.
17932557:22	Although the chemists and druggists had been motivated largely by external pressures to rally to the defence of their calling, they were not alone in their concern for their professional status: other professions desired to raise their respectability in the eyes of the public by improved standards of education and competence of their members.
17932557:23	One effectual measure of achieving this was to replace or supplement the traditional admission to their ranks by apprenticeship or pupillage with formal qualifying examinations, preferably in conjunction with approved courses of study.
17932557:24	Thus the Law Society, founded in 1827, began to regulate the training of solicitors by a system of examinations inaugurated in 1836.
17932557:25	The measure had the incidental beneficial effect of guarding the profession against incursions from outsiders, such as unqualified legal advisers, general agents, and accountants, from which it was apt to suffer.
17932557:26	In 1847–8, the Institute of Actuaries and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers were founded as professional organizations and examining bodies.
17932557:27	Even the physicians and surgeons, though members of old-established and respected professions, still lacked a consistent system of recognizable qualifications: this was now introduced and administered by their respective Royal Colleges by a stricter examination regime.
17932557:28	From the mid-century, the number of associations conferring vocational qualifications proliferated, reaching a total of 136 in England and Wales by the 1960s; they earned increasing public respect as guardians of professional competence and conduct.
17932557:29	The foundation year of the Pharmaceutical Society also marked the establishment of the Chemical Society by the practitioners of chemistry as teachers, manufacturers, analysts, and researchers.
17932557:30	Its declared aims were purely academic, being “the general advancement of chemical science by the discussion and publication of new discoveries, and the interchange of information respecting them”, and by the setting up of a library.
17932557:31	The Society imposed no restrictions to applicants for admission beyond a declared interest in chemistry, and the personal recommendation of two (later three) of its Fellows.
17932557:32	It served a vastly smaller and slower-growing membership than its pharmaceutical sister-institution, but future developments were already foreshadowed in the wording of its royal charter (1848) which recognized:
 
With the widening employment of chemists in industry, education and local authorities, a need for a stricter institutionalization of the profession was felt within the Society, but was eventually met by the creation, in 1877, of a separate body, the Institute of Chemistry.
17932557:33	It fostered the general interests of the profession of chemistry, and the protection of the public by ensuring that “chemists were duly qualified for the proper discharge of their duties”.
17932557:34	Accordingly, it acted as an examining body, and its grades of associateship and fellowship (AIC, FIC) were accepted by employers as alternatives to a university degree in chemistry.
17932557:35	The Apprenticeship 
Chemists and druggists had traditionally been admitted to their calling by serving an apprenticeship of up to six years in a chemist's shop.
17932557:36	Although such a route may be adequate for learning an artisan's trade, it was clearly no longer a satisfactory method of entry into a profession that required, in addition to practical competence, a sound knowledge of much specialist information.
17932557:37	Under this old system, the training of the pharmaceutical apprentice was indeed a matter of some chance depending on the good will and competence of the master, and the style and extent of his trade.
17932557:38	It was only in the busier shops of the larger towns that a young beginner had the opportunity of thoroughly learning the art of dispensing and receiving an all-round training.
17932557:39	Neglect and ill-use were not unknown: thus the future eminent chemist Edward Frankland, who served a six-year apprenticeship in a chemist shop in the small provincial market-town of Lancaster, lamented later the “six wasted years of unprofitable labour and servitude” that he had endured.
17932557:40	His master had taught him nothing, and such knowledge as he was able to gather was the result of his own curiosity.
17932557:41	Even under so enlightened a proprietor as William Allen of the highly reputable pharmacy in Plough Court, City of London, the work ethos during the early nineteenth century was uncompromisingly severe.
17932557:42	More cheerful but still sobering experiences were recollected by a pharmacist who had completed his apprenticeship in the 1890s in an obviously superior establishment, which kept four or five apprentices of ascending seniority.
17932557:43	They performed increasingly responsible tasks, from the humble beginner’s duties of tidying the shop and running errands, to the intermediate ranks preparing tinctures, extracts and galenicals, eventually graduating to the dignity of the dispenser’s counter.
17932557:44	Working hours were long, discipline strict, and sober deportment and appearance was insisted on.
17932557:45	The proprietor, who divided his time between the front counter, his account books and business correspondence, did not pretend to attend to the training of his apprentices, who picked up their knowledge by practice, and from one another as best they could.
17932557:46	A critical analysis of the reminiscences of a cross-section of British pharmacists who were active during the first half of the twentieth century confirms the diversity of the quality of their apprentice years, and incidentally gives some first-hand insight into the problems, financial and vocational, faced by the principals in running their business, which necessarily affected the progress and welfare of their apprentices.
17932557:47	Chemist by Examination 
Shortly after its foundation in 1841, the Pharmaceutical Society established a School of Pharmacy at its headquarters at 17 Bloomsbury Square, with a staff of three professors (of pharmacy, chemistry and materia medica) and the provision of some teaching laboratories, for the preparation of candidates for its qualifying examinations.
17932557:48	Passing the “Minor” examination (the title of which belied its comprehensive coverage of chemistry, botany, materia medica, pharmacy and dispensing) entitled the successful entrant to the style of “Chemist and Druggist”, official registration with the Society, and the right to conduct a pharmaceutical business.
17932557:49	The “Major” examination, which aimed at the consolidation of the scientific core subjects, led to the grander title of Pharmaceutical Chemist (PhC).
17932557:50	During the early phase of this teaching project, alternative opportunities of receiving systematic instruction in scientific subjects were meagre.
17932557:51	Such teaching as was available was usually limited to lectures, unsupported by practical work performed by the student.
17932557:52	Science courses, albeit of varying quality, were offered by the recently conceived Mechanical Institutes, and elementary chemistry appeared on the syllabuses of the teaching hospitals of University College and King’s College, London, and the Scottish universities, generally as part of the medical curriculum.
17932557:53	The first serious scheme of systematic instruction in a scientific discipline was realized with the foundation of the Royal College of Chemistry in 1845.
17932557:54	By the active support of the Prince Consort (himself a temporary student of chemistry in his university days), the College secured the services, as its professor and director, of the future eminent German chemist A W Hofmann, then a young man of twenty-seven, who guided its fortunes for the next twenty years.
17932557:55	As a pupil of Justus von Liebig, whose work and teaching was well known and admired in England, he introduced an academic teaching schedule in the image of the famous Giessen school, in which the student was thoroughly grounded in the principles of his science, and in the laboratory practice of chemical analysis.
17932557:56	Dedicated students had the opportunity of taking part in Hofmann’s ongoing researches in organic chemistry.
17932557:57	Between 1845 and 1853 (the year of its amalgamation with the Royal School of Mines) the College had been the training ground of 356 students, including some of the most distinguished future British academic chemists.
17932557:58	The course was informal insofar as it did not lead to a degree or equivalent certification.
17932557:59	It was also flexible, allowing the students the choice to leave early after having acquired a level of competence which they considered adequate for pursuing their future career as analysts, brewers, dyers, metallurgists, or teachers.
17932557:60	A significant proportion (approximately l0 per cent) were pharmacists wishing to deepen their knowledge of chemistry, both for improving their examination prospects, and for enhancing their general proficiency.
17932557:61	The Pharmaceutical Society was anxious to encourage entrants to the profession to gain official recognition by way of its examinations, but the completion of a plain apprenticeship continued to be a sufficient qualification for owning or managing a retail pharmacy.
17932557:62	The situation changed dramatically with the passing of the Pharmacy Act of 1868, which laid down three main principles: the establishment of an official Register of qualified Pharmaceutical Chemists, of Chemists and Druggists, Assistants and Apprentices, and the restriction of such titles to duly registered persons; the necessity of all persons owning or managing a pharmaceutical business to pass the prescribed qualifying examination (those already established in their own shop being temporarily exempted from this requirement); and the conferment of the examining and registering functions on the Pharmaceutical Society.
17932557:63	The Act thus imposed on the rising generation of chemists and druggists a more uniform and stricter training than hitherto, and conferred on the Pharmaceutical Society considerable powers to enforce the measures, albeit under the ultimate supervision of a Committee of the Privy Council.
17932557:64	Henceforth, the passing of the Society’s qualifying examination was the aim of all young persons engaged in pharmacy.
17932557:65	It required careful preparation hardly attainable by unsupervised private study, though occasionally attempted with success by able and determined candidates.
17932557:66	A regular course of instruction was normally essential for a favourable outcome.
17932557:67	The Society's own school, which had opened with a class of forty students in 1843, was, in spite of later expansion, unable to cope with the rising number of would-be students; adequate facilities were even less available in the provinces (except in Edinburgh).
17932557:68	The situation stimulated the emergence of private teaching establishments specializing in preparing students for their pharmaceutical examinations.
17932557:69	Evidence of a real need for such training centres was their steady spread; in the metropolis, the provinces, and Scotland their number increased from two in 1870, to five, seven and twenty-two in 1880, 1890, and 1900, respectively.
17932557:70	Of these, the Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy was by common consent the largest and most successful.
17932557:71	It was founded in 1874 by G S V Wills, who guided its work as Principal for the next fifty years.
17932557:72	Its surviving records and prospectuses, evidently more complete than those of similar establishments, and personal reminiscences concerning its Principal, convey an authentic and vivid picture of the busy life of a thriving private school of pharmacy of the period, and, with it, an impression of the substantial educational contribution of this sector as a whole.
17932557:73	George S V Wills and the Foundation of the Westminster College 
George Sampson Valentine Wills was born on 14 February 1849 in the village of Roade near Stony Stratford in the County of Buckinghamshire.
17932557:74	Here his ancestors had for several generations worked as builders of some local consequence, his great-grandfather Sampson and grandfather George being active as stonemasons, and skilled in the construction of arched bridges and the repair of church buildings.
17932557:75	Young Wills received his early education at the British School in Stony Stratford, and attended the town’s Baptist Chapel and its Sunday school.
17932557:76	It gave him the opportunity to learn to play the organ, and awakened a love of music that remained a source of pleasure throughout his life.
17932557:77	On leaving school, Wills attached himself for a time to a rural eccentric who practised “physic” amongst the country folk; he helped him in the manufacture of his simple remedies, and furthered his own fascination with plant and drug lore by reading as many books on these subjects as were within his reach.
17932557:78	He was presently apprenticed (1866) to a chemist and druggist of the town: the shop changed hands twice in quick succession, but the resident apprentice Wills was each time taken over with the stock.
17932557:79	The second of these masters, Mr Benjamin Bullus, fostered Wills’s progress with benevolent care, and subsequently appointed him assistant in his new venture at Hookley Hill, Birmingham.
17932557:80	Thereafter (from 1870), Wills worked in similar positions at Hay-on-Wye, Barrow-in-Furness, and Folkestone.
17932557:81	Two years' private study while in this full-time employment enabled him to pass the all-important Minor examination of the Pharmaceutical Society.
17932557:82	He next secured the post, out of sixty applicants, of dispenser in the medical practice of C F DuPasquier, Apothecary to the Queen’s Household.
17932557:83	An obstacle arose when it was realized that Wills did not hold the Dispenser’s Certificate of Apothecaries’ Hall, which, though inferior in standard to his pharmacist’s qualification, was in Dr DuPasquier’s eyes, an essential prerequisite for royal service.
17932557:84	Wills was confident of his ability to obtain the diploma without further preparation on his part.
17932557:85	He offered to pass, within the next three days, the necessary examination (which was held weekly at that time).
17932557:86	To DuPasquier’s astonishment, he made good his promise and was duly confirmed in his new post.
17932557:87	Its duties were apparently not onerous, affording a good deal of free time, which Wills soon put to good use.
17932557:88	He remembered the plight of young colleagues he had met in the provinces, who had struggled to study for their qualifying examination but, lacking guidance, had usually failed.
17932557:89	He resolved to help by devising a system of postal instruction that would direct their efforts to better effect.
17932557:90	The enterprise was an instant success; for Wills it was the turning point of his career, showing him the path to his true vocation as a gifted teacher and educationalist.
17932557:91	The success of the postal scheme convinced Wills that there was similar scope for full-time instruction.
17932557:92	It gave him the confidence to resign his post with Dr DuPasquier, and inaugurate in October 1874 the Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy in his house at 133 St George’s Road, Lambeth.
17932557:93	At first, only two rooms were fitted up as laboratories, and the number of pupils was small, but soon one room after another had to be given over to teaching, until Wills was literally turned out of his home, and further accommodation had to be found in a pair of adjacent houses in nearby Lambeth Road.
17932557:94	Continued growth of the College necessitated the transfer of some departments to two large halls in North Street, Kennington Road.
17932557:95	An artist's impression of the chemical laboratory on this site is curiously reminiscent of the well-known print of Liebig's famous laboratory in Giessen, not least by the obvious maturity of many of the students.
17932557:96	Even these enlarged premises soon proved inadequate.
17932557:97	When another move became unavoidable, Wills was fortunate in acquiring in 1882 the distinctive building of a defunct Baptist chapel in Trinity Street, Southwark.
17932557:98	As the more affluent members of its congregation had left the crowded streets of Victorian inner London for the healthier and more pleasant suburbs, attendance at the chapel declined and led to its eventual closure and sale.
17932557:99	In its new function, the nave became the main lecture hall, accommodating 100 students.
17932557:100	The two lateral galleries were levelled, enclosed, and fitted up as a chemical laboratory with seventy-four work-places along one wall, and smaller rooms for practical work along the other.
17932557:101	The Westminster College at Work 
In an establishment geared to meet clear educational targets efficiently and economically, the student was fully occupied all day in attending lectures and laboratory classes.
17932557:102	The lecture hall accommodated the entire student body, but for practical and special subjects, the class was split into five groups who participated in a dovetailed scheme that effected a full rotation twice each term.
17932557:103	The system used the existing accommodation ingeniously to the best advantage and ensured that the students received maximum individual attention.
17932557:104	On three evenings a week, part-time students kept the college open till 9 o’clock.
17932557:105	The toil of dealing with the postal courses (see p. 494) continued behind the scene.
17932557:106	The cordial relations between teacher and student cultivated by the Principal notwithstanding, strict discipline reigned within the college as the essential condition for the student's progress.
17932557:107	He was required to appear punctually in his assigned (numbered) place in the lecture room, the doors of which were firmly closed once a lecture had started.
17932557:108	Casual behaviour was not tolerated and even more severe rules governed life in the laboratory to ensure the safety of the person and the preservation of the apparatus and equipment.
17932557:109	During the average college term of twelve or thirteen weeks, the student of the Minor course attended morning lectures in chemistry (30), botany and plant histology (25), materia medica and pharmacognosy (35), pharmacy (25), dispensing with prescription reading (35) and physics (12).
17932557:110	The afternoons were spent in the laboratory, chiefly in acquiring practice in qualitative (inorganic) and volumetric analysis.
17932557:111	The interruption of these practical labours by the weekly formal Latin class may have afforded a change, but hardly a relaxation.
17932557:112	The syllabus prescribed by the Pharmaceutical Society governed the course content and is reflected in the teaching manuals specially written by Wills for the use of his students.
17932557:113	A great deal of factual information had to be absorbed and committed to memory, but was consolidated by the practical exercises.
17932557:114	Instruction in dispensing included practice in deciphering doctors’ prescriptions.
17932557:115	Weekly tests and end-of-term internal college examinations (at which medals and certificates could be won) ensured that students made regular progress and gained confidence.
17932557:116	Under this regime they were usually ready to attempt the Minor examination after two terms’ full-time work, but an even shorter course was occasionally sufficient for candidates who had had the good fortune to experience productive apprentice years under a competent and sympathetic master.
17932557:117	The Major course, normally extending over two terms, concentrated on a more detailed coverage of organic chemistry, quantitative chemical analysis (with particular emphasis on the requirements of the British pharmacopoeia ), and a more intimate acquaintance with materia medica.
17932557:118	The cost of attending a full-time course was intrinsically moderate, but yet was no doubt beyond the means of many would-be students.
17932557:119	The inclusive charge for the Minor course was, in 1899, 8 guineas per term, reduced to 12 guineas for two terms, payable in advance.
17932557:120	One payment of 15 guineas secured tuition “until qualified”, but the open-endedness of this offer was not specified.
17932557:121	The fee for the Major course was somewhat lower (6 guineas per term).
17932557:122	Students based outside London were offered accommodation with full board for 1 guinea per week in an approved local establishment for sixty resident pupils.
17932557:123	The loss of potential earnings involved in full-time study was a serious deterrent to many candidates; they availed themselves of the College’s evening classes—conducted on three nights per week, at the low cost of 1 guinea for one evening a week per term —or of the postal courses.
17932557:124	The great majority of the students clearly worked hard with a purpose, but there is no doubt that their Principal worked hardest of them all.
17932557:125	During term, he lectured eight times a week to the Minor, and three times to the Major classes, usually exceeding the scheduled one-hour lecture time.
17932557:126	He illustrated his lectures with demonstration experiments, and with large diagrams and charts drawn on rolls of calico wound on rollers, so that successive illustrations were moved into view.
17932557:127	The botanical drawings were the work of Wills’s eldest daughter Georgina, a trained artist and designer.
17932557:128	According to the College records, Wills delivered his 10,000th lecture on 6 October 1909, an event that was noted in the pharmaceutical press and which attracted numerous messages of congratulation from former students.
17932557:129	In his teaching and administrative work, Wills was supported by his Associate, Henry Wootton (who subsequently started his own pharmaceutical school ), by a secretary responsible for the day-to-day management, and by two, sometimes three demonstrators, his son and his future son-in-law, Percival Woodnoth, amongst them; they were qualified pharmacists, who had usually distinguished themselves as medallists of the Pharmaceutical Society.
17932557:130	When in later years, the course for the Assistant Dispenser's Certificate of Apothecaries’ Hall was frequented by a majority of female students, the class was at times supervised by a lady-demonstrator.
17932557:131	Research 
At this period, basic research in pharmacy was hardly a high priority.
17932557:132	Investigations that were carried out in the Pharmaceutical Society’s laboratory were mostly of an applied character, supplying data needed in the revision of successive editions of the British pharmacopoeia (first published in 1864; fourth edition l898), in which the professors of the Society took an active part.
17932557:133	A report of the Pharmaceutical Society's Council (1895) bestowed only faint praise on its own laboratory, referring to its research work with noticeable lack of enthusiasm as “on the whole satisfactory”.
17932557:134	According to a 1903 survey, experimental work was chiefly aimed at establishing approved methods of drug assay, laying down standards of purity, and suggesting improvements in current manufacturing processes.
17932557:135	Operating under tight financial restraints, the private schools were not able to divert resources from their primary training function to even the simplest experimental research.
17932557:136	Even the well set-up Westminster College remained silent on this subject, when some of its more talented students might have benefited by participating in a modest experimental exercise, the outcome of which was not known in advance.
17932557:137	The small technical library set aside for the use of students was “composed of books of reference for the various examinations”, but it did not apparently subscribe to such periodicals as the Pharmaceutical Journal or the Yearbook of Pharmacy which would at least have drawn attention to current advances.
17932557:138	The intensive routine of the course work was occasionally relieved by visits to factories of major chemical or pharmaceutical manufacturers, presumably made possible by the good repute of the College and Wills’s continued personal relationship with former pupils who had advanced to senior industrial positions.
17932557:139	At the British Oxygen Company, for example, students watched the production of liquid oxygen from air by the Linde process, and the annealing and testing of the heavy steel cylinders, used in the storage of compressed gases.
17932557:140	A group of fifty-two students visited the works of Burgoyne, Burbridge & Co at East Ham, where they witnessed the large-scale production of pharmaceuticals.
17932557:141	When Parke, Davis & Co invited the College in 1916 to inspect their factories in Hounslow, women students outnumbered the men for the first time in Westminster’s history.
17932557:142	The parties were invariably led personally by Wills, who thanked the hosts at the conclusion of the visit in a courteous speech for the hospitality—educational and culinary—they had enjoyed.
17932557:143	Periodic weekend excursions to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew gave the students opportunities to study medicinal plants in their natural habitat.
17932557:144	The Success of Westminster College and its Repercussions 
The share of the Westminster College in the contemporary training of pharmacists was indeed impressive.
17932557:145	After only three years' operation it was able to claim that, as the largest school of its kind in London, its students had achieved nearly as many examination passes as all the other schools in England put together.
17932557:146	It achieved this enviable (and envied) record at a time (1870–1900) when half or more of the candidates regularly failed the Minor examination.
17932557:147	In the Session 1876–77, for example, the numbers of successful Westminster entrants were 105 in the Major, Minor, and Modified examinations, 151 in the Preliminary, and 187 in the Apothecaries' Hall's dispensers' examinations.
17932557:148	A significant proportion had achieved this success by the College's postal system.
17932557:149	When in the following year, 14 Major candidates presented themselves before the Board of Examiners, they secured a 100 per cent pass.
17932557:150	Wills was well aware of the students’ essential contribution to this overall success, and never tired of reminding them of their part in the mutual teaching and learning process:
 
By 1900, after twenty-five years’ steady exertion, 4000 chemists and druggists registered by the Pharmaceutical Society (out of a total of 16,000 nationwide) were alumni of Westminster College, more than 800 of them being established in their own businesses.
17932557:151	They were to be found throughout Britain, as well as in far-flung parts of the Commonwealth, where the London qualification was recognized.
17932557:152	Some 300 former students had entered the medical profession, and three opened schools of pharmacy of their own.
17932557:153	The success of the private pharmacy schools was watched by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society with mounting reserve, as more and more students elected to attend the proprietary sector in preference to the schools approved by the Society.
17932557:154	In 1880, the situation was closely analysed by John Attfield, the Society's professor of chemistry.
17932557:155	In his memorandum, he contrasted a sound and systematic pharmaceutical education with the odious practice of the tutorial establishments that aimed at the mere “preparation of their candidates for passing examinations”.
17932557:156	This deplorable “cramming” approach, though admittedly effective and popular with the students, was likely to impart only superficial and transient knowledge.
17932557:157	At the same time, Attfield admitted certain weaknesses in the Society’s examination system, such as the imperfect correlation of the questioning with the material actually taught, as well as the examiners’ difficulty of distinguishing between bona fide and “crammed” candidates.
17932557:158	Attfield therefore advocated that the preparation for the Minor examination should henceforth be a compulsory full-time course of study of at least five months’ duration at an approved teaching establishment.
17932557:159	His proposals commended themselves to senior members of the Society, as a file of 66 supporting letters, reprinted in his pamphlet, testified.
17932557:160	Of these, 25 were signed by Council members, 26 by examiners past and present, and 15 by “other leaders in Pharmacy”, including the Presidents of the Pharmaceutical Societies of Great Britain, and of Ireland, of the Chemists and Druggists’ Trade Association, and of the Chemists’ Assistants’ Association.
17932557:161	It was further insinuated that the new measures would favour entrants able to afford the cost of full-time study, thus leading to the recruitment of a greater proportion of candidates “from a superior class”, ultimately raising the future standing of the profession, an illiberal attitude that greatly raised Wills’s indignation.
17932557:162	It seems curious that Attfield and his supporters did not attempt to resolve their problem by simply reforming the examinations, which since their inception had been conducted orally by a panel of practising chemists of undoubted seniority but unspecified pedagogical credentials.
17932557:163	A change to written papers would have replaced these often inadequate and unpredictable “interrogations” with a sounder, more academic procedure, allowing candidates to display their knowledge in an orderly and correct style that was so earnestly desired.
17932557:164	Written qualifying examinations were not introduced until the 1920s.
17932557:165	When the Society submitted its proposals to Parliament as a Pharmacy Act Amendment Bill (1891), having previously several times failed to carry the point, Wills resolutely opposed it, both in its educational and social implications.
17932557:166	In a closely argued memorandum addressed to Members of Parliament, who would be the ultimate arbiters, he showed how the proposed obligatory full-time study would close the profession to worthy young men unable to meet the increased expense.
17932557:167	He insisted that it should matter little how and where a candidate had obtained his knowledge, provided he was duly qualified by having passed the prescribed examinations.
17932557:168	He cited the current practice of the University of London, which conferred external degrees (including doctorates) solely on the basis of examination without reference to the student’s scholastic record.
17932557:169	As far as the charge of “cramming” was concerned, Wills had never ceased from urging his students to pursue their studies intelligently, with the desire of acquiring a sound and lasting knowledge as the equipment for a useful professional life.
17932557:170	With help from other liberal influences, the Bill was eventually lost.
17932557:171	Its intended changes were indeed implemented some thirty years later, but by then the greatly changed social conditions made their adoption acceptable.
17932557:172	By his general, liberal attitude and the spirited defence of his teaching methods, Wills did not endear himself to the inner circle of the Society.
17932557:173	When he sought election to its Council, his candidature was actively opposed from that quarter: he failed to win a seat on at least four occasions between 1874 and 1913.
17932557:174	In the 1888 election, for example, when he canvassed the voters by a circular letter briefly setting out desirable policies, a caucus of four very senior members (the powerful names of William Martindale and of F Baden Benger amongst them), issued a counter-circular opposing his election in the most uncompromising terms.
17932557:175	They contended that as a Councillor, he would have a voice in the appointment of the examiners, which for a “proprietor of an educational establishment conducted as a business” would be inappropriate, and hinted at other though unspecified ulterior motives.
17932557:176	In his defeats, Wills was consoled by numerous messages of support from his wide circle of friends amongst the general membership.
17932557:177	The College’s Move to Clapham 
With the passage of the years, the Westminster College continued to enjoy ever-increasing success and popularity.
17932557:178	However, in 1908, financial disaster overtook its Principal which, though unrelated to College affairs, caused a temporary setback to its fortunes.
17932557:179	Wills had, at the commitment of considerable capital, established a pharmacy business (1898) near his residence in South Croydon.
17932557:180	Considering his heavy College duties, it is hardly conceivable that he contemplated conducting the business personally, but may have sponsored it for the benefit of a relative.
17932557:181	Be this as it may, the venture was not a success and led to grave financial embarrassment.
17932557:182	It resulted in the loss of Wills's house and personal assets, and necessitated the voluntary liquidation of Westminster College (which had been registered as a limited company in 1901), and its removal from the much-loved Trinity Street home.
17932557:183	The disruption of College life during a few dark months was swiftly overcome.
17932557:184	With customary energy Wills resumed its established programme at a new location in Clapham Road, Lambeth, a neighbourhood that was the venue of several pharmacy schools.
17932557:185	With the arrival of Westminster College, this area of south London housed six institutions, which between them supplied the greater part of the privately trained pharmacists for the entire country.
17932557:186	In the new location, teaching and laboratory work went on apace as before, evening classes were resumed and postal tuition expanded.
17932557:187	The propinquity of the several pharmaceutical colleges to each other fostered their corporate spirit.
17932557:188	A regular feature at Westminster College was the annual distribution of its prizes and certificates, which was combined with a musical evening or “smoking concert”.
17932557:189	The friendly, neighbourly relations between the Clapham establishments were reflected in joint social events.
17932557:190	A dance held for three of the colleges in 1924, attended by some 200 students and their friends, was apparently the first time that ladies had been invited to a social event, a welcome contrast from the “separate classrooms and museum for women students” that had been advertised five years previously by the London College.
17932557:191	Westminster Correspondence Courses 
A most important activity of the College was its provision of correspondence courses which greatly increased its educational influence.
17932557:192	The capacity of its premises for full-time students never exceeded approximately 150 persons.
17932557:193	However, after only three years’ operation it had currently “the names of 803 pupils on its books, and new ones were added daily”, showing clearly the heavy share of its part-time teaching and correspondence work.
17932557:194	“Wills’ Universal Postal System”, as its author styled his scheme, differed from the conventional practice of sending out lessons together with set work to be attempted and returned to the tutor for correction and comment.
17932557:195	Wills’s scheme merely directed the home study of his correspondents, who were required to monitor their progress by self-assessment.
17932557:196	Being unfamiliar with the exact requirements of the examination syllabus, their chief need was guidance of their efforts into the right channels, a need which the scheme satisfied admirably.
17932557:197	Thus, Wills’s subscriber received regular “lectures” in the form of a printed eight-page octavo pamphlet on one or other subject of the curriculum.
17932557:198	The instalment was usually equivalent to a chapter of a conventional textbook, but was suitably condensed and edited to highlight its most salient points.
17932557:199	The student was instructed to copy these lessons verbatim into a notebook, and thoroughly study, mark and digest the information.
17932557:200	The printed pamphlet remained the property of the College and had to be returned by post before the next one was supplied.
17932557:201	The College insisted on strict regularity of this routine: if the current lesson was not punctually returned, the student was fined (“6 stamps”, presumably to the value of sixpence) and warned, “that he would miss the next instalment which could then only be supplied at the end of the course”.
17932557:202	In its austere simplicity, the Westminster postal scheme embodied advantages for College and student alike.
17932557:203	Once the system was set up, it needed—apart from occasional up-dating—only care and accuracy of clerical staff for its maintenance.
17932557:204	There was no upper limit to the number of students that could be accepted.
17932557:205	The service could therefore be provided at an astonishingly low fee, a full course of 100 lessons sent in 50 instalments costing no more than one guinea.
17932557:206	With the added trifling expense for postage spread over a year or more, access to Westminster postal tuition was indeed available to all.
17932557:207	The benefits to the student were equally obvious: he could commence the course at any time, and progress at a rate suitable to his circumstances.
17932557:208	To the young apprentice or assistant remote from educational centres, the postal courses were a life-line indeed, which greatly raised his prospects of examination success.
17932557:209	Such was the high reputation of this form of tuition that students frequently availed themselves of it before undergoing full-time study, which enabled them to reduce the time and expense of later College attendance.
17932557:210	The content of the postal courses, closely tuned to the official syllabus, is reflected in the number of lectures allotted to the individual subjects.
17932557:211	The revision tests—papers issued at regular intervals—were a particularly useful feature; students received more than 500 specimen questions, providing much material for practice, and an insight into the prevailing examination culture.
17932557:212	For all the success of the postal system, Wills was aware of the desirability of imparting a finishing “gloss” on his examination entrants; he strongly advised them to attend College on a full-time basis for at least one month, for final intensive revision and perfection of their skill in chemical analysis and in the identification of materia medica.
17932557:213	Additional help was at hand by the loan, for a fee of 2 guineas, of further teaching aids and specimens, chiefly concerned with the practical part of the work.
17932557:214	The candidate was once again urged to master the contents of Wills’s teaching manuals (see Appendix), with a hint that they provided all the necessary information without distracting him with superfluous matter, as the larger textbooks were liable to do.
17932557:215	The College also ran a popular postal course for candidates of the Preliminary examination of the Pharmaceutical Society, which served as the threshold to its professional examinations.
17932557:216	This was a lower version of common university entrance, being confined to only three subjects, namely arithmetic, English and Latin.
17932557:217	In terms of student passes, the course was apparently highly successful, but its intrinsic educational merit was not high.
17932557:218	However, its manifest dreariness, especially in grammar and Latin, can hardly be blamed on the College, which covered the prescribed syllabus by the pedestrian approach in common use by all but the more enlightened schoolmasters of the day.
17932557:219	The tutorial activities of the Westminster College were part of a much wider educational network that prepared candidates for a variety of qualifying professional examinations.
17932557:220	Postal tuition was particularly appropriate in subjects that required no provision of practical laboratory or workshop instruction, such as the law, accountancy or business studies.
17932557:221	The firm of law tutors, Messrs Gibson & Weldon, for example, had since the 1880s prepared entrants to the Law Society’s examination with conspicuous success, both in tutorial classes and by correspondence courses.
17932557:222	Its Monthly Law Notes for Students presented legal topics instructive for pupils, and provided specimen answers to current examination papers (the latter policy being one which the Pharmaceutical Society disfavoured).
17932557:223	The fee for a three months’ intensive course was 15 guineas, that for the parallel weekly postal course, 6 guineas.
17932557:224	Such was the high regard in which this commercial tutorial firm was held in the profession that it was acquired, in 1962, by the Law Society and amalgamated with its own long-established school to form its new College of Law, now one of the leading law schools of the country.
17932557:225	The Closing Years 
With his extraordinary dedication, Wills remained in sole charge of his College up to the age of seventy-six.
17932557:226	H P Woodnoth, MPS, who had for some years been a member of the teaching staff, and had become Wills’s son-in-law, was taken into partnership in 1914, but did not take up his duties as Joint-Principal until after his return from war service in 1919.
17932557:227	Wills continued in sole command, organized yet another move of the College (from 402 to 190 Clapham Road in December 1916), and bore the main burden of the lecturing load.
17932557:228	He did not fully retire until 1927, when Woodnoth continued to guide the fortunes of the College for another fifteen years.
17932557:229	After the turn of the century an increasing share of pharmaceutical teaching passed to the public sector.
17932557:230	The opening of new polytechnics and technical colleges, especially since the passing of the Technical Instruction Act of 1889, created new departments dedicated to the teaching of pharmacy.
17932557:231	By 1899, approved courses were available in fifteen of the new technical schools, both in London (for example, at Chelsea Polytechnic from 1895) and the provinces.
17932557:232	This expansion, though significant, was tested to the limit of its capacity at the close of the First World War.
17932557:233	The return of demobilized servicemen, whose careers in pharmacy had been interrupted or postponed, created an unprecedented demand for training, leading to a sudden surge of some 4000 applicants for 500 available study places.
17932557:234	The Pharmaceutical Society met the situation by accrediting yet more teaching centres, encouraging the enlargement of existing ones, and the setting up of temporary laboratories.
17932557:235	The qualifying examination was reformed by the replacement of oral questioning by written papers, and by its division into two stages: Part I covered the basic sciences of chemistry, botany and physics, and Part II the professional components, including pharmacy, pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacognosy, and forensic pharmacy.
17932557:236	Once begun, the trend for expansion continued apace.
17932557:237	By 1932, the Society’s official list of recognized institutions had grown to seven centres in London, forty-three in the provinces, and six in Scotland.
17932557:238	Henceforth, students were able to attend college nearer home; they often benefited by studying the basic sciences (especially chemistry) in the competent specialist departments maintained in the larger institutions.
17932557:239	During the acute post-war shortage of training accommodation, the private pharmaceutical schools—the Westminster College foremost amongst them—had valiantly helped to fill the gap, and had indeed temporarily enjoyed increased prosperity and unaccustomed official approbation.
17932557:240	However, the subsequent mounting competition from the public institutions militated powerfully against all but the most robust private schools, and their number declined as the demands in staffing and equipment for teaching an ever-expanding syllabus began to outstrip their resources.
17932557:241	After 1932, the Pharmaceutical Society embarked on a deliberate programme aimed at closing the remaining survivors.
17932557:242	Several provincial establishments were absorbed by local technical colleges (Bath, and Liverpool, for example) or universities (Manchester, Leeds).
17932557:243	In London, the South of England College was acquired by purchase and closed down, and the London College ceased to exist when its Principal was appointed Secretary to the Society’s Standing Committee.
17932557:244	The Westminster College, as one of the longest lasting survivors, advertised its courses as late as the 1930s and was still prominently featured in 1935 in a report and full-page pictorial display in the Chemist and Druggist showing “where Pharmacy is Taught”; two of the nine illustrations depicted its lecture room, and new physics laboratory.
17932557:245	At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the threat of air-attacks on London induced the College to discontinue its day classes in favour of correspondence courses, but this work was not destined to continue for long.
17932557:246	The College address, 190 Clapham Road, regularly listed in the Post Office Directory, disappeared in 1942, which must be taken as the year of its demise.
17932557:247	George S V Wills 
It has been well stated that the success of the individual private schools of pharmacy depended ultimately on the abilities and personality of their principals, a proposition that could hardly be more apposite than in the case of George Wills.
17932557:248	His talents as a teacher and administrator, coupled with a seemingly inexhaustible capacity for work, enabled him to superintend the complex enterprise he had created as a young man with apparent ease that did not diminish with the advancing years.
17932557:249	Wills was a gifted speaker who could, at a moment’s notice, propose a graceful vote of thanks, deliver an amusing after-dinner speech, or take part effectively in a debate.
17932557:250	He had the happy facility of enlivening apparently abstruse topics with anecdote or apt quotation that was appreciated by lay audiences no less than by his Westminster students.
17932557:251	A former pupil of the last class that had been personally supervised by Wills testified to the “magnetism of his personality and the brilliance of his performance” as a lecturer, at a time when he had passed the age of seventy-five.
17932557:252	Wills was the author of some two dozen textbooks and manuals that covered the full range of the pharmaceutical syllabus (see Appendix).
17932557:253	They appeared originally in quick succession under the imprint of Westminster College to aid his own students, but attracting favourable reviews, enjoyed wide circulation.
17932557:254	All these manuals were moderately priced so as to be within the reach of all students.
17932557:255	As a competent analyst, Wills was able to offer his services for the chemical and microscopical examination of water, foodstuffs and drugs, as well as manures, soils, minerals and ores.
17932557:256	During a typhus epidemic in Stony Stratford, the scene of his youth, he traced its cause to the gross contamination of its water supply, with the exception of one spring some distance from the town.
17932557:257	With this information, the community avoided further infection, and installed, on Wills’s advice, a simple water purification plant that prevented future water-borne disease.
17932557:258	When Wills revisited on this occasion his small home town, and delivered a popular lecture ‘On Water’, the local people, proud of their son’s success in the big city, flocked from far and wide to hear him speak.
17932557:259	It is evident that Wills loved a challenge, and when embarked on a contest liked to be on the winning side.
17932557:260	He delighted, through the success of his students, to hold his own before the formidable Board of Examiners year after year, and was no less bold in unfamiliar fields.
17932557:261	An extraordinary feat was his winning an open competition set by a popular magazine, which offered a prize of £5 for the closest estimate of the number of persons walking over London Bridge during twenty-four hours on 23 January 1889.
17932557:262	Of the 36,000 entries received, Wills's figure, 111,870, coincided almost miraculously with the one (111,873) returned by the official team of “enumerators” who had been posted in relays on the bridge throughout the twenty-four hours.
17932557:263	When general disbelief at the marvel was voiced, Wills disclosed his simple statistical method: he had counted 15-minute samples at various times, and calculated his figure directly from these data.
17932557:264	He showed his competitive spirit in other ways: although personally indifferent to sport and athletics, he participated on the spur of the moment at one of the College’s friendly sporting events in the race for veterans, which he promptly won.
17932557:265	As ex officio President of the College’s Football and Cricket Clubs, he paid half the fee of the hire of the ground for the football fixtures, but characteristically met the full cost if his Westminster team won the game.
17932557:266	Not surprisingly, the students held their popular Principal and champion in high regard and affection.
17932557:267	They regularly celebrated his birthday on St Valentine’s Day by a social event, at which they presented him with an illuminated address and occasional present such as Watt’s Dictionary of Chemistry or a silver coffee pot, subscribed from their meagre allowance, as clear tokens of their loyalty.
17932557:268	These sentiments endured long after the students had left the College, and had settled in business or responsible positions in all parts of the kingdom and far away places of the then British overseas territories.
17932557:269	When in 1922, Wills accompanied by his wife and married daughter spent a holiday in South Africa (which included an adventurous overland trip of some 300 miles by motor car from Johannesburg to the port of Durban), he was welcomed there by several of his former students, who were delighted to extend to their teacher and his party every assistance and hospitality.
17932557:270	Wills was a man of firm religious conviction.
17932557:271	In his early Lambeth days, he was a prominent member of the local Baptist Upton Chapel, where he was elected (1881) Vice-President of its Tract Society and a deacon (1885).
17932557:272	He formed a lasting friendship with its minister, the Rev.
17932557:273	William Williams, himself an author and particular friend of the renowned preacher C H Spurgeon.
17932557:274	After his move to South Croydon (1888), Wills felt the want of a religious focus for the local Baptist community, and helped to establish a chapel in their locality, personally acquiring the freehold of the land on which it was eventually built.
17932557:275	Wills’s long life was blessed with a happy marriage, the golden anniversary of which he celebrated on 30 September 1924 in the circle of his family, including his five adult children.
17932557:276	It nearly coincided with the fiftieth jubilee of the opening of the College in early October 1874.
17932557:277	Except for his South Croydon period (1888–1906), Wills lived with his family in inner London boroughs south of the river, moving house several times, but invariably remaining within easy reach of his College.
17932557:278	He died at 5 Lessor Avenue, Clapham Park on 28 April 1932 in his eighty-fourth year and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.
17932557:279	Conclusion 
The present account of the history of the Westminster College of Pharmacy leaves no doubt that in its time—together with its sister institutions—it made a substantial and honourable contribution to pharmaceutical education in Britain.
17932557:280	As the leading institution of its kind in London, its record illustrates most completely the role of private establishments that helped to provide the qualified pharmaceutical personnel that the nation required.
17932557:281	In retrospect, even the Pharmaceutical Society, which had been no friend of the private colleges, commended their efforts, admitting that they had “served their craft in their time faithfully, and many generations of pharmacists were their debtors”.
17932557:282	Wills’s Westminster College was singled out by name as their largest and most productive representative.
17932557:283	Since Wills’s days, both the study and practice of pharmacy have undergone profound changes.
17932557:284	The qualifying course became ever more demanding and university-orientated, as scientific progress refined the traditional subjects, and as raised academic requirements added new ones (including physiology, pharmacology and biochemistry) to the syllabus.
17932557:285	Glasgow was the first to introduce a BSc (Pharm) degree recognized by the Pharmaceutical Society (1919); London followed in 1924 with a two-year General BPharm degree, conferred in the Faculty of Medicine, and extended in 1946 to a three-year Honours degree.
17932557:286	As other British universities followed suit, the curriculum gradually crystallized around the four principal disciplines of pharmaceutics, pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacology, supported by several subsidiary subjects.
17932557:287	In 1967, when the holding of a pharmacy degree was made an essential condition for professional registration, the Pharmaceutical Society discontinued its examining function, but retained its power of approving degree courses, and of imposing additional prescribed vocational experience prior to registration.
17932557:288	A four-year Master’s qualification (MPharm, conferred as a first degree) has recently made its appearance.
17932557:289	The future of the teaching of pharmacy continues to be of close concern to the profession, and remains a subject of serious debate.
17932557:290	During this period of educational reform, the functions of the graduate pharmacist have changed significantly in emphasis and direction.
17932557:291	The art of compounding and dispensing medicines, and the expertise on traditional materia medica—the long-established hallmark of the proficient pharmacist—lost much of their relevance as up-to-date clinical practice has come to rely increasingly on the use of modern synthetic drugs of specific activity and application.
17932557:292	Being provided by the manufacturers in a pre-packed form ready for immediate dispensing, be it as tablets, capsules, etc., they require no further skilled preparative intervention on the part of the pharmacist other than the responsible supervision of their correct supply.
17932557:293	Although the professional scope of the local pharmacist has in this sense narrowed, each of the estimated 30,000 community outlets in Britain requires the presence of at least one registered member of the profession, who is responsible for its conduct under the law.
17932557:294	Thus, the retail distribution of medicines continues to employ the largest fraction of the qualified profession, though largely in a managerial rather than proprietary capacity.
17932557:295	Professional opportunities have widened elsewhere.
17932557:296	Increasing numbers of pharmacists are finding careers in hospital dispensaries.
17932557:297	Between 1953 and 1985, the number of persons so employed in Britain rose from l500 to 4000 (from 7 per cent to 16 per cent of all working pharmacists).
17932557:298	Recent years have also witnessed the emergence of the clinical pharmacist as a senior member of the modern professional health team.
17932557:299	Attached to a hospital, or in a visiting capacity to medical community practices, he or she plays an advisory and consulting role, providing specialist information and guidance on all questions concerning the effectiveness, choice, safety, storage and disposal of drugs and surgical materials.
17932557:300	Such expert support has become increasingly desirable in the appraisal and surveillance of the new remedies constantly generated by current research.
17932557:301	Rewarding careers have also become available in the pharmaceutical industry, whose powerful multinational corporations maintain, with prodigious financial investment, the momentum of contemporary drug discovery.
17932557:302	Its massive research and development programmes require the services of qualified specialists of every branch of the chemical, biological and medical sciences.
17932557:303	With their many-sided training, pharmacists are well placed to contribute to any particular aspect of these research efforts.
17932557:304	Brief reference must finally be made to the independent, privately owned pharmacies’ diminishing share of trade as a result of aggressive competition by the multiple firms whose numerous retail outlets cover the country.
17932557:305	Their centralized manufacturing facilities, their large-scale purchasing power and sheer financial strength have enabled them to set up branches in any prominent locality, and offer the public pharmaceutical services and a greater choice of products at lower prices than the independent pharmacy could hope to match.
17932557:306	Attempts by the Pharmaceutical Society to curb such monopolies, and to prohibit the sale of medical products by customers’ unsupervised self-service—a practice that had started in 1952—by appeals to the courts of law, all ended in expensive failure.
17932557:307	Developments such as these contributed to the tendency of the majority of community pharmacists working as employees or managers rather than their own masters.
17932557:308	The metamorphosis of the chemist and druggist’s apprentice to the university-educated pharmacist-scientist over the span of more than a century has raised pharmacy to a level amongst the professions with which Jacob Bell and his co-founders of the Pharmaceutical Society—its title dignified in 1988 by the “Royal” prefix—would have been well satisfied.
17932557:309	The private schools of pharmacy, as represented by Westminster College under the inspired leadership of its Principal George S V Wills, played their own role in this evolution, and their merits deserve due recognition and a permanent place in the annals of pharmacy.
21126363:0	Background 
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8) is considered a necessary but insufficient cause of Kaposi sarcoma (KS).
21126363:1	Without overt immunosuppression such as AIDS or allogeneic transplant, the annual incidence rate of classic KS (cKS) after age 50 is only about 6.2/100,000 and 2.5/100,000 for KSHV-seropositive men and women, respectively . Non-smoking, diabetes, and use of corticosteroid medications have 2- to 4-fold effects on the risk of cKS , but additional cofactors remain to be identified.
21126363:2	Because it has unusual clinical and geographic features, at least four categories of environmental cofactors for KS have been proposed.
21126363:3	Noting similarities to podoconiosis, Ziegler postulated that KS may result from volcanic soil chronically embedded in the skin . Mbulaiteye suggested that KS may result from enhancement of T-helper type 2 immunity due to chronic schistosome or other parasite infections . Coluzzi thought that KS may result from alterations of cellular immunity induced by biting flies . Lastly, Whitby postulated that KS may result from increased KSHV lytic replication induced by contact with phorbol esters or other constituents of plants . 
We conducted a population-based study of cKS in Sicily, where KSHV seroprevalence is approximately 10% . In addition to non-smoking, diabetes, and use of corticosteroid medications, cKS risk was independently increased 2.7-fold with residential exposure to chromic luvisol . Soils are only one component of a complex ecology that includes insects, microbial organisms, and plants.
21126363:4	Herein, we began to dissect these issues by investigating whether cKS or KSHV serostatus among controls was related to residential exposure to various soils or to direct contact with plants that have postulated biologic effects.
21126363:5	Results 
The analysis was restricted to 962 subjects: 122 cases, 752 KSHV seronegative controls, and 88 KSHV seropositive controls with childhood residence in a Sicilian community and with complete data on contact with all 20 plants.
21126363:6	From the parent study of 1374 subjects, the 412 excluded subjects included 48 with childhood residence outside Sicily, 299 with incomplete plant data, 3 with incomplete cortisone data, 59 controls with indeterminate KSHV serostatus, and 3 with residence in a community that lacked soil data.
21126363:7	Table presents the core model with the distributions for sex and age group (the matching variables) and three cofactors for the 962 included subjects.
21126363:8	The associations of cKS with non-smoking ( P trend = 0.05), cortisone use and diabetes were similar to those reported previously . Cumulative work with plants or soils (none, ≤900 weeks, >900 weeks) was not associated with cKS ( P trend = 0.81) and thus not retained in the core model.
21126363:9	Discussion 
Our primary objective was to determine whether exposures to plants or soils were associated with cKS.
21126363:10	Neither cumulative nor categorical contacts with plants were related to cKS.
21126363:11	Cases with cKS did report more contacts with three individual plants, and they were more likely to have residential exposure to eutric regosol and chromic/pellic vertisol.
21126363:12	For our secondary objective, we found that KSHV seroprevalence among controls was modestly lower with overall exposure to plants (Table ).
21126363:13	This contrasts with our previous observation of higher KSHV seroprevalence with occupational or recreational exposure to plants or soil . Because the earlier seroprevalence analysis was adjusted only for sex and age group, we examined whether the discrepancy might relate to adjusting for diabetes, which was strongly associated with KSHV seronegativity (Table ).
21126363:14	No confounding by diabetes was found.
21126363:15	Specifically, exclusion of diabetes from the regression models yielded associations with seronegativity that were almost identical to those presented in Tables and .
21126363:16	One soil (rendzina) and one plant ( Taraxacum officinale ) had mirror-image associations with KSHV seroprevalence and cKS risk, which probably appeared by chance.
21126363:17	No plant or soil was associated with high seroprevalence and high cKS risk, or with low seroprevalence and low cKS risk.
21126363:18	Conclusions 
The risk of cKS, compared to KSHV seropositive controls, differed with reported contacts with a few plants and with residential exposure to certain soils.
21126363:19	These associations could have arisen by chance due to the multiple comparisons that we performed.
21126363:20	Reassuringly, most of these plants and soils were not associated with KSHV serostatus.
21126363:21	Future studies might focus on how contacts with farm animals, pesticides and parasites, as well as soils and plants such as durum wheat, affect KSHV viremia, which is strongly associated with risk for KS incidence and progression [ - ].
21126363:22	Associations of cKS and KSHV viremia with human genetic polymorphisms, most of which have not been consistently replicated,[ - ] should also be considered.
21126363:23	Understanding these environmental and host interactions will lead to novel insights and means to prevent KS and other herpesvirus-associated malignancies.

18616278:0	Introduction 
A major clinical obstacle in cancer therapy is the development of resistance to a multitude of chemotherapeutic agents, a phenomenon termed multidrug resistance (MDR).
18616278:1	The development of drug resistance in a small subset of tumor cells is believed to be the cause for tumor survival despite invasive chemotherapy.
18616278:2	Chemoresistance can generally result from either of two means: (1) by physically impairing delivery to the tumor (e.g., poor absorption, increased metabolism/excretion, and/or poor diffusion of drugs into the tumor mass) or (2) through intracellular mechanisms that raise the threshold for cell death.
18616278:3	– The latter is commonly implicated in the development of MDR, and, often, more than one mechanism, either simultaneous or sequential, may be responsible for the MDR phenotype.
18616278:4	The most frequently occurring causes of MDR include overexpression of membrane-bound ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps from the ABC transporter family (most notably P-glycoprotein/ MDR-1 ), modifications in drug metabolism through glutathione- S -transferase or cytochrome P450 activity, alterations in DNA repair mechanisms, and critical alterations in the cellular apoptotic signaling mechanisms.
18616278:5	,,
For this purpose, we have hypothesized that a multifunctional nanoparticle-based therapeutic strategy would be beneficial for the treatment of MDR tumor, especially with the use of combination strategies that evade efflux transport and lower the tumor apoptotic threshold.
18616278:6	Based on the principle that MDR has been shown to result from metabolism of the apoptotic mediator ceramide by the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) to elevate the apoptotic threshold, – this novel therapeutic strategy aims to restore the alternation in the cellular apoptotic signaling through a combination therapy of paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule stabilizing agent and promoter of apoptosis, and exogenous C 6-ceramide (CER), which can propagate apoptotic signaling and allow for enhanced cell-kill response.
18616278:7	Based on preliminary evidence, it was found that a combination therapy of PTX with CER is most effective against MDR breast and ovarian cancer when CER is administered with a time delay (typically 6 h) following PTX administration.
18616278:8	To incorporate this temporal spacing of drug release, a polymer-blend nanoparticle was designed by blending 70% by weight poly( d, l-lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) to 30% by weight poly(beta-amino ester) (PbAE) to control release of the PTX + CER combination therapy for optimal therapeutic efficacy.
18616278:9	This strategy was conceived based on earlier work of Little et al., where PLGA/PbAE blend microspheres were used for DNA vaccine delivery in antigen presenting cells.
18616278:10	A large library (>5,000) of poly(beta-amino esters) (PbAEs) has been synthesized and evaluated for cellular toxicity and transfection potential, by reacting diol-diacrylates with various types of primary and secondary amines.
18616278:11	A representative hydrophobic PbAE, synthesized by the addition reaction of 4,4′-trimethyldipiperidine with 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, has unique pH-solubility properties; the polymer remains intact at pH 7.4, but rapidly dissolves at pH 6.5.
18616278:12	This PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticle was designed to immediately release PTX by rapid dissolution of PbAE in a lower pH environment, such as the tumor microenvironment (pH < 6.5), or in the endosome/lysosome of a cell following internalization.
18616278:13	Conversely, CER was expected to exhibit slower release (being localized with the pH-insensitive polymer, PLGA), facilitating cellular apoptosis.
18616278:14	From previous studies, we have observed that the exogenously administered CER reinstates the apoptotic signal to resensitize the cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic drug PTX.
18616278:15	Additionally, long-circulating, nanoparticle-based, systemic delivery of the combination therapy enhances efficacy at the cellular level by increasing intracellular drug accumulation and optimizing the dose administered, and on a whole body level by increasing targeting and residence time of the drug at the tumor mass upon systemic administration.
18616278:16	–
Site-specific drug delivery systems increase the therapeutic benefit by delivering a greater fraction of the dose at the target site, which minimizes the amount of therapeutic that accumulates at nonspecific targets.
18616278:17	Drug delivery throughout the tumor mass is crucial for the treatment to be effective, since residual cancer cell survival can promote regrowth and often becomes the cause for drug resistance.
18616278:18	For colloidal carriers, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, these barriers can be overcome through the unique properties of tumor neovasculature.
18616278:19	Angiogenesis (the formation of new vasculature) associated with rapid growth of the tumor mass results in fenestrations in tumor capillaries.
18616278:20	These fenestrations (or gaps between adjacent endothelial cells), are sized around 200−400 nm.
18616278:21	In addition, the lymphatic system, which usually runs alongside the blood circulation to clear macromolecules from tissues, is impaired in solid tumors.
18616278:22	This lack of lymphatic drainage results in decreased clearance of macromolecules (>40 kDa) within the vicinity of the tumor.
18616278:23	Together, these two physiologic parameters of the tumor mass, termed the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, can be taken advantage of to improve drug delivery to tumors mediated by nanocarriers.
18616278:24	Previous studies from our group have shown that paclitaxel (PTX)-containing PEO-PCL nanoparticles remain stable in vivo and retain the PEO copolymer (Pluronic) surface layer to increase the circulating half-life and plasma residence time of PTX from a fraction of an hour to 25.3 and 24.0 h, respectively, alongside a nearly 8-fold decrease in total body clearance of the drug.
18616278:25	The concentration of PTX inside the tumor mass of mice-bearing human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) xenografts, as a result, was 8.7-fold higher 5 h postinjection as compared to mice treated with paclitaxel solution, resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticle formulation over solution PTX, seen by the 63% reduction of final tumor volume.
18616278:26	To examine the effectiveness of PEO-modified PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticles for improving the tumor accumulation of the PTX + CER drug load, as a means toward enhanced efficacy, we have administered the control and test formulations to mice bearing drug sensitive (MCF7) and MDR (MCF7 TR) human breast tumor xenografts.
18616278:27	In this study, we have examined the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of PTX and CER upon administration in PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticle formulations in an orthotopic wild-type (drug sensitive) and drug resistant ( MDR-1 positive) MCF7 estrogen-positive human breast adenocarcinoma model.
18616278:28	While it is known that nanoparticles enhance drug delivery to tumors by the EPR effect, it is unknown whether MDR physiology has any further effect on tumor drug disposition and retention.
18616278:29	These studies, therefore, can allow for an interpretation of the effect of cellular mechanisms of MDR on tumor targeting of the drugs with blend nanoparticles.
18616278:30	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Although earlier work revealed the potency of a PTX + CER combination therapy to treat MDR ovarian cancer, it was observed that an important and interesting relationship existed within the kinetics of dosing PTX and CER.
18616278:31	Figure shows intracellular delivery of NBD-labeled CER using PLGA 70%/PbAE 30% blend nanoparticles in MCF7 and MCF7 TR cells and verifies that cell-kill efficacy increased significantly when CER was administered with a delay of several hours following PTX administration in MCF7 TR cells (Figure b), increasing from 39.1% cell death when the drugs were coadministered to 52.9% cell death when CER was administered 6 h following CER ( p < 0.05).
18616278:32	Interestingly, this increase was not observed when PTX was administered with a 6 h delay following CER (38.8% cell death) in this cell line.
18616278:33	Additionally, the enhancement of cell-kill with CER coadministration was not observed in MCF7 (drug sensitive) cells as well.
18616278:34	To incorporate this dose−kinetic relationship into the formulation, a nanoparticle system was designed that could simultaneously carry both the PTX and CER therapeutics, but release each in a controlled manner within the tumor cells.
18616278:35	To achieve this temporally controlled release, PLGA was blended with a pH-responsive polymer, PbAE, at a ratio of 70% to 30% respectively.
18616278:36	Table summarizes the characterization of these particles.
18616278:37	The particles were found to have an average size around 200 nm and a negative surface charge expected for the PLGA matrix.
18616278:38	PTX and CER were loaded into the particles at 2.5% (w/w) for PTX and 10% (w/w) for CER to ensure preservation of the molar dosing ratio examined in in vitro studies (Figure ) without compromising particle size or stability.
18616278:39	At this load, loading yield was 100% for both drugs as determined by quantitative analysis of PTX and CER.
18616278:40	The intention of this formulation was for PTX specifically to be localized with PbAE for immediate pH-responsive release upon internalization of the nanoparticles in the acidic tumor environment (pH 6.5).
18616278:41	CER then was intended to incorporate within the PLGA regions of the nanoparticle for a slower, more sustained release, unaffected by the drop in pH at the tumor site.
18616278:42	Thereby, the rapid release of PTX and the slower release of CER would impart the temporal controlled release profile that results in enhanced efficacy against MDR cancer.
18616278:43	In vitro release simulations (Table ) revealed just that: PTX experienced a surge in release upon a drop in pH to 6.5, while CER release remained unaffected when the pH decreased from 7.4 (physiological) to 6.5 (tumor).
18616278:44	When the nanoparticles were incubated in PBS at pH 7.4, a similar amount of PTX and CER was relased in a one hour span (10.3% PTX and 12.3% CER).
18616278:45	However, when the pH on the nanoparticles was dropped to 6.5 to mimic internalization into the tumor environment, PTX exhibited a surge of release (31.9% in 1 h) while the rate of CER release remained unchanged (7.6% in 1 h).
18616278:46	These results verify that PTX release preceded that of CER by this pH-responsive trigger.
18616278:47	With this formulation intact now, the effects on PTX and CER pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were examined.
18616278:48	To achieve a direct comparison between PTX and CER drug biodistribution and pharmacokinetics when administered as a conventional Cremophore EL-ethanol formulation versus encapsulation within the 70% PLGA/30% PbAE polymer-blend nanoparticles, both preparations were spiked with radiolabeled derivatives of PTX and CER.
18616278:49	Both 3H-PTX and 14C-CER were encapsulated within the nanoparticle and free drug formulations as described in in such a way that each animal received a tracer of 1.0 μCi of PTX and 0.5 μCi of CER of which the counts could be simultaneously read on an α/β- scintillation counter.
18616278:50	Furthermore, to qualitatively assess drug biodistribution, and particularly tumor localization, resulting from the dose formulation, both the free drug and nanoparticle forms of drug were additionally spiked with a red-fluorescent derivative of PTX (rhodamine-PTX), which could be visualized in vivo using an in vivo imaging module.
18616278:51	Quantitative data was obtained by standardizing 3H and 14C cpm from individual tissues or blood by the counts-per-minute (cpm) for the dose administered per gram of tissue or mL of blood, to express tissue and blood drug levels over time as % of dose/g or mL.
18616278:52	Figure a depicts the blood and tumor pharmacokinetic curves for both PTX and CER resulting from administration as free drug as compared to PbAE/PLGA blend nanoparticle delivery in mice bearing MCF7 drug sensitive orthotopic tumor xenografts.
18616278:53	As expected, the data shows that nanoparticle delivery prolongs plasma retention of PTX over free drug administration, indicated by a 2-fold increase in PTX from nanoparticle delivery over free drug (1.02 ± 0.25 versus 0.46 ± 0.08% dose/mL respectively, p < 0.05).
18616278:54	Similarly, tumor retention of PTX increases significantly with nanoparticle delivery of the drug, whereby at 12 h out 6.5-fold more PTX resides in the tumor mass compared with the free drug administration (0.53 ± 0.08 versus 0.08 ± 0.02%/g of nanoparticle versus free PTX, p < 0.001).
18616278:55	What is more striking is that while nanoparticles did not affect CER retention in the blood significantly, the nanoparticles cause significant CER accumulation at the tumor site, initially a 2-fold increase early on at 1 and 6 h, elevating to a 4.5-fold increase by 12 h.
18616278:56	Additionally, the maximal concentration of drug at the tumor site within this therapeutic window reaches a significantly higher peak with nanoparticle delivery over the free drug formulation (2.6 ± 0.4 versus 1.42 ± 0.5), a phenomenon that perhaps explains the efficacy seen with CER treatment alone.
18616278:57	Qualitative biodistribution images that traced red-fluorescent PTX (Figure b) similarly revealed that while drug accumulation can be observed in tumors of mice subjected to free drug treatment 6 h out, this signal is lost by 12 h.
18616278:58	However, the mice subjected to nanoparticle treatment retain their tumor accumulation signal beyond 6 h to retain visibility even at 12 h out.
18616278:59	This result further suggests that the nanoparticles are retained for prolonged periods of time in the tumor mass.
18616278:60	Similar results were seen in the blood and tumor pharmacokinetic profiles of PTX and CER when administered to MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice (Figure a).
18616278:61	While nanoparticle delivery had no effect on blood retention of CER over free drug administration, PTX retention in the blood resulting from nanoparticle delivery elevated significantly 2- to 2.5-fold over that of free drug, for example to reach levels of 1.08 ± 0.16 versus 0.43 ± 0.11%/mL at 12 h from nanoparticle versus free drug administration respectively.
18616278:62	Similar to the trend seen in the drug sensitive MCF7 tumor bearing mice, nanoparticles elevated not only PTX accumulation in the tumor mass 2-fold (0.15 ± 0.01 versus.
18616278:63	0.07 ± 0.00 at 12 h, p < 0.001), but particularly CER accumulation and maximal concentration (1.7 ± 0.13 versus 0.75 ± 0.1 at 6 h, p < 0.001).
18616278:64	Figure b depicts qualitative biodistribution images for the MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice that once more revealed that while drug accumulation can be observed in tumors of mice administered free drug 6 h out, this signal is lost by 12 h, while the mice subjected to nanoparticle treatment retain their tumor accumulation signal at both 6 and 12 h out.
18616278:65	Analysis of tumor and blood pharmacokinetic data by noncompartmental pharmacokinetics revealed how nanoparticle drug delivery altered key pharmacokinetic parameters for both PTX and CER.
18616278:66	Table and Table summarize the pharmacokinetic parameters of PTX and CER from free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in blood (plasma) and tumor respectively.
18616278:67	As suggested by the plots in Figure and Figure nanoparticle delivery increased area-under-the-curve (AUC) in blood, for PTX but not for CER (Table ).
18616278:68	While mean retention time (MRT), the elimination constant ( K ), half-life ( T 1/2) and volume of distribution ( V d) appeared unchanged for either drug between free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in the blood, nanoparticles did significantly lower the rate of total body clearance (Cl t) for PTX, albeit not for CER, thereby supporting the idea that nanoparticles promote prolonged PTX retention in the blood.
18616278:69	Oppositely, though, nanoparticles promoted a significantly increased AUC and decreased Cl t for CER in the tumor tissue (Table ), although at this site pharmacokinetics of PTX remained unchanged between nanoparticle versus free drug delivery.
18616278:70	Interestingly, though, it can be concluded from this study that nanoparticle delivery does benefit both drug treatments, by increasing PTX levels and prolonging PTX retention in the circulation, and by increasing CER retention and decreasing CER clearance from the tumor site.
18616278:71	Lastly, to determine the effects of nanoparticle delivery of PTX and CER compared with administration of free PTX and CER on nontarget distribution, drug distribution over time was monitored in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart, as illustrated in Figure for MCF7 tumor bearing mice, and Figure for MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice.
18616278:72	From this data, it appears that while nanoparticle delivery does not significantly alter peak concentrations of PTX or CER that accumulate the examined nontarget organs, nanoparticle delivery does appear to prolong clearance of either drug from these nontarget organs.
18616278:73	At 6 h postadministration, similar amounts of PTX and CER could be detected in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart of mice bearing either drug sensitive or MDR tumor types.
18616278:74	Twelve hours postadministration, traces of both PTX and CER are nearly undetectable in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart of these mice, suggesting clearance of the majority of the administered drug.
18616278:75	However, nanoparticle delivery of both PTX and CER are retained at a significantly higher level in these tissue types by 12 h postadministration.
18616278:76	Curiously, though, this effect is only observed in mice bearing the MCF7 tumor type, while no differences exist between nanoparticle and free drug retention at 12 h for the MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice.
18616278:77	Although a prolonged retention at nontarget tissues could be a factor for toxicity, extensive studies examining white blood cell counts and liver enzyme activity following both acute and chronic administration of this nanoparticle therapy revealed that the therapy was well tolerated since no such toxicity arises (data not shown).
18616278:78	Discussion 
It is widely known that nanoparticles are beneficial tumor targeting vehicles due to their passive targeting properties by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, whereby the added advantage of stealth shielding the particles with a poly(ethylene glycol/oxide) (PEO/PEG) surface modification avoids uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, thereby improving circulation time of the nanoparticles.
18616278:79	The formulation described herein is for a blend of slow releasing PLGA and pH-responsive rapid releasing PbAE for temporal controlled release of PTX with CER to treat MDR cancer, whereby the nanoparticle was surfaced modified with PEO to promote stealth shielding and prolonged circulation of the combination drug therapy.
18616278:80	Using radiolabeled derivatives of PTX and CER, namely 3H-PTX and 14C-CER, it was possible to quantitatively track drug distribution over time in vivo resulting from administration as free drug versus encapsulation within the polymer-blend nanoparticles.
18616278:81	Drug distribution was monitored in mice bearing either drug sensitive MCF7 or MDR MCF7 TR tumors, since differences between the physiology of these two tumor types could potentially lead to differences in drug disposition and retention at the tumor site specifically.
18616278:82	Surprisingly, there was no difference in magnitude between the tumor accumulations at 6 h after administration of free PTX, nanoparticle PTX, free CER, or nanoparticle CER between the drug sensitive and MDR tumors.
18616278:83	Beyond 6 h, levels of PTX and CER delivered by nanoparticles remained unchanged in the MCF7 tumors, while levels of PTX and CER delivered as free drug began to decrease.
18616278:84	Overall, the amount of tumor accumulation of both drugs administered in nanoparticles significantly exceeded that of free drug administration at some of the tested time points in the MCF7 tumor bearing animals.
18616278:85	This finding supports the hypothesis of enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-delivered drugs by the EPR effect.
18616278:86	However, the effects seen in the MDR MCF7 TR tumors were very different.
18616278:87	While the magnitude of drug accumulation between the two tumor types was no different, intratumoral levels of PTX and CER from both free drug and nanoparticle administration tumors dropped drastically in the MCF7 TR after 6 h to nearly entirely disappear from the tumor by 12 h after administration, whereas drug levels remained steady during this period in the MCF7 tumors.
18616278:88	This finding suggests that drug efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein mediate removal of both PTX and CER from the MDR tumor after 6 h, although, since only free drug is susceptible to efflux, we cannot conclude that the drugs must have been released from the nanoparticles by this time point.
18616278:89	Although the amount of nanoparticle-delivered CER reaching MCF7 TR tumors exceeded the amount of CER administered as free drug by 2-fold, similar to the results seen in the MCF7 tumors, we did not observe this increase in PTX delivered as free drug versus nanoparticles.
18616278:90	However, this result is in accordance with the prediction that the bulk of PTX releases immediately from this nanoparticle upon internalization into the tumor environment from a drop in pH. Unfortunately, the presence of P-glycoprotein efflux pumps appears to quickly remove the released PTX from the tumor site.
18616278:91	Nevertheless, the results still support the increased tumor accumulation of nanoparticle delivered drugs by the EPR effect in the MCF7 TR tumors as well, although retention of the drugs in the tumor site is hindered by the P-glycoprotein mediated efflux.
18616278:92	The systemic pharmacokinetic parameters of CER administered as free drug or nanoparticles were very similar in magnitude and profile between MCF7 and MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice.
18616278:93	Interestingly, in both animal models, plasma CER does not display a profile characteristic of instantaneous input.
18616278:94	Rather, CER blood pharmacokinetics exhibit profiles that are more representative of oral absorption.
18616278:95	Although the hydrophobicity of free CER may lead to longer residence times at the site of injection, nanoparticle formulations of CER behave similarly while not exhibiting such hydrophobicity.
18616278:96	It is unlikely that CER is prematurely released from the nanoparticle to linger at the injection site, since tumor pharmacokinetic results imply that CER is retained in the nanoparticle by 6 h after administration.
18616278:97	Since tumor and nonspecific target accumulation of CER follows a similar profile as PTX, with peak accumulation at 1 h after administration (with the exception of MCF7 TR tumors, where peak accumulation occurred at 6 h), it is again unlikely that peak CER plasma levels take place prior to 30 min after administration.
18616278:98	Unfortunately, the pharmacokinetics of CER and other sphingolipids following intravenous administration have not been evaluated to date by other groups, forbidding conclusive statements regarding plasma CER pharmacokinetics.
18616278:99	Thus, at this point, it can merely be speculated that CER perhaps resides on the surface of the nanoparticle rather than internally to behave more like free CER in the circulation.
18616278:100	This could cause CER of either formulation to linger at the injection site or sequester in more lipophilic compartments.
18616278:101	Systemic pharmacokinetics of PTX, on the other hand, behaved similarly to the pharmacokinetic profile obtained in other studies, and displayed a profile characteristic of instantaneous input whereby peak concentration occurred at the time of injection, with a subsequent disappearance of PTX from the plasma over time.
18616278:102	In both the MCF7 and MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice, PTX administration as free drug peaked upon administration, with a gradual decrease over time to culminate at nearly undetectable levels by 12 h after administration.
18616278:103	Nanoparticle administration, on the other hand, caused a prolonged retention of PTX in the circulation of both MCF7 and MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice seen by the increased amount of drug present in the circulation at 6 h after administration, compared to the amount of free drug present at this time point.
18616278:104	Although it appears that PTX retention is more prominent in the MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice over MCF7 tumor bearing mice, the magnitude of plasma drug level between these two animal models is very similar throughout all time points.
18616278:105	These results are supportive of the known effects of PEO-surface modification on nanoparticles to produce prolonged circulation by stealth shielding, and agree well with the blood and tumor pharmacokinetic profile determined for PTX from free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in SKOV3 tumor bearing mice.
18616278:106	An evaluation of nonspecific target accumulation revealed that PTX administration in nanoparticles did not significantly alter nontarget accumulation over that of free drug, with neither an increase nor a decrease in drug retention in the most perfused tissues.
18616278:107	This result is identical to similar studies conducted for nanoparticle versus free drug accumulation of PTX at nonspecific sites.
18616278:108	Although other studies have reported a decreased accumulation in liver, spleen, and lung resulting from nanoparticle administration, we did not observe such results.
18616278:109	On the other hand, although CER does not accumulate to any greater amount in nontarget tissues between free drug and nanoparticle administration, the nanoparticle dosage form does result in a prolonged retention of CER in all five nontarget tissues examined, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart.
18616278:110	It should be noted that this result was only seen in the MCF7 tumor bearing mice, while not in the MCF7 TR tumor bearing mice.
18616278:111	Given this inconsistency, it is uncertain whether CER truly is retained in nonspecific tissues for a prolonged period of time, since it is unlikely that the physiological differences between tumors would affect nontarget drug disposition.
18616278:112	Nevertheless, not only do the results demonstrate that nanoparticle delivery enhances tumor accumulation of drugs, supporting the well-known characteristic of nanoparticle tumor targeting by the EPR effect, but more importantly, the results demonstrate the effect that MDR tumor physiology may have on drug disposition at the target site despite EPR targeting.
18616278:113	This knowledge could help factor into the design of nanoparticle platforms to enhance tumor targeting even in the presence of physiological barriers such as the presence of P-glycoprotein.
18616278:114	Conclusions 
Long-circulating PEO-modified nanoparticles have been shown to accumulate preferentially in the solid tumor upon systemic administration.
18616278:115	In this study, we have examined the delivery of combination PTX and CER to modulate the apoptotic threshold in tumor MDR by formulating both of these drugs in a single PLGA/PbAE (70:30 by weight) blend nanoparticles.
18616278:116	When administered in an orthotopic (drug sensitive) MCF7 and multidrug resistant MCF7 TR human breast adenocarcinoma model established in the mammary pad of female nu/nu mice, the nanoparticle-mediated delivery enhanced circulating times in vivo and allowed passive targeting to the tumor mass.
18616278:117	The pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a trend for nanoparticle-mediated delivery of PTX toward the reduced clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation and tumor mass.
18616278:118	We anticipate that the decreased PTX clearance would have significant implication in the treatment of MDR tumors.
18616278:119	Overall, these results are encouraging for the development of multifunctional nanoparticle systems that can deliver combination therapy for synergistic effects, especially in refractory diseases.

21266039:0	Background 
High rates of employee injury within the health care industry are well documented[ - ].
21266039:1	Previous reports regarding the incidence of work related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD) indicate that physiotherapy (also known as physical therapy) and occupational therapy are two professions that are at high risk [ , ].
21266039:2	Studies amongst physiotherapists (PT) have revealed as many as 91% experience WRMD during their career with recurrence rates of up to 88%.
21266039:3	It has also been reported that 80% of PT experience symptoms in at least one body area over a 12 month period .
21266039:4	One in six PT have been reported to change their area of specialty or leave the profession as a result of pain or injury.
21266039:5	The physically demanding nature of work tasks and clinical demands are believed to contribute to this high incidence of WRMD amongst therapists [ - ].
21266039:6	This physically demanding nature has been observed to result in the adoption of awkward postures, such as bending and twisting . Additionally time pressures associated with the clinical environments can result in therapists not taking break entitlements in order to meet patient treatment demand . 
A similar prevalence of WRMD amongst occupational therapists (OT) has been extrapolated from a systematic review of the literature for other health disciplines . A recent report provided the first preliminary empirical evidence specific to OT, in which a convenience sample reported a career incidence of 80% and twelve month incidence of 63% for WRMD . These conditions may be associated with considerable personal and financial cost to individuals and have significant impact on the career path and retention of health professionals [ , ].
21266039:7	It is imperative that strategies to effectively prevent and manage WRMD are sought in order to reduce the burden on health professionals and sustain a viable workforce.
21266039:8	Prevention of WRMD in nursing professionals has been extensively investigated and whilst there are similarities in clinical environment, patient types , and some overlap in patient handling there is a need to explore strategies specific to PT and OT due to the different nature of their clinical tasks . Recommendations have been made around legislative requirements and policy statements issued by relevant professional bodies . Some studies[ , , ] have described strategies used by PT or OT in response to WRMD, however, there have been few investigations of strategies currently being used by these health professionals to prevent WRMD . Only one study of hand therapists (PT and OT) has investigated PT or OT views regarding strategies that could be implemented to further reduce risk of WRMD.
21266039:9	An exploratory investigation of these issues amongst PT and OT clinicians from across a range of clinical settings was required to inform future injury prevention efforts to help retain health professionals in clinical roles.
21266039:10	Due to the overlap between patient related factors and many clinical tasks completed by OT and PT clinicians, it was considered worthwhile to investigate risk factors and strategies to prevent WRMD amongst both OT and PT professionals.
21266039:11	In order to address this need, this investigation explored issues of WRMD as perceived by the health professionals working in these roles.
21266039:12	The first aim was to identify the risks perceived by PT and OT as most likely to limit their capacity to continue working in physically demanding roles.
21266039:13	The second aim was to identify strategies these health professionals are currently using, or believe could be used in the future, to enable them to continue to working in a physically demanding clinical environment.
21266039:14	Due to the exploratory nature of this investigation there were no specific hypotheses regarding the likely similarity or differences in responses between the two professional groups.

Discussion 
Conclusions 
This investigation has revealed that work postures and movements, lifting or carrying, patient related factors and repetitive tasks are perceived as key risk factors for continuing to work in physically demanding clinical roles.
21266039:16	Six themes for strategies to overcome these risk factors include organisational strategies, workload or work allocation, work practices, work environment and equipment, physical conditional and capacity, and education and training.
21266039:17	Further investigation regarding the relative effectiveness of the identified strategies is warranted.

15840162:0	Background 
Due to wide spread use of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) mobile phones they have become indispensable as communication tools and therefore any consequent biological effects should be considered as a high-priority environmental health issue.
15840162:1	However, to date, there is an inadequate knowledge on what biological systems could be affected by the use of these devices.
15840162:2	Biological effects of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) transmitted by mobile phones are still a matter of public and scientific discussion.
15840162:3	Sensations of burning or warmth around the ear , headache , disturbance of sleep , alteration of cognitive functions and neural activity , as well as alteration of the blood-brain barrier and a relative decrease in regional cerebral blood flow have been reported as effects resulting from mobile phone use . The potential tumorous effect of EMFs is still a subject of debates and research [ - ].
15840162:4	The hearing system is in the closest proximity to the device so that hearing is potentially the most affected target of thermal and non-thermal effects.
15840162:5	Moreover, the hearing system and particularly the cochlear outer hair cells (OHC) are known to be highly sensitive to a great variety of exogenous and endogenous agents and externally applied electric and magnetic fields are known to be able to produce some hearing sensation . Despite all these considerations and evidence, only recently, some studies have analyzed the effects of mobile phones on the auditory system . However, the results are not completely consistent.
15840162:6	Only limited research data concerning interaction between EMF emitted by mobile phones and auditory function and possible impact on hearing, are available in the literature.
15840162:7	The animal experiments using distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) did not show statistically significant changes on the OHC functionality of adult and developing rats exposed as long as 30 days 1–2 h per day to EMF at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequencies . 
No measurable change in evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) was detected and none of the subjects reported a deterioration in hearing threshold level after 10-min exposure to the EMFs emitted by mobile phones in a recent human study on possible effects of the EMF of mobile telephones on hearing .
15840162:8	Other studies based on the auditory brainstem response and middle latency response methods concluded that 30 min mobile phone use has no short-term adverse effects on the human auditory system . The small amount of publications shows that there is a big gap in the knowledge of potential biological effects of cellular phone use on hearing.
15840162:9	The aim of the present study was to assess the acute potential changes in human hearing function as a consequence of exposure to low-intensity EMF's produced by mobile phones at frequencies of 900 and 1800 MHz and a sham-exposure under double-blind conditions as determined by changes in transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and hearing threshold levels (HTL) in pure tone audiometry (PTA).
15840162:10	Methods 
The protocol of the study was elaborated in the frame of European Commission 5 th Framework project "GUARD: potential adverse effects of GSM cellular phones on hearing".
15840162:11	The study group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers (mean age 23.6 ± 1.2 years; range 18 – 29 years) without any evidence of hearing or ear disorder.
15840162:12	There were 18 males (mean age 22.8 ± 1.7 years; range 18 – 28 years) and 12 females (mean age 24.9 ± 1.8 years; range 18 – 29 years).
15840162:13	The participants satisfied the following inclusion criteria: age between 18 and 30 years, no history of otological disorder and/or familial hearing disorder, no self reported hearing difficulty or persistent tinnitus, no exposure to severe noise, no ototoxic drugs, no excess consumption of alcohol or drugs 24 hours prior the testing.
15840162:14	Instrumental examination: normal appearance of tympanic membrane on otoscopy, hearing threshold levels (HTL) in both ears no worse that 20 dB(A) at any of the standard audiometric frequencies between 0.5 and 8 kHz (Interacoustics AC-40 audiometer, Denmark), no evidence of conductive hearing loss based on air-conduction and bone-conduction audiograms, normal tympanograms and acoustic reflexes present in both ears for stimulation using a 1 kHz tone at 100 dB HL (Interacoustics AT 235 h tympanometer, Denmark), presence of clear recordable TEOAE, defined as SNR greater than 6 dB in two or more half octave bands centred at 1, 2 and 3 kHz (Otodynamics ILO-88 system, London).
15840162:15	All participants attended two study sessions: genuine and sham exposures.
15840162:16	The administration of genuine or sham exposure was double blind and counterbalanced in order.
15840162:17	Genuine or sham EMF exposures were performed on separate days (at least 24 hours apart) with the tested participant and tester both blind to the condition being used.
15840162:18	The study session consisted of baseline audiological and TEOAE measurements, genuine or sham GSM mobile phone exposure, and followed immediate repeated audiological and TEOAE measurements.
15840162:19	Post-exposure measurements were performed in the same order as pre-exposure for each participant.
15840162:20	Pure tone audiometry (PTA) consisted of air conduction using 2-dB steps in the test ear only.
15840162:21	TEOAE measurement was used to record TEOAEs according to "linear" protocol using clicks at 80 dB SPL.
15840162:22	(Analysis time was 20 ms, 260 stimuli).
15840162:23	Each TEOAE measurement run included a minimum of 260 "sweeps".
15840162:24	A TEOAE was defined as the response if its amplitude was more than 3 dB above the level of the noise floor.
15840162:25	Reproducibility more than 60% was considered acceptable for the analysis at 3 successive frequency bands ranging from 1 to 3 kHz.
15840162:26	GSM exposure utilized the normal output of a consumer mobile phone (NOKIA 6310) at full power for 10 minutes.
15840162:27	Fifteen participants received GSM exposure at 900 MHz (full power 2 W) and the other fifteen participants received GSM exposure at 1800 MHz (full power 1 W).
15840162:28	The exposure consisted of speech at a typical conversational level via an insert earphone to one ear, plus GSM exposure in either genuine (test) or sham (control) conditions.
15840162:29	All test were performed in a sound-treated 2.5 × 2.0 m booth.
15840162:30	The NOKIA 6310 GSM mobile phone without SIM card (checked for correct power output) was used for GSM exposure.
15840162:31	Control for carrier frequency, output level, transmit/receive mode of the mobile phone was utilized using specialized PHOENIX software.
15840162:32	Therefore the mobile phone was connected via serial data cable from the PC to the phone.
15840162:33	To simulate the normal use of a mobile phone the participants were simultaneously exposed to both GSM radiation and an acoustic stimulus (speech material 10 min of duration).
15840162:34	However, to prevent any possible effects from using the speaker in the handset, the speech material was delivered via an insert phone (EAR tone 3A ABR).
15840162:35	The insert phone was used without the ear tip inserted and, therefore, the tube was taped along the subject's jaw with the entrance of the tube placed at the tragal notch of the ear.
15840162:36	The standard speech material duration of 10 minutes, read out by male speaker, was digitally recorded on minidisk (Sony MiniDisc Recorder MDS 101).
15840162:37	Then the speech sample was filtered (Syntrilium "Cool Edit") amplifying the low frequencies of the speech to compensate to some extent for the frequency weighting of the tragal presentation, so that the speech did not sound too unnatural.
15840162:38	Having re-recorded the filtered material, the speech sample was calibrated in 2-cc couples (Bruel & Kjer type 4152, Denmark) to the required level in order to produce a sound pressure level at the ear drum equivalent to free field speech level of approximately 60 dB(A).
15840162:39	A sound replay system used to replay speech to the ear of the participant consisted of minidisk player, audiometer and insert earphone.
15840162:40	During the test session NOKIA 6310 mobile phone was fixed to the tested ear using special headband and positioning system, so that the centre of the radiated field should be over the entrance of the external ear canal.
15840162:41	All parts of the positioning system were made by non-metallic plastic materials in order to avoid any perturbation of the EMF emitted by the mobile phone.
15840162:42	The subjects tested were asked to perform an attention task so that they attend to the speech stimulus, such as counting the number of a specific word in the speech material.
15840162:43	After the completion of the GSM exposure the participants were asked appropriate questions about the speech material and their experience of any possible subjective effect from the exposure.
15840162:44	The study has been acknowledged by An Independent Ethics Committee of Kaunas University of Medicine and is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
15840162:45	Results 
The subjects tested in the study tolerated the EMF exposure of mobile phones quite well.
15840162:46	There were no subjective complaints after the exposure.
15840162:47	The means of air conduction HTL of PTA throughout the testing frequencies of pre/post genuine and pre/post sham GSM exposure are presented in Fig.
15840162:48	for 900 MHz exposure, in Fig.
15840162:49	for 1800 MHz exposure and in Fig.
15840162:50	for the total group, respectively.
15840162:51	The analysis of means of HTL of the PTA with the Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance and Exact Friedman Test did not reveal any statistically significant differences between pre/post genuine and pre/post sham exposure groups (p > 0.05).
15840162:52	As all of the subjects tested in the study had a normal hearing, recordings of TEOAEs were obtained (6–10 dB) above the noise floor through 1 – 3 kHz test frequency range for all sessions.
15840162:53	Reproducibility of TEOAEs was >60% (91 ± 3 % in average).
15840162:54	The mean amplitude shifts of the TEOAE measurements of pre/post genuine and pre/post sham GSM exposure are presented in Fig.
15840162:55	for 900 MHz exposure, in Fig.
15840162:56	for 1800 MHz exposure and in Fig.
15840162:57	for the total group, respectively.
15840162:58	Statistical analysis with the Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance and Exact Friedman Test did not reveal any statistically significant differences in mean TEOAEs amplitude shifts between genuine and sham exposure groups (p > 0.05).
15840162:59	The data collected showed that average TEOAE levels (averaged across a frequency range) changed less than 2.5 dB between pre- and post-, genuine and sham exposure.
15840162:60	The greatest individual change was 10 dB, with a decrease in level from pre- to post- real exposure.
15840162:61	The results of the present study suggest that 10-min exposure to EMFs emitted by GSM mobile phone did not cause any detectable alterations in neither PTA nor TEOAEs.
15840162:62	Discussion 
GSM mobile phones have become very commonly used throughout the world within a short period of time.
15840162:63	This has given rise to concern about potential influences of EMF emitted by mobile phones on health.
15840162:64	Although there is no clear evidence to demonstrate harmful physiological effects of EMF at the levels used by mobile phones, however, there is a widespread public concern that there may be some potential harm [ - - ].
15840162:65	Potential effects of mobile phone EMF radiation on hearing should be considered as one of the major priorities in the research of potential adverse effects of mobile phone use.
15840162:66	Mobile phones are usually held in the closest proximity to the external ear and therefore, EMF exposure at the ear is high due to radiation from a remote earpiece.
15840162:67	Since the cochlea is enclosed by very dense compact bone, located relatively deep, congested with the perilymph and endolymph, they all help to shield it from the mobile phone EMF .
15840162:68	However, the OHC of the inner ear are known to be the most sensitive and vulnerable elements of the auditory pathway.
15840162:69	If subtle cochlear involvements occur, they might be detected through changes in TEOAEs, which directly reflect the function of cochlear OHC.
15840162:70	Even minor changes in the functioning of OHCs, caused by various noxious factors, are known to considerably affect TEOAE amplitude [ - ].
15840162:71	On the other hand, TEOAEs represent acoustic responses of OHCs, which act like mechanoreceptor cells that generate force in their cell bodies to amplify sound and provide the exquisite sensitivity of the cochlea . Consequently, the piezoelectric properties of OHCs that are essential for hearing might be relatively easily damaged by external EMFs emitted by mobile phones.
15840162:72	Therefore, the present study in addition to conventional measures of HTL, which require a subjective response, employed an objective methodology of registration of TEOAE that is able to detect very small effects in hearing function with appropriate statistical power.
15840162:73	The experimental paradigm used in this study was the within-subject paradigm.
15840162:74	This paradigm provided audiological measurements immediately before and immediately after exposure to EMF via a commercial mobile phone.
15840162:75	As the procedure was conducted twice: one with a genuine exposure and one with a sham exposure, this approach maximized sensitivity to change, because between subjects' variations in the results were minimised by calculation of the difference between before and after measurements.
15840162:76	A double-blind design of the procedure maximized objectivity of the experiment.
15840162:77	EMF exposure dose used in the study was necessarily low but comparable with the use of the mobile phones in normal day life.
15840162:78	As stated above, statistical analysis of the results of the present study did not reveal any significant alterations of HTL after 10 min GSM mobile phone exposure.
15840162:79	However, the main focus of this study was to analyse the effects of EMF of mobile phones on the TEOAE recorded before and immediately after a sham and a genuine exposure in a group of young subjects.
15840162:80	The data collected showed that average TEOAE levels (averaged across a frequency range) changed less than 2.5 dB between pre- and post-, genuine and sham exposure.
15840162:81	Therefore the variability of the TEOAE recorded before and after the GSM exposure and the individual variability appeared to be small and not statistically significant.
15840162:82	This allows us to state that 10 min of EMF exposure at the maximum power (peak power: 1 W or 2 W according to the frequency) does not induce any measurable changes in the TEOAEs.
15840162:83	Some other unanswered questions of the present study should be mentioned.
15840162:84	The measurements used in the study have been restricted by the frequency spectrum of the commercially available TEOAE equipment.
15840162:85	Possibly, higher frequency instruments could be able to reveal more comprehensive information about the effects of EMF exposure . As the study protocol was based on the comparison of the measures of the audiological tests obtained before and immediately after EMF exposure, only a relatively long-term or chronic alteration in hearing function could be detected by the present investigations.
15840162:86	Some potential transitory, i.e. reversible, alterations in hearing function lasting for only a short time during the EMF exposure cannot be detected by these methods.
15840162:87	Therefore, the simultaneous measurement of hearing function during the mobile phone's EMF emission would be of scientific interest.
15840162:88	However, these implications could be considered as guidelines for further investigations.
15840162:89	Conclusion 
It could be concluded that a 10-min close exposure of EMFs emitted from a mobile phone had no immediate after-effect on measurements of HTL of PTA and TEOAEs in young adult human subjects and no measurable hearing deterioration at least at outer and middle ear and cochlear levels was detected in our study.

18523544:0	INTRODUCTION 
Diabetes definition - diabetes is a disease which is caused by the inadequate production of insulin by the body or by the body not being able to properly use the insulin that is produced thereby resulting in hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose levels).
18523544:1	Almost 10 % of the adult population of Pakistan suffers from diabetes mellitus.
18523544:2	Diabetes mellitus plays an instrumental role in causing diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diseases of skin appendages and gangrene.
18523544:3	Other serious complications include retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and lower-extremity amputations.
18523544:4	Although diabetes mellitus is an incurable disease, it can be managed very well.
18523544:5	Training in self-management is integral to the treatment of diabetes.
18523544:6	Proper management requires patients to be aware of the nature of the disease, its risk factors, its treatment and its complications.
18523544:7	Diabetes mellitus along with its complications contribute a significant amount of burden on the society.
18523544:8	Lack of awareness has resulted in an increased number of diabetics over the years.
18523544:9	This has resulted in a less efficient workforce and a huge economic burden on Pakistan.
18523544:10	This study was conducted to assess the level of awareness among the diabetics of rural and urban populations of Pakistan.
18523544:11	The aim of this study was to find out the areas which need more attention in terms of resources and planning.
18523544:12	METHODS 
This cross-sectional survey was conducted in July 2004 on randomly chosen diabetic patients of both rural and urban areas.
18523544:13	A total of 120 diabetic patients were surveyed from urban areas.
18523544:14	The urban areas included Lahore and Faisalabad.
18523544:15	Similarly, 120 diabetic patients from rural areas were surveyed as well.
18523544:16	The rural areas included Habibabad, Haveli Koranga and Baba Kanwal (all of which lie in Punjab province).
18523544:17	All the subjects answered a voluntary, confidential and self administered questionnaire.
18523544:18	It contained true/false type of questions which were aimed to assess the awareness of diabetes mellitus in relation to its definition, types, causes, symptoms, control, management, treatment, complications and its relation to other diseases.
18523544:19	A few examples of the questions asked are as follows: 1) To the best of your knowledge is diabetes a communicable disease True/False?
18523544:20	2) To the best of your knowledge does diabetes have anything to do with insulin True/False?
18523544:21	3) To the best of your knowledge does obesity have any relation to a person developing diabetes True/False?
18523544:22	Apart from such questions the questionnaire also gathered data about sex, level of education and socio-economic status.
18523544:23	All the surveys were administered in the presence of at least one of the authors.
18523544:24	Urban diabetic patients were surveyed in hospitals, schools, universities and their residences whereas rural diabetic patients were surveyed largely at village meetings ( chopaals ).
18523544:25	RESULTS 
The total number of rural diabetic patients surveyed was 120.
18523544:26	The majority of the population answered 6–10 questions correctly out of a total of 25 questions asked.
18523544:27	Similarly, 120 urban diabetic patients were asked the same 25 questions.
18523544:28	In this case, the majority of diabetic patients gave 16–20 answers correctly as shown in .
18523544:29	This contrast is the main feature of this study.
18523544:30	The mean awareness among the rural population was 13 (SD± 2) correct answers out of a possible 25.
18523544:31	In the case of the urban diabetic patients, the mean awareness was 18 (SD± 2) correct answers.
18523544:32	Out of the 120 urban diabetic patients surveyed, 71 were males and 49 were female.
18523544:33	In comparison, there were 88 males and 32 femals among the rural diabetics surveyed.
18523544:34	The data was also collected and tabulated based on the level of education of each participant.
18523544:35	It was determined that that in the rural cohort, almost half of the participants had never gone to school at all; comparatively, a quarter of the urban participants had no formal education.
18523544:36	The remaining breakup can be viewed in . 
DISCUSSION 
In the present study, we have sought to determine the awareness level of both urban and rural diabetic patients about the disease.
18523544:37	The strategy of this study was to prepare a questionnaire that would test the basic knowledge of diabetes mellitus, its definition, types, causes, symptoms, complications, management, treatment and relation to other diseases.
18523544:38	This survey was administered to both rural and urban diabetic patients.
18523544:39	Our study shows that the urban diabetic patients are much more educated about diabetes when compared with the rural diabetic patients.
18523544:40	Upon reviewing the answers to certain questions, a few more findings were discovered.
18523544:41	One was preference to use ‘ desi ghee ’ (a condiment high in cholesterol and saturated fatty acids) instead of cooking oil among both the rural and urban diabetic patients.
18523544:42	Another one was the preference to consume meat instead of legumes and vegetables.
18523544:43	One other finding which was prevalent among rural diabetic patients was their preference to consult hakeems (Muslim physicians) over doctors when it came to diabetes.
18523544:44	One factor which was observed to play a role in improving awareness was the level of education attained.
18523544:45	A well-educated person had a much higher awareness level than a person who had received no education whatsoever.
18523544:46	As a result, we want future studies to look into this factor, and assess to what extent this factor plays a role.
18523544:47	Female diabetic patients were found to be far less aware of diabetes mellitus when compared with the males.
18523544:48	One reason for this finding could be the low female literacy rate in Pakistan (6).
18523544:49	Again, it emphasizes that future studies should be carried out to determine the link between education and diabetes awareness.
18523544:50	The link between awareness and socio-economic status is another factor that should be studied more deeply.
18523544:51	It was observed during our study that diabetics belonging to poor socioeconomic status were less aware than those belonging to the higher class.
18523544:52	While conducting this research, the authors have inculcated ideas on how to improve awareness about diabetes mellitus.
18523544:53	In the short run, the authors believe that increasing the level of awareness among village elders in India and Pakistan would be a very potent strategy.
18523544:54	The organization in rural areas is such that all people are required to meet on a weekly or monthly basis at meetings known as chopaals where the village elders dispense their experiences.
18523544:55	In making the elders more aware, the trickling effect may make the general rural population more aware about diabetes mellitus.
18523544:56	Another strategy is to make the hakeems in the rural population more informed about the population’s level of awareness, and help guide them to increase the awareness of their patients.
18523544:57	The common rural citizen has a lot of fears concerning doctors and allopathic medication.
18523544:58	As a result, increasing the level of awareness of the hakeems could to some extent help the general population as well.
18523544:59	However, in the long run improving education standards and socioeconomic status is no doubt the cornerstone in enhancing diabetes mellitus awareness.
18523544:60	In conclusion, our study has provided direct evidence that urban diabetic patients are more aware than rural diabetic patients about diabetes mellitus.
18523544:61	We have provided some discussion with regards to other factors that determine the awareness level of diabetes mellitus.
18507502:0	The Origins of Unbalanced Reporting 
When it comes to the quality of health reporting, why is the bar set so low?
18507502:1	One problem is that today's health reporters may have been covering crime last week and politics the week before.
18507502:2	They have rarely been trained to understand the complexities of health research.
18507502:3	For example, in her survey of 165 reporters in the US (response rate 69.6%), Melinda Voss found that 83% (96/115) had received no training in interpreting health statistics, and a third said that understanding key health issues was “often” or “nearly always” difficult . While there are certainly studies in specialist medical journals that will be difficult for many people to grasp, nevertheless there may be some value in establishing a core set of scientific competencies for all health reporters.
18507502:4	Indeed, the Association of Health Care Journalists' Statement of Principles states that health reporters should “understand the process of medical research in order to report accurately”.
18507502:5	There is also a broader context in which medical stories get exaggerated—the 24-hour news cycle means that media organizations are battling for audience share, which in turn means that “the press has moved towards sensationalism, entertainment, and opinion” . Headlines are often written by news editors, rather than the article's reporter, and are particularly prone to exaggeration.
18507502:6	All of this sensationalism strays far from the reality of biomedical research, a slow process that yields small, incremental results based on long-term studies that always have weaknesses.
18507502:7	The origin of hype in health stories goes even deeper than journalists' lack of training and the hurried pace of broadcasting.
18507502:8	Ransohoff and Ransohoff have described medical researchers and reporters as “complicit collaborators,” both of whom may benefit from a sensationalized story . Researchers benefit from the publicity because it may increase citations to their study and help their chances of promotion or tenure, while a highly visible story of a dramatic medical breakthrough can boost a journalist's career.
18507502:9	Sensationalism occurs, they say, “when the participants stand to benefit from publicity without a corresponding penalty for misleading reports.”
18507502:10	HealthNewsReview.org
18507502:11	could now provide such a penalty with its public naming and shaming of poor reporting, which in turn may drive journalists toward more balanced reporting.
18507502:12	The Role of Medical Journals 
When a health story gets hyped, it is all too easy for medical journal editors to deny any responsibility.
18507502:13	The reality, of course, is that journal editors themselves are the third party in the “complicit collaboration”—the journal's press release is the usual mechanism for linking the researcher to the journalist.
18507502:14	Medical journals issue press releases about their upcoming studies partly because media publicity drives readers to the journal and builds brand recognition.
18507502:15	A bland press release may be less likely to get your journal and the study noticed.
18507502:16	Not surprisingly, a content analysis of journal press releases by Steven Woloshin and Lisa Schwartz found that these releases were themselves prone to exaggeration ; we suspect that press releases from research institutions and funding agencies may be equally as prone.
18507502:17	Woloshin and Schwartz argue that all journal press releases should include: (1) a section putting results into context, (2) a section for the study's limitations, (3) a statement of the study authors' competing interests, and (4) a summary of the quantitative results expressed using absolute rather than just relative measures.
18507502:18	Some commentators also feel that news embargoes—in which journals give reporters previews of an article if they promise not to report on it until an agreed-upon date—are merely a tool for a journal's self-promotion . While there may be some truth to that, Steve Connor, science editor of The Independent has argued that abandoning embargoes could result in journalists trying to scoop each other, with the effect of lowering the quality of the coverage.
18507502:19	One advantage of an embargo is that we make the journal article available to the public at the same time as the news story appears.
18507502:20	Given PLos' core principle of “engag[ing] the interest and imagination of the public”, we do invest resources into publicizing our papers.
18507502:21	At PLoS Medicine we try to predict which studies are likely to be of greatest public interest.
18507502:22	An editor (not a press officer) writes the press release, and we ask the study authors to fact-check it ahead of release.
18507502:23	We strive to keep our press releases sober in tone to reduce the chances of media hype.
18507502:24	We also write an Editors' Summary published as part of the research article, which is aimed at nonspecialists and includes a discussion of the study's implications and limitations.
18507502:25	We ask all reporters to include a link in their story to the freely available PLoS Medicine study, so that readers can assess for themselves its strengths and weaknesses.
18507502:26	And although we have no control over press releases issued by an author's institution, we routinely ask to see these releases and will advise the institution's press officer if we feel that a release exaggerates the study's findings.
18507502:27	Our “press release cycle” is, however, an imperfect art.
18507502:28	We have no say over how authors present their work when they talk with reporters.
18507502:29	We don't always get our predictions right—we didn't predict, for example, how much public interest there would be in a study examining acid-fast bacilli in tuberculosis-positive sputum , nor did we expect so little attention to a study on mental health disorders in Lebanon . And we have occasionally seen our studies sensationalized.
18507502:30	For example, a media storm (see ) surrounded our publication of a meta-analysis of all pre-licensing trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, including unpublished trials, on the efficacy of certain antidepressants .
18507502:31	Although much of the reporting was balanced and insightful—highlighting the study's finding that efficacy was seen only in severe depression and questioning why trials go unpublished and why drugs get approved based on weak evidence—we also saw over-simplified headlines such as “Antidepressant drugs don't work.”
18507502:32	The study's public availability did at least allow clinicians, policy makers, and the public to discuss and debate the paper, and at the time of writing this editorial, we have posted 40 such Reader Responses . 
A Shared Responsibility to Raise the Bar 
Schwitzer's alarming report card of the trouble with medical news stories is thus a wake-up call for all of us involved in disseminating health research—researchers, academic institutions, journal editors, reporters, and media organizations—to work collaboratively to improve the standards of health reporting.
18507502:33	The good news is that there are signs of change.
18507502:34	Two years ago, Ray Moynihan and David Henry guest-edited a special PLoS Medicine theme issue on disease mongering, the corporate creation of new diseases in order to sell treatments.
18507502:35	As they report in this month's issue, over the last two years there has been a growing number of high-profile articles on disease mongering, suggesting that “scepticism is building within the mainstream media” . The Wall Street Journal for example, recently ran a story on a new drug for restless legs syndrome under the headline “How Glaxo Marketed a Malady to Sell a Drug” . 
There is other good news.
18507502:36	Despite the risk that the media might over-promote the findings of genetic research (leading to so-called “genohype”), a study of 627 newspaper articles on gene discoveries found that only 11% contained such hype . And if you want to see further proof that medical reporters can be healthily skeptical and nuanced in their reporting, take a look at the stories that were graded 10 out of 10 by Schwitzer's project .
18507502:37	This is the kind of balanced journalism that we should all be working towards and one that helps to promote an informed and medically literate citizenry.
19557133:0	Introduction 
Meta-analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT's) are frequently undertaken as part of systematic reviews to estimate clinical effect sizes.
19557133:1	Effect size estimates based on meta-analyses are even regarded as superior to estimates from a single RCT, particularly when they serve as an input in Health Technology Assessments(HTA's) . But clinical effect sizes are only one of the many input variables needed for a HTA (others include estimates on incidence of morbidity and mortality, costs and utilities), and meta-analysis for estimating these other types of variables have been used to a far lesser extent .
19557133:2	However, in some cases (e.g. when data is available from different sources for similar study groups, but not for the specific study group under analysis), meta-analysis could be as strong a tool for good estimation of these other types of variables, as it is for clinical effect sizes.
19557133:3	This seems for instance the case for the estimation of the incidence of symptomatic rotavirus (RV) infections, including those that do not present to a physician or a hospital.
19557133:4	Despite common believe, several HTA studies showed this estimate to be influential on the cost-effectiveness of RV vaccination – .
19557133:5	However, many other studies considered only RV cases presenting to physicians and hospitals – some of them justifying this by claiming a lack of information on RV cases not presenting to a physician or hospital.
19557133:6	Nonetheless, a number of published studies recorded prospectively the incidence of symptomatic RV infections.
19557133:7	Moreover, De Zoysa and Feachem already pointed out that the incidence of symptomatic RV infections in a study group from Canada was similar to one from Bangladesh . This suggests that the incidence of RV diarrhoea may generally be similar between developing and developed countries, and that basic improvements in water supply, sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and education do not necessarily reduce this incidence.
19557133:8	In short, because (1) the incidence of all symptomatic RV infections can be an influential factor in estimating the cost-effectiveness of RV vaccination, (2) multiple community-based studies exist that assessed prospectively the incidence of symptomatic RV infections, and (3) it would be important for global public health policy to verify whether the incidence of symptomatic RV infections is similar around the world, we conducted a systematic review, including a meta-analysis, of community-based studies on the incidence of symptomatic RV infections.
19557133:9	To our knowledge this is the first meta-analysis on this subject.
19557133:10	The main aim of this meta-analysis is to produce reliable estimates of the incidence of symptomatic RV infections, which can then be used for HTA.
19557133:11	Since this incidence was shown to be highly age-dependent age is taken into account.
19557133:12	Methods 
The strategy used and the reporting hereafter is based on the QUORUM and MOOSE statement and follows Cochrane guidelines . JB, who determined the strategy, is a Biologist (BSc, MSc), Biostatistician (MSc), and current PhD student.
19557133:13	The strategy was implemented after conferring with PVD: vaccinologist and infectious disease epidemiologist (PhD); MVR: virologist and epidemiologist (PhD) and PB: infectious disease modeller and economist (PhD).
19557133:14	All these authors have worked and published on RV before.
19557133:15	Results 
Discussion 
We estimated the number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic RV infections per person-year of observation for children below 2 years of age, to be 0.31 [0.19; 0.50].
19557133:16	Excluding the high value (0.84) reported by Mata et al reduces this to 0.24 [0.17; 0.34].
19557133:17	Mata et al's estimate was based on a prospective follow-up study in Mayan Indians in Guatemala, living in poor, crowded areas.
19557133:18	Other studies conducted in similar poor and crowded areas reported much lower values for the incidence of symptomatic RV infections (e.g. , ).
19557133:19	This could be due to the local or ethnic pathogenicity of RV infections (e.g.: 39% versus 66% of RV infections were symptomatic in Velazquez et al and Mata et al respectively), or to a lower incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections combined (e.g. 0.6 versus 1.1 RV infections per person-year for children <2 years of age in Fischer et al and Mata et al respectively).
19557133:20	Also, the Mata et al study was performed at least 10 years earlier than the other studies included, and RV tests were performed on faecal samples that were frozen for 13 to 18 years.
19557133:21	However, it remains unclear whether these aspects explain the high incidence value.
19557133:22	The reported values of incidence of symptomatic RV infections apply to children below two years of age, and are based on data from different regions of the world (all continents, except for Australia and Europe), with different climates (from tropical to temperate), from populations with different socioeconomic status (from the slums of the City of Santiago in Chile to a middle-class suburban population in US), and at different times (1967–2003).
19557133:23	Although it has already been shown that the proportion of gastroenteritis due to RV is seasonal, and that the extent of this seasonality depends on region the meta analysis indicates region not to be an important determinant of the incidence.
15029253:0	Introduction 
After decades of warnings by environmental scientists, population biologists, and demographers (see especially ; ; ; ), it is becoming increasingly apparent to an enlarging group of people that the Earth is entering a sixth spasm of mass extinction of life, at least comparable to and, perhaps, exceeding in scope the five episodes that have preceded it ( ; ; ).
15029253:1	What has come to be known as biodiversity decline is best documented in areas where the flora and fauna are most completely understood, e.g., the United States, and correspondingly less well understood in the areas of the world supporting the greatest amount of biodiversity—the tropics.
15029253:2	To use as an example the country that has been the focus of our research for more than three decades—Honduras—and the group upon which we have specialized—the herpetofauna, it is evident that the modern study of the Honduran herpetofauna began with the research of John R. Meyer that led to his dissertation, which appeared in 1969.
15029253:3	study documented a known herpetofauna of 196 species, including 53 amphibians and 143 reptiles.
15029253:4	The current tally is 334 species, including 117 amphibians and 217 reptiles ( ; ).
15029253:5	With respect to the total count, there has been an increase of 138 species or 41.3% in the 33 years since 1969 to the present (although Meyer did not include five marine turtles species then known to occur in Honduran waters, nor five species of reptiles known in Honduran territory only from the Swan Islands, which are included in the total count of 334).
15029253:6	included 35 species in the cloud forest herpetofauna of Honduras, although one species included by him is not so included by us.
15029253:7	Presently, we can document the presence of 122 species in one or more cloud forest regions of Honduras.
15029253:8	This increase of 88 species (or 72.1% of the total now known) is largely a result of our field work in the country.
15029253:9	Forty-two of these 88 species (47.7%) have been described as new species since 1979.
15029253:10	In addition, populations of two species reported from cloud forest by have been described as new species ( and cloud forest populations of Meyer equal and respectively).
15029253:11	There is still significant mountainous terrain in Honduras supporting cloud forest that has been incompletely sampled herpetofaunally.
15029253:12	Such is the case with the Yoro Highlands, the Agalta Highlands, and the Santa Barbara Highlands.
15029253:13	Given the frequency with which new taxa have been added to the Honduran cloud forest herpetofauna (2.3 taxa per year since 1972), it can be expected that additional forms await discovery in these yet poorly known ranges.
15029253:14	Acting in contraposition, however, is a more recent trend toward decline of herpetofaunal populations, which has been documented in Honduras by and and .
15029253:15	This trend has been most evident in regions of the country in excess of 900 m in elevation and has most obviously affected the species composing the most distinctive group, i.e., those that are endemic to Honduras or otherwise restricted in distribution to Nuclear Middle America.
15029253:16	Of the 125 species belonging to this group, 52 or 41.6% are considered to have declining populations, to be extinct, or to be extirpated in Honduras.
15029253:17	This trend is extremely alarming, given the fact that the 125 species involved do not occur outside of Nuclear Middle America.
15029253:18	In light of the importance of the cloud forest environments of Honduras as centers of herpetodiversity and the accumulating evidence of the decline and disappearance of a significant amount of this diversity, it is the purpose of this paper to update our current understanding of the composition and distribution (both geographic and ecological) of this herpetofauna, to discuss its biodiversity significance, to examine its current conservation status, and to speculate on the future for this segment of the Honduran herpetofauna.
15029253:19	Materials and methods 
Fieldwork upon which this paper is based has been conducted by one or both of us since 1968.
15029253:20	The material collected has been reported in a number of publications written by one or both of us since 1971 and summarized in , and . 
The Coefficient of Biogeographic Resemblance algorithm was used to demonstrate herpetofaunal relationships among the cloud forest ecophysiographic areas examined in this study.
15029253:21	The formula is CBR = 2C/(N 1 + N 2), where C is the number of species in common to both formations, N 1 is the number of species in the first formation, and N 2 is the number of species in the second formation.
15029253:22	Physiography 
Honduras contains within its borders a major segment of the mountains of Nuclear Middle America.
15029253:23	Many of the ranges found within the country have portions high enough to support cloud forest.
15029253:24	Descriptions of the physiography of Honduras have appeared in and so this description will be limited to only those mountain ranges upon which cloud forest vegetation occurs.
15029253:25	Elevations high enough to support cloud forest are distributed throughout the Serranía the mountainous interior of Honduras, which is a portion of the Nuclear Middle American highlands.
15029253:26	The Serranía is traditionally divided into the Northern Cordillera and the Southern Cordillera, the latter distinguishable from the former by an overlay of Pliocene volcanic ejecta deposits.
15029253:27	Both of these cordilleras are interrupted by an irregular graben, called the Honduran depression, traceable from north to south through the Ulúa-Chamelecón Plain, the Valley of Humuya, the Comayagua Plain, and the Valley of Goascorán.
15029253:28	In effect, these physiographic features divide the mountainous interior of Honduras into four sectors, three of which are recognized as ecophysiographic areas on the basis of this division.
15029253:29	They are the Northwestern Highlands, the Southwestern Highlands, and the Southeastern Highlands.
15029253:30	The fourth sector is significantly larger than any of the other three and is broken into four ecophysiographic areas (see ).
15029253:31	Climate 
, in his opus on the amphibians and reptiles of Costa Rica, noted “the term cloud forest is often applied to forests that develop at an altitude where the temperature (6 to 10°C) causes water condensation that produces clouds, fog, and rain.
15029253:32	This zone may be at any elevation, and its degree of development is related to the amount of water vapor in the air.
15029253:33	Cloud forests usually occur where there are prevailing onshore winds that have their air masses uplifted along ocean-facing mountains.
15029253:34	In Central America, cloud forests develop principally on the windward slopes affected by the northeast trade winds.
15029253:35	In the system, cloud forests are regarded as atmospheric association within bioclimates that, in Central America, usually develop in the lower portion of the lower montane life zone under the influence of strong prevailing winds.
15029253:36	During much of the year these forests receive precipitation in the form of light mists.
15029253:37	In the drier seasons, much of the time they are enveloped in dense, dripping fog.”
15029253:38	Areas supporting cloud forest in Honduras are generally subject to a Highland Wet climatic regime.
15029253:39	This climatic type is broadly characterized by annual rainfall of >1500 mm and a mean annual temperature of <18°C.
15029253:40	The cloud forest regions occurring in the Southern Cordillera generally receive less rainfall than do those in the Northern Cordillera, part of the general effect of the dissipation of moisture in clouds carried by the prevailing winds arising over the Caribbean Sea as they sweep inland.
15029253:41	Climatic data are available for the nuclear zone and the buffer zone of Parque Nacional El Cusuco, a cloud forest reserve in the Sierra de Omoa in northwestern Honduras.
15029253:42	Annual precipitation in the nuclear zone is 2995 mm and in the buffer zone 2580 mm.
15029253:43	The rainiest months, in both cases, are October, November, and December, accounting for 45.1% of total rainfall in both zones.
15029253:44	The least rainiest months are March, April, and May, when only 12.1% of rainfall occurs in both zones.
15029253:45	Monthly temperatures range from 12.9°C in December to 20.2°C in April, with a mean of 16.7°C, in the nuclear zone and from 17.5°C in December to 23.1°C in April, with a mean of 20.6°C, in the buffer zone.
15029253:46	Vegetation 
The vegetation of the Honduran cloud forests is referable to two forest formations, as slightly modified from the work of which differ from one another on the basis of the amount of annual precipitation.
15029253:47	The formation characteristic of the cloud forests of the Northern Cordillera is the Lower Montane Wet Forest formation.
15029253:48	It is characterized by annual precipitation of >2000 mm.
15029253:49	The formation typical of the cloud forests of the Southern Cordillera is the Lower Montane Moist Forest formation.
15029253:50	It features an annual precipitation of <2000 mm.
15029253:51	presented information on the vegetation of Parque Nacional El Cusuco (Lower Montane Wet Forest formation), as follows: indicated that this forest formation, called ‘Zona de Vida Bosque Muy Húmedo Montano Bajo Sub-Tropical,’ is characterized by the presence of three strata.
15029253:52	The uppermost stratum consists of a closed canopy of trees attaining heights of 35 to 40 m of the following species: spp.; ; ; and . The middle stratum is composed of the forgoing species lying in the shade of the taller conspecifics mixed with and . The lowermost stratum is comprised of seedlings of the species in the middle and uppermost strata intermixed with palms such as and as well as and a great variety of ferns.
15029253:53	Many epiphytic orchids, bromeliads, and mosses are present, as well as lianas and vines.”
15029253:54	presented similarly limited data on floristic composition at two sites (at 1570 and 1650 m) in Parque Nacional La Muralla (both in Lower Montane Wet Forest formation), located in the Ocote Highlands of the northwestern portion of the department of Olancho.
15029253:55	They stated the following (p. 102): “At the 1570 m site, of 38 species with chest-high diameters of 5 cm or more, seven species were considered most important [based on numerical prevalence].
15029253:56	These species, in order of importance, are: sp.
15029253:57	(agua-cate); (nogál); (encinillo); (aceite de maría); (oreja de macho); (bel-lota); (palma pacaya).
15029253:58	At the 1650 m site, a group of 6 species (out of 30) were judged most important, based on frequency of occurrence.
15029253:59	These species, in order of importance, are: (aceite de maría); (encinillo); sp.
15029253:60	(aguacate); (bellota); (o[reja] de macho); (amargoso).
15029253:61	Five of these six species are of greatest importance as well at the 1570 m site.”
15029253:62	included data on the floristic makeup of the vegetation of the Lower Montane Moist formation in Parques Nacionales de Celaque and La Tigra, as follows: “The undisturbed forest is composed of three strata.
15029253:63	The upper stratum is composed of trees 25 to 30 m in height, principally of the species (bellota), (liquidámbar), (pinabete), (ocote), and sp.
15029253:64	(aguacate sucte).
15029253:65	These trees carry a moderate amount of epiphytic mosses, orchids, bromeliads, and aroids.
15029253:66	The middle stratum consists of sp.
15029253:67	(curtidor), (encino), (alámo blanco), (cedro), sp.
15029253:68	(guama), and various species of laurals.
15029253:69	The lower stratum consists of shrubs belonging to the families Compositae, Myrsinaceae, Rubiaceae, Saurauiaceae, and Verbenaceae and the genera , , and .” 
Composition of the cloud forest herpetofauna 
The herpetofauna of the cloud forests of Honduras is known to consist of 122 species, including 18 salamanders (14.8% of total), 38 anurans (31.1%), 27 lizards (22.1%), and 39 snakes (32.0%).
15029253:70	The salamanders are all members of the family Plethodontidae.
15029253:71	The anurans belong to six families, including the Bufonidae (4 species), Centrolenidae (1 species), Hylidae (17 species), Leptodactylidae (12 species), Microhylidae (2 species), and Ranidae (2 species).
15029253:72	The lizards are members of four families, the Anguidae (6 species), Phrynosomatidae (1 species), Polychrotidae (18 species), and Scincidae (2 species).
15029253:73	The snakes belong to five families, including the Typhlopidae (1 species), Boidae (1 species), Colubridae (31 species), Elapidae (3 species), and Viperidae (3 species).
15029253:74	Distribution and distributional relationships of the cloud forest herpetofauna 
Biodiversity significance and conservation status of the cloud forest herpetofauna 
As noted in the Introduction, the herpetofauna of Honduras is being subjected to the same anthropogenic pressures as have been demonstrated to be in effect elsewhere in the tropics.
15029253:75	The most substantial pressure is created by habitat loss as a result of deforestation ( ; and ).
15029253:76	Also significant is a threat of unsubstantiated origin (but see for a discussion of events elsewhere in the tropics) that is decimating amphibian populations in the country occurring at elevations in excess of 900 m ( ; ), thus conceivably impacting all cloud forest areas.
15029253:77	That these threats are impinging on herpetofaunal populations at 900 m and above is especially poignant, inasmuch as the herpetodiversity of greatest significance is distributed in these regions, especially those supporting cloud forest.
15029253:78	This most significant herpetodiversity consists of those species endemic to Honduras and those otherwise restricted to Nuclear Middle America.
15029253:79	Of the 334 species now known to constitute the Honduran herpetofauna (including six marine reptiles), 78 are country endemics (23.4% of total) and 47 are Nuclear Middle American-restricted species (14.1%).
15029253:80	A greater percentage of the amphibian species fall into these two categories than do the reptilian species.
15029253:81	There are 41 amphibian Honduran endemics (35.0% of total of 117 species) and 25 Nuclear Middle American-restricted amphibian species (21.4%), compared to 37 (17.1% of total of 217 species) and 22 (10.1%) such reptilian species, respectively.
15029253:82	Thus, a total of 125 species of amphibians and reptiles (37.4%) are either endemic to Honduras or otherwise restricted to Nuclear Middle America.
15029253:83	Of these 125 species, 83 or 66.4% are distributed in cloud forests in Honduras.
15029253:84	Of the remaining 209 Honduran species not found in cloud forests, only 42 species or 20.1% are Honduran endemics or Nuclear Middle American-restricted.
15029253:85	It is obvious that the large majority of the species of greatest biodiversity significance is found in cloud forests.
15029253:86	As indicated above, deforestation is eroding forest resources throughout the country.
15029253:87	presented estimates, based on a computer model in suggesting that the current deforestation rate is −2.3%, giving rise to a halving rate of 30.1 years.
15029253:88	At this rate, only a half a million hectares of forest will remain in Honduras by the year 2085 and none will remain by the end of the current century.
15029253:89	This trend has been affecting cloud forests in Honduras, just as it has everywhere else in the country, and continues to the present day.
15029253:90	It has been abated somewhat by the establishment of biotic reserves in several of the ranges supporting cloud forest.
15029253:91	This establishment largely has been the result of an effort to secure water supplies for populated areas.
15029253:92	As noted by however, most of these reserves are incompletely developed, such that deforestation still proceeds in many, if not all of them (e.g., ), as a result of illegal logging and subsistence farming.
15029253:93	It has been demonstrated in recent years that populations of many Honduran amphibians and reptiles are in decline or have disappeared altogether, as part of a global pattern.
15029253:94	have provided the most recent assessment of this trend for the Honduran herpetofauna.
15029253:95	However, their assessment differs somewhat from the one undertaken here.
15029253:96	considered the range as a whole for each species when classifying whether a given species had stable populations somewhere in their range.
15029253:97	However, a few species may have stable populations at some low elevation localities, but may be extirpated from their known cloud forest localities (e.g., ).
15029253:98	Thus, the conservation status categories in this paper refer only to cloud forest populations.
15029253:99	lists the conservation status for each of the 122 species at their known cloud forest localities.
15029253:100	These data indicate that 40 species (32.8%) have populations that are in decline, eight species (6.6%) have disappeared altogether from cloud forests, and 16 species (13.1%) are too poorly known to determine their status in Honduran cloud forests.
15029253:101	Fifty-eight species (47.5%) appear to have stable populations in at least one cloud forest locality.
15029253:102	When one considers only the two most important components of the Honduran cloud forests (the Honduran endemics and the Nuclear Middle American-restricted species), then 15 of the 48 Honduran endemics (31.3%) have declining populations, six endemics (12.5%) have disappeared, five endemics (10.4%) are too poorly known to determine their status, and 22 endemics (45.8%) appear to have stable populations in at least one cloud forest locality.
15029253:103	Of the 35 Nuclear Middle American-restricted species, 20 (57.1%) have declining populations, one (2.9%) has disappeared, two (5.7%) are too poorly known, and 12 (34.3%) appear to have stable populations in at least one cloud forest locality.
15029253:104	Thus, about one half of the 83 Honduran endemics or Nuclear Middle American-restricted species have declining populations (35 species or 42.2%) or have disappeared from Honduran cloud forests (seven species or 8.4%).
15029253:105	Of the six Honduran endemic species that have disappeared from cloud forests, five are feared extinct.
15029253:106	These are shocking statistics, considering the importance of these species not only biologically, but also from conservation and ecotourist standpoints.
15029253:107	From simply a biological standpoint, the systematics of the majority of the 83 cloud forest notables (Honduran endemics and Nuclear Middle American-restricted species) are insufficiently understood to be subjected to cladistic analysis, a requirement for reconstructing their phylogenies, and, beyond this, their biogeographic histories.
15029253:108	These species are particularly important in our effort to understand the general patterns of evolution of the herpetofauna and to take that understanding beyond the work done on this subject to date.
15029253:109	From the perspective of conservation biology, we have demonstrated here and elsewhere ( and ; ; ) that the herpetofauna is anything but the pedestrian compendium alluded to in conclusions when they wrote that, “The anuran fauna seems to be derived from largely widespread species and species with northern affinities.”
15029253:110	Quite to the contrary, the work that has been accomplished since Lynch and Fugler published their paper 38 years ago has shown that slightly more than a third (37.4%) of the Honduran herpetofauna is composed of endemics or otherwise Nuclear Middle American-restricted species.
15029253:111	Our work in cloud forests has provided the major support for that conclusion.
15029253:112	The economic value of the Honduran cloud forests for ecotourism is only beginning to be calculated.
15029253:113	It is stunningly evident to us, however, based on the several decades of our field work in the country, that efforts to develop an ecotourist-generated component to the Honduran economy is likely to be doomed by the uncontrolled human population growth that continues to stymie efforts to conserve the considerable biodiversity of the country.
16512893:0	Background 
Cataract extraction is the most frequently performed surgical intervention in developed countries . Because of the high prevalence of cataract development and the increasing number of patients requiring cataract extraction, managers must decide how to prioritize patients.
16512893:1	Different priority criteria for cataract extraction have been created in the past in different countries, but none has included the appropriateness of the intervention [ - ].
16512893:2	The RAND-UCLA group in the United States  developed methodology to establish explicit criteria in the 1980s.
16512893:3	This is a very popular methodology that has been used for many different diagnostic and therapeutic procedures since that time and lately for different applications [ - ].
16512893:4	The purpose of the current study was to develop priority criteria, using the RAND method, for patients undergoing cataract extraction and to consider the appropriateness of the indication.
16512893:5	Methods 
Results 
A panel of 11 experts scored 310 scenarios.
16512893:6	Figure shows the panel scores for the priority score as a continuous variable.
16512893:7	The histogram resembles a normal plot and fulfills normality (p = 0.12 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
16512893:8	The panelists' scores tended to be similar (Table ), except for panelists 5, and 6, who had the extreme high and low mean and median scores.
16512893:9	Table shows the classification of the panelists' scores in three categories from high to low priority.
16512893:10	Of the 310 indications they evaluated, 22.6% had a high priority, 52.3% intermediate priority, and 25.2% low priority.
16512893:11	Agreement was reached for 31.9% of the indications and disagreement for 0.3% (Table ).
16512893:12	We evaluated the contribution of each variable included in the algorithm by means of general linear and logistic regression models (Table ).
16512893:13	Globally, the general linear model indicated that the most influential variables were the visual acuity in the cataractous eye, the anticipated visual acuity postoperatively, and the visual function.
16512893:14	Social dependence and the type of cataract had the lowest effect, although, in all cases, the effect reached statistical significance.
16512893:15	The logistic regression model indicated that the same three variables were the most important but in a different order, i.e., the visual function, the visual acuity in the cataractous eye, and the anticipated postoperative visual acuity.
16512893:16	The other variables were not statistically significant in this model.
16512893:17	Appropriateness of the intervention, despite being forced to enter in the model after the rest of the variables to avoid collinearity, remained highly significant and fourth in the order of importance in both models.
16512893:18	We present two alternative methods of obtaining a simpler way to obtain the priority score: optimal scaling and general linear models (Table ).
16512893:19	The anticipated postoperative visual acuity and the visual acuity in the cataractous eye correspond to the highest weights (21 points each), followed by visual function, appropriateness, and the visual acuity in the contralateral eye.
16512893:20	The presence of ocular comorbidities, social dependence, and laterality had less than 10 points.
16512893:21	The weights obtained using the general linear model were similar and in the same order.
16512893:22	In addition, these methods give different distances among categories within a variable.
16512893:23	We studied the correlation of the scores obtained between the two scoring methods with the priority scores of the original panel.
16512893:24	The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.95 for the optimal scaling model and 0.97 for the general linear model.
16512893:25	Using the Spearman correlation coefficient, the results were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively.
16512893:26	Finally, the criteria developed by the panel of experts were summarized by CART analysis on a decision regression tree (Figure ), which shows that the highest priority was given to the scenarios considered first as appropriate.
16512893:27	This is followed by visual function (difficulties with daily activities), visual acuity in the cataractous eye (= 0.4), visual acuity in the contralateral eye, and the anticipated postoperative visual acuity.
16512893:28	We collected information on 936 patients to identify which of the theoretical indications were used in clinical practice.
16512893:29	Globally, 102 of 310 theoretical (33%) indications were assigned to 936 patients.
16512893:30	By diagnostic group, for simple cataract, 53 of 86 theoretical (62%) indications were assigned to 761 patients with that diagnosis.
16512893:31	Of those with diabetic retinopathy, 11 of 118 theoretical (9%) indications were assigned to 19 patients.
16512893:32	Of those with other ocular pathologies, 38 of 106 theoretical (35.8%) indications were assigned to 156 patients with that diagnosis.
16512893:33	Discussion 
Cataract extraction has been chosen by different researchers to develop priority scoring systems of [ , ].
16512893:34	The drawback of all systems is that they do not take into account the appropriateness of the intervention as a previous consideration.
16512893:35	Our study incorporates this variable on the priority algorithm, and we show that it plays an important role in patient prioritization.
16512893:36	To develop our system of prioritization, we used the RAND methodology.
16512893:37	Although the RAND methodology was developed primarily to create appropriateness explicit criteria, it also can be used for other purposes (9;17;18).
16512893:38	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the RAND methodology has been used to develop priority criteria linked with previous appropriateness criteria.
16512893:39	We first determined the appropriateness of the indication criteria in two panel rounds.
16512893:40	We then selected those indications ultimately classified as appropriate or uncertain.
16512893:41	The fact that the appropriate indications were entered in the prioritization algorithm seems logical; however, why should uncertain surgical indications be included?
16512893:42	First, because as in some studies in which appropriateness had been related to outcomes, the outcomes of the appropriate and uncertain cases seemed similar . Uncertainty does not indicate that the intervention should not be performed, but rather that either that the panel did not reach agreement or that the panel's opinion is that there is uncertainty about whether the intervention is worthwhile because of lack of evidence or panel experience or ambiguous results.
16512893:43	Second, we considered that social dependence, a new variable in our algorithm, might result in an uncertain scenario being considered as appropriate.
16512893:44	As other authors who had worked with this methodology pointed out, other circumstances not included in the appropriateness criteria may play an important role in clinician decision making for indicating an intervention.
16512893:45	More RAND appropriateness criteria had in common that they include clinically relevant variables but not socially relevant variables or those important to the patient . We considered that social dependence is important in many clinical situations but mainly to prioritize patients.
16512893:46	Focus groups performed by our group and other groups studying cataract have shown that patients believe that social dependence is much more relevant than other clinical variables . But also because social dependence has been included in previous priority scoring systems . 
We initially spent considerable effort defining what we consider priority.
16512893:47	Priority differs depending on the health problem and its probability of leading to death or important permanent handicaps if untreated.
16512893:48	That introduces the concept of urgency, i.e., if not treated promptly death will result , as with myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular problems, in which the risk of death or incapacity is often present.
16512893:49	However, cataract itself never implies the risk of death for the patient.
16512893:50	In this case, we then defined priority in terms of the benefit of the intervention to the patient.
16512893:51	The higher the benefit for the patient, with similar low risks, the higher the priority of the intervention.
16512893:52	We understand the benefit as the highest gain in the quality of life or living or working independently for the patient, which would be correlated with relevant improvements postoperatively in their ability to function.
16512893:53	With cataract, this improvement should not only correlate with improved visual acuity (either measured by Snellen or lines of improvement or changes in the log MAR visual acuity), as reported by the ophthalmologist, but also with a relevant improvement in visual function, as reported by the patient.
16512893:54	If a patient with a preoperative visual acuity of 0.3 and another with 0.1 or less are expected to have improvements in visual acuity to 1.0 and 0.7, respectively, with the rest of their circumstances equal, who should undergo surgery first?
16512893:55	The absolute gain in the first case (0.7) is superior to the second (0.6); however, considering functionality, while the visual acuity of the first patient probably imposed limitations, he or she likely could perform some daily activities but was fully functional after surgery.
16512893:56	The second patient, who would be legally blind in our country, has a visual function much poorer than the first patient; therefore, a visual acuity improvement to 0.7 may allow him or her to manage daily activities or live independently.
16512893:57	The improvement in the second patient has greater relevance considering the quality of life.
16512893:58	As we pointed out previously, most priority criteria developed thus far did not consider the appropriateness of the intervention.
16512893:59	Some may assume that all patients on the waiting list are appropriate candidates, which it is not necessarily true.
16512893:60	Our results from both the general linear model and the CART analysis indicated that appropriateness was an important variable for the panelists when scoring the priority of each scenario.
16512893:61	As reported previously, the rate of inappropriate interventions ranges from 1.3%  to 7.7%  depending on the study.
16512893:62	Although compared to other appropriateness RAND studies those rates are relatively low [ - ], an inappropriate intervention should not be considered for prioritization.
16512893:63	However, in the previous studies, uncertain indications ranged from 7% to 36.8%.
16512893:64	Because they occur much more frequently, they should be considered carefully.
16512893:65	To the best of our knowledge, one recent study attempted to match appropriateness and priority .
16512893:66	However, although the development of appropriateness criteria followed RAND methodology similar to ours, the development of the priority criteria differed and resembled previous studies.
16512893:67	Other studies in Canada  and New Zealand [27] developed priority criteria by different methods, some of which have been questioned (4).
16512893:68	The Canadian group used similar statistical methodology (optimal scaling) to generate a simpler scoring system . In any case, all of them share similar variables in their priority algorithm as ours.
16512893:69	We presented the results of the panel scoring as a categorical variable or continuous variable.
16512893:70	To construct the categorical variable, with three categories of priority (from high to low), we used the same algorithm to develop the three RAND categories of appropriateness (appropriate, uncertain, inappropriate).
16512893:71	An advantage is that this system may match current priority setting norms in some places such as ours.
16512893:72	A disadvantage is that it can seem artificial, or with no conceptual base, to have those categories.
16512893:73	On the other hand, the continuous variable provides a priority order for all scenarios, but it can seem less practical.
16512893:74	Daily use will determine which one is more useful.
16512893:75	On the other hand, to have an easily usable algorithm, we presented our results simply.
16512893:76	We presented two alternative priority scoring systems, one developed by optimal scaling and the other by a classical general linear model.
16512893:77	The importance of the variables and the weights assigned to the different categories of variables were similar.
16512893:78	In addition, both had very high Pearson and Spearman correlations with the original panel scores.
16512893:79	An alternative way to use the real panel scores can be provided by simple software that allows the final score to be obtained by clicking on the categories of each variable.
16512893:80	We are working on this alternative method.
16512893:81	Finally, we presented a decision tree that provides a global idea of which clinical situations should be treated first and indicates the importance of assessing the appropriateness of the intervention for prioritization.
16512893:82	In conclusion, this is the first study to combine the appropriateness of an indication with priority criteria following the same methodology.
16512893:83	Our results show that appropriateness plays an important role in priority decision making process.
16512893:84	The variables included also were identified by other authors, which adds validity to our criteria.
16512893:85	We also provide alternative scoring algorithms that allow ease of use of our criteria in clinical practice.
16512893:86	Use of them will let us know which one is more useful.
16512893:87	Nevertheless, more sophisticated future proposals should include the algorithm in flow models [28] that allows management of patients placed on a waiting list.

17615904:0	INTRODUCTION 
Vitamin A supplementation has shown a beneficial effect on childhood mortality, but its effect on morbidity is not clear.
17615904:1	Deficiency of zinc and vitamin A are widespread in developing-country settings, and they often co-exist.
17615904:2	Zinc deficiency could affect the bioavailability of vitamin A and, thereby, prevent the beneficial effect of vitamin A in reducing morbidity.
17615904:3	In animal models, zinc deficiency is associated with reduced retinol levels.
17615904:4	In zinc-deficient rats, zinc supplementation, not vitamin A supplementation, increased serum retinol levels.
17615904:5	Data from human studies evaluating the effect of zinc supplementation on vitamin A status are limited and are inconclusive.
17615904:6	Some studies have reported beneficial effects of zinc on plasma vitamin A concentration ( – ), while other studies failed to confirm these findings.
17615904:7	In a double-blind randomized, controlled trial, we demonstrated the preventive effects of supplementation with zinc and vitamin A (intervention group) compared to the same preparation without zinc (control group).
17615904:8	Supplementation reduced diarrhoea by 26% (13–38%), persistent diarrhoea by 33% (6–52%), and pneumonia by 45% (10–67%).
17615904:9	As the intervention group received both zinc and vitamin A, a possible hypothesis for this effect was that zinc supplementation improves the plasma retinol levels, which, in turn, is responsible for the preventive effects on morbidity.
17615904:10	To evaluate this hypothesis, we undertook the present study in a random sample of 200 children.
17615904:11	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
Of the 200 children selected for the study, 10 children in the intervention group and six in the control group did not consent to blood withdrawal; hence, the final analysis was done with 184 children.
17615904:12	Children in the intervention and the control group were comparable for all assessed baseline characteristics, including plasma zinc concentrations (intervention 66.3±14.3 μg/dL; control 66.7±25.3 μg/dL).
17615904:13	The characteristics of the children in this sample of 184 were also comparable with the overall sample of 609 in the main study (data not shown).
17615904:14	Plasma retinol concentrations after 120 days of the supplementation were very similar in the intervention and control groups.
17615904:15	Further, subgroup analysis by age (<12 months and ≥12 months), baseline plasma zinc levels (<60, 60–80, and >80 μg/dL), and nutritional status (normal, stunted, wasted, and wasted and stunted) did not show any difference in the plasma retinol levels between the two groups.
17615904:16	The proportion of children with post-supplementation plasma retinol below 20.0 μg/dL (vitamin A-deficient) was also not significantly different between the intervention (38%) and the control group (41%), odds ratio (OR)=1.17 (95% CI 0.62–2.20, p=0.61).
17615904:17	DISCUSSION 
In the present study, significant improvement in zinc status was not accompanied by differences in the post-supplementation plasma retinol levels between the children getting vitamin A with zinc and the children getting vitamin A without zinc.
17615904:18	A potential limitation to the study is that interpretation of these results is based on two assumptions: that vitamin A status for the two groups was comparable at baseline and that serum retinol has adequate sensitivity to assess improvement in vitamin A status.
17615904:19	The trial was a randomized double-blind trial, and in all assessed variables, the groups were comparable at baseline (plasma zinc and nutritional status).
17615904:20	Serum retinol done immediately after the completion of 120 days of the supplementation is a reasonably-sensitive indicator of vitamin A status.
17615904:21	Thus, it is unlikely that these potential limitations would have biased the results.
17615904:22	Zinc is important for synthesis of retinol-binding protein (RBP), prealbumin, and hepatic cellular RBP (cRBP) and for the intracellular transport of retinol within liver hepatocytes.
17615904:23	Vitamin A binds to RBP within the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte forming holo-RBP, which is secreted into the blood.
17615904:24	Prealbumin forms a tri-molecular complex with retinol and RBP which conserves vitamin A by preventing its filtration and loss in the urine.
17615904:25	Hence, zinc is essential for both intra- and inter-cellular transport of vitamin A.
17615904:26	Zinc also aids in the absorption of vitamin A in the intestine.
17615904:27	Our findings are consistent with findings of only two other studies in children, which had a longer duration of supplementation.
17615904:28	These studies did not find any difference in the post-supplementation vitamin A levels among the groups receiving zinc alone, vitamin A alone, vitamin A with zinc, and placebo group.
17615904:29	A recent randomized community-based trial in Bangladesh, with a factorial design of vitamin A and zinc, did not find any difference in the mean retinol levels between zinc or zinc/vitamin A groups compared to the placebo.
17615904:30	In the same study, in the sub-group of children with vitamin A levels below 20.0 μg/dL at baseline, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of children with plasma retinol levels of <20.0 μg/dL after supplementation in the zinc and vitamin A group compared to the vitamin A-alone group.
17615904:31	Children who were vitamin A-deficient at baseline in the Bangladesh study were deficient despite a mega dose of vitamin A given to them in the previous six months.
17615904:32	In essence, children enrolled in that study represented a non-responding vitamin A-deficient subpopulation.
17615904:33	We also did not find any difference in the proportion of children with <20 μg/dL of plasma retinol levels between the two groups after supplementation.
17615904:34	The number of children with vitamin A levels of <20 μg/dL in this study was not very different from Bangladesh.
17615904:35	This would exclude differences due to lack of severe deficiency in the study population.
17615904:36	All the three studies reporting an interaction ( – ) gave a large dose of vitamin A and had a short-term effect assessment (1–2 week(s)).
17615904:37	Short-term high-dose supplementation of vitamin A may produce effects that are eventually counteracted by adaptation over a longer period of supplementation.
17615904:38	Similar results have earlier been reported in trials in selected subpopulations, such as severely-malnourished children where supplementation with 40 mg/dL of zinc for 5–10 days resulted in a significant increase in vitamin A levels, but there was no change in vitamin A-deficient children.
17615904:39	In our study, no difference was found in the plasma retinol levels in children who were zinc-deficient at baseline (plasma zinc of <60.0 μg/dL) or children who were below <-2 z -score of the NCHS standards for weight-for-height or age.
17615904:40	In conclusion, given similar plasma retinol levels in both intervention and control groups after 120 days of supplementation, it is unlikely that the observed effects of morbidity with zinc supplementation in our study ( – ) could have been mediated by an interaction of zinc with vitamin A.
17615904:41	Further studies are needed to look into this question and to evaluate if giving a single large dose of vitamin A and zinc or a large dose of vitamin A with prolonged zinc supplementation may potentially have different effects on vitamin A status.
17615904:42	As this has implications for supplementation programme, the effect of such a strategy needs to be evaluated in a community-based trial of adequate duration.

15640450:0	INTRODUCTION 
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal types of DNA damage, and eukaryotic cells have evolved two major pathways to repair DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
15640450:1	The NHEJ pathway requires the heterodimeric protein Ku, which consists of a 70 kDa subunit and 80 kDa subunit.
15640450:2	Ku binds to the ends of DSBs and recruits the 470 kDa DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs).
15640450:3	Together Ku and DNA-PKcs make up the complex termed DNA-PK holoenzyme.
15640450:4	DNA-PK activation, an essential step in the repair process, occurs once the kinase assembles at the site of DSB.
15640450:5	The activation of DNA-PK may signal to other downstream components involved in signal transduction of the damage event.
15640450:6	This active DNA-PK complex may then recruit other factors including the MRN complex, Artemis and the DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex, which are potentially involved in processing of the termini and completing the repair process.
15640450:7	The interaction of Ku with DNA has been the subject of extensive analysis.
15640450:8	DNA double-stranded termini display the greatest affinity for Ku.
15640450:9	A significant advance in our understanding of Ku structure and function was revealed when the co-crystal structure of Ku bound to a duplex DNA was determined.
15640450:10	In this structure, each subunit of Ku encircles the duplex DNA in a ring-like structure, with a large base on which the DNA rests.
15640450:11	Two pillars support a bridge-like structure through which the DNA strand can thread.
15640450:12	Further analysis of this crystal structure reveals that while there are no direct interactions with the DNA bases, specific amino acids protrude into the major and minor grooves of the DNA so as to provide a helical guide through the ring structure of Ku.
15640450:13	Additional studies have revealed that Ku binds and orients itself at a DNA terminus in a very specific fashion.
15640450:14	This was highlighted in a series of photo-cross-linking experiments where short duplex DNA substrates were used to demonstrate that at a DNA terminus, Ku 80 is positioned more internally and Ku 70 is positioned closer to the terminus.
15640450:15	In addition, Ku 70 was observed to make specific contacts within the major groove in the DNA helix, while Ku 80 does not appear to contact the major groove but is oriented in proximity of the minor groove.
15640450:16	These results indicate that while Ku binding is not sequence specific, alterations in duplex structure could influence the DNA binding activity of Ku.
15640450:17	After Ku binds to a double-stranded DNA terminus, it recruits DNA-PKcs to the site of the break.
15640450:18	Electron crystallography at 22 Å resolution revealed an open channel in the DNA-PKcs structure that could interact with double-stranded DNA.
15640450:19	Studies show that on short DNA substrates, the association of DNA-PKcs causes Ku to move further along the length of the duplex DNA.
15640450:20	DNA-PKcs was demonstrated to make direct contact with approximately the first 10 bp along a duplex DNA substrate.
15640450:21	Electron micrographic studies also show that dramatic conformational changes accompany DNA-PKcs binding to DNA.
15640450:22	These conformational changes were postulated to be involved in activation of the kinase, which in turn could facilitate recruitment of other proteins involved in the repair process.
15640450:23	Considering that DNA-PKcs is maximally activated by double-stranded DNA containing un-annealed single-strand segments, how these substrates influence the DNA-PKcs conformational changes is of significant interest.
15640450:24	While much is known about the repair of single sites of DNA damage or strand breaks, considerably less is known concerning the repair of compound lesions on DNA.
15640450:25	One study has assessed the effect of terminal nucleotide modification on the activation of DNA-PK.
15640450:26	The results demonstrate that DNA-PK is largely unaffected by terminal base modification.
15640450:27	The presence of a cisplatin adduct in the vicinity of a DNA DSB represents a compound lesion potentially encountered by NHEJ proteins in cells treated with concurrent cisplatin and IR.
15640450:28	Cisplatin is a DNA damaging agent that forms DNA adducts preferentially at adjacent guanine bases in duplex DNA.
15640450:29	The effect of cisplatin lesions on Ku binding and DNA-PKcs activation has been studied, and results show that Ku has a similar binding affinity for cisplatin-damaged DNA as compared to a control DNA of identical sequence without the cisplatin adducts.
15640450:30	Cisplatin adducts on duplex DNA strands were also demonstrated to decrease Ku's ability to translocate along the DNA, away from the terminus to which it was originally bound.
15640450:31	Interestingly, despite Ku and DNA-PKcs binding, activation of DNA-PKcs kinase activity was significantly reduced on cisplatin-damaged DNA.
15640450:32	To further investigate the effect of compound lesions and the specificity of the DNA on the DNA/DNA-PK interaction, we prepared a series of modified DNA duplex substrates focusing on sequence bias and strand orientation.
15640450:33	These results are discussed with respect to Ku and DNA-PK structure and function, and NHEJ-catalyzed repair of DNA DSBs.
15640450:34	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
Ku and DNA-PKcs each have unique characteristics that contribute to their affinity for specific DNA substrates.
15640450:35	The co-crystal structure of Ku bound to a duplex DNA reveals that the DNA is completely encircled by the Ku subunits, while not making any specific base contacts.
15640450:36	Therefore, the specificity for different DNA substrates that we observe in kinase activation is largely dictated by the DNA-PKcs and how the DNA interacts with this subunit of the complex.
15640450:37	Our data suggest that the sequence or chemical make-up of the specific DNA strands can modulate the allosteric activation of DNA-PK.
15640450:38	Despite the structure-specific manner in which Ku binds DNA, with the Ku 70 subunit being positioned closer to the DNA end and the 80 subunit being positioned more internally, the sequence bias, polarity and position of cisplatin lesions have only a minimal effect on DNA binding.
15640450:39	Experiments show that DNA-PKcs possess a channel that can accommodate double-stranded DNA, and upon binding DNA, undergoes a fairly dramatic conformational change that folds around the DNA, almost completely encircling the duplex.
15640450:40	It is possible that specific structures either induce this change or accommodate the change better than others.
15640450:41	By using specific substrates with varying strand polarity and sequence bias, as well as biotin and cisplatin modifications, we have demonstrated that in reference to strand polarity, different DNA substrates with specific sequences can in fact result in differential activation of DNA-PK.
15640450:42	A model for DNA-PK activation and synapse activity in NHEJ was proposed based on in vitro analysis of kinase activation and electron microscopy of DNA–DNA-PKcs complexes.
15640450:43	Once DNA-PKcs has been recruited to the ends of DNA with a DSB, it binds to the terminus of both pieces of the broken DNA.
15640450:44	The double-stranded DNA protrudes through the kinase, and each frayed, single-stranded DNA end deviates further from the other.
15640450:45	The single-stranded ends were then postulated to insert into potentially two separate cavities or single-stranded DNA binding sites.
15640450:46	More recently, it has been shown that kinase activity is preferentially activated by three bases of single-stranded dT ends, but the preferred polarity of this nucleotide remains undefined.
15640450:47	Our data demonstrates that in terms of activating DNA-PKcs, the cavities prefer a 3′ pyrimidine-rich strand and a 5′ purine-rich strand.
15640450:48	A 3′ purine-rich strand and 5′ pyrimidine-rich strand can reside in the cavities, but results in reduced activity of DNA-PK, demonstrating that a 3′ pyrimidine-rich strand is optimal for kinase activation.
15640450:49	Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the discrimination for the single-stranded termini lies on the 3′ strand where a pyrimidine-rich sequence is preferred.
15640450:50	Our results, as well as those of Martensson et al ., are inconsistent with the discrimination being dictated by the 5′ strand.
15640450:51	Our results are also consistent with in vitro analyses measuring the ability of 3′ and 5′ single-strand DNA overhangs to activate DNA-PKcs in the absence of Ku, with a preference being shown for 3′ single-strand overhangs.
15640450:52	Considering the chemical structure of a pyrimidine is smaller than that of a purine base, it will be interesting to determine the degree to which chemical make-up and size of bases modulate DNA-PK activity.
15640450:53	The experiments we conducted revealed several differences in DNA that can result in an inactive DNA-PK complex.
15640450:54	Interestingly, the presence of a cisplatin–DNA adduct 6 bp from the terminus of a substrate results in significant inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity.
15640450:55	The cisplatin–DNA adduct results in a structural distortion in the DNA strand.
15640450:56	Specifically, cisplatin modification of a duplex DNA results in a structural distortion of the strand, with a 78° bend in the DNA and a 25° untwisting of the structure.
15640450:57	When the cisplatin adduct is in close proximity to an accessible end of DNA, over 80% inhibition of kinase activity compared to an undamaged control is observed.
15640450:58	The degree of inhibition caused by the cisplatin adduct, however, is strand independent in that cisplatin modification of both the 3′ or 5′ strand resulted in dramatic reduction in kinase activity.
15640450:59	Although the specific strand on which the cisplatin adduct resides does not affect kinase activity, the position of the cisplatin adduct with respect to the accessible terminus has a significant influence on the ability to activate DNA-PK.
15640450:60	These results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition may be a result of larger structural differences in the duplex that influence either binding, conformational changes or correct positioning of the termini in the 3′ cleft.
15640450:61	We propose that a cisplatin adduct positioned 6 bp from the terminus prevents the DNA from being fully threaded through the kinase, thus not allowing the single-stranded ends to wrap around and be placed in the activating cavities on DNA-PKcs.
15640450:62	Assuming the cisplatin modification 15 bp from the terminus also results in an inability to thread through DNA-PKcs, there is still sufficient DNA length from the modification to the end to result in the single-stranded termini to gain access to the cavities.
15640450:63	This model is consistent with other in vitro results demonstrating the requirement of 18 bp duplex DNA for successful binding of DNA-PKcs, and the ability of single-stranded DNA tails to activate the kinase.
15640450:64	Analysis of our results indicates that the degree of DNA-PK kinase activation is influenced by strand polarity, sequence bias and position of a cisplatin adduct.
15640450:65	These conclusions can aid in forming a more detailed outline of how Ku and DNA-PKcs play a role in NHEJ.
15640450:66	For example, in NHEJ-catalyzed repair of DNA double-strand breaks, DNA-PKcs binds to each DNA terminus to be joined, and once activated is thought to signal to other complexes involved in the repair process.
15640450:67	Electron microscopic and additional in vitro analyses suggests that the DNA-PK complexes can be in close proximity to each other and DNA-PKcs can serve to promote the association of two DNA termini.
15640450:68	Interestingly, this synaptic activity has also been attributed to Ku independent of DNA-PKcs.
15640450:69	Independent of the mechanism, following synapsis, alignment must occur with the correct polarity of each broken strand, so that the 5′ and 3′ ends of the strands will be ligated.
15640450:70	The presence of damage, like that associated with IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks, or having to search for regions of microhomology, may necessitate processing of the 5′ and 3′ termini.
15640450:71	Processing of the termini in NHEJ is potentially catalyzed by two nuclease activities with opposing directionalities.
15640450:72	The MRN complex is capable of 3′–5′ exonuclease activity and also contains an endonuclease activity capable of digesting a 3′ single-strand overhang.
15640450:73	Artemis contains an exonuclease activity capable of degrading DNA in the 5′–3′ direction.
15640450:74	The specific roles and substrate specificity of the MRN complex and Artemis in processing DNA termini have not been conclusively demonstrated.
15640450:75	Our data, demonstrating the importance of the 3′ strand of a duplex DNA, and published data, demonstrating the preference for a 3′ single-strand to activate DNA-PKcs suggests that the 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of Artemis may be responsible for generating a DNA structure capable of activating DNA-PK.
15640450:76	Our data demonstrate a clear preference for a pyrimidine 3′ terminus for DNA-PK activation.
15640450:77	This data suggests that either the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of MRN or the endonuclease activity of MRN could also generate a substrate capable of activating DNA-PK and hence support NHEJ-catalyzed repair of a DNA DSB.
15640450:78	Clearly, further investigation of how the chemical structure of the 3′ ends of a substrate influence the processing by MRN and Artemis, and activation of DNA-PK, is of great interest.
21249186:0	Introduction 
Biomedical full-text articles incorporate a significant number of figures with such figures typically reporting experimental results, presenting research models, and providing examples of biomedical objects (e.g., cells, tissue, and organs).
21249186:1	Figures represent important biomedical knowledge, and consequently figure mining has drawn much attention in the biomedical research community – . 
Most approaches to figure mining focus on extracting localization features from figures (e.g., ), figure classification and text-figure association – . For example, the Subcellular Location Image Finder (SLIF) system extracts information from fluorescence microscopy images and aligns image panels to their corresponding sub-legend.
21249186:2	Shatkay et al. integrated image features with text to enhance document classification.
21249186:3	BioText and Yale Image Finder index figure legends and return figure+legend in response to a text query.
21249186:4	We have also developed approaches for figure classification , as well as natural language processing approaches for associating figure with text figure summarization and figure ranking . 
Biomedical figure text, that is, text appearing in biomedical figures is important for understanding the meaning of figures.
21249186:5	However, few approaches have been developed for extracting text from figures.
21249186:6	shows representative examples of biomedical figure text, including biomedical named entities (e.g., tissue, species, chemical, and gene or protein names) and function descriptions (e.g., “DNA binding domain”).
21249186:7	Such examples show the potential value that figure text has for biomedical figure mining but also suggest some of the challenges of such work, which will be discussed below.
21249186:8	Existing work on text extraction from images has mainly focused on the open-domain of natural scene images , and videos – rather than biomedical figure text extraction.
21249186:9	Previous research has applied off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to figure retrieval and figure panel detection . Our own research has found that off-the-shelf OCR tools generally produce many recognition errors on biomedical figures; however, there is no published work on evaluating existing OCR tools for biomedical figures or improving the performance of such tools for biomedical work.
21249186:10	Thus, this study is the first attempt for both tasks.
21249186:11	Figures are images.
21249186:12	In the open domain, image text extraction is a relatively mature field and typically incorporates the following three steps: text localization character recognition and text correction . Open-domain off-the-shelf OCR tools can perform well under two conditions – that images are of high quality and that text is typically presented with a simple background.
21249186:13	Unfortunately, both of these conditions are seldom met by biomedical figures; rather, we have observed that biomedical figures are frequently of low image quality and that the background of images tends to be complex.
21249186:14	Furthermore, biomedical figures have domain-specific characteristics that include unexpected word boundaries (e.g., hyphens and other punctuation), domain-specific terms (e.g., gene and protein names), and symbols that do not appear in open-domain images.
21249186:15	Therefore, we speculate that off-the-shelf OCR tools may not perform well on biomedical figures.
21249186:16	In this study, we first evaluated the performance of an off-the-shelf OCR tool.
21249186:17	We then developed and evaluated a novel and domain-specific biomedical Figure Text Extraction Tool (FigTExT) for extracting text from biomedical figures.
21249186:18	Thus, our study is an important step towards biomedical full-text mining.
21249186:19	Methods 
As shown in FigTExT has three components: image preprocessing character recognition and text correction . Image preprocessing enhances not only text region detection by improving image contrast and determining the gray level of figure texts, but also image quality by up-sampling.
21249186:20	FigTExT adapts an off-the-shelf OCR tool on the improved text localization for character recognition . For text correction FigTExT first corrects misrecognized characters using a figure-specific lexicon and then refines the corrected result to filter out some spurious corrections.
21249186:21	Results 
Discussion 
Although the off-the-shelf OCR tool attained 97% accuracy in character recognition for high-quality document images, our results (as shown in ) show that it performed poorly (25.3% F1-score) on biomedical figures.
21249186:22	Therefore, it is important to develop a recognition tool specifically for biomedical figure text.
21249186:23	Our FigTExT was built by implementing components for image preprocessing, character recognition, and text correction.
21249186:24	Below, we will discuss each component.
19772601:0	Background 
Ring chromosome 22 [r(22)] is a rare human constitutional abnormality.
19772601:1	A distinct characteristic phenotype has not been delineated, but frequently reported features are delayed motor development, severe speech disability, hypotonia and microcephaly.
19772601:2	In addition growth retardation, ataxia and seizures or abnormal EEG can be observed.
19772601:3	Dysmorphic features are variable and mostly mild.
19772601:4	Epicanthal folds, full eyebrows and large ears have been reported most frequently [ - ].
19772601:5	Aggressive behaviour as well as autistic disorder and hyperactivity are relatively common [ , ].
19772601:6	Internal organ involvement is rather rare, except for central nervous system malformations . The variable clinical presentation in carriers of a r(22) has been attributed to variable breakpoints and dynamic mosaicism.
19772601:7	In common with other ring chromosomes, r(22) is assumed to arise from breakage and subsequent fusion of both chromosome arms with concomitant loss of sequences distal to the breakpoints . Whereas deletion of ribosomal sequences on 22p is unlikely to be of clinical significance, loss of critical genes on 22q as well as unmasking of recessive alleles by the deletion may be expected to contribute to the phenotype.
19772601:8	In a large review of 35 reported cases 22q loss varied from less than 69 kb up to 10.2 Mb in size with a weak correlation between the phenotypic variables and deletion size . The phenotype can further be affected by the continuously evolving mosaicism (dynamic mosaicism) that is caused by the mitotic instability of the ring chromosome.
19772601:9	Sister chromatid exchanges during mitosis can lead to formation of dicentric or interlocked rings and subsequent aneuploidy or rearrangements within the chromosome . 
Clinical features compatible with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2) have been associated with r(22) [ - ].
19772601:10	Reported features included hearing loss, mental retardation, seizures, meningiomas, peripheral neurofibromas, peripheral schwannomas, spinal tumours and vestibular schwannomas.
19772601:11	In most reported cases the tumoural phenotype is most suggestive of NF2.
19772601:12	We report on a patient with a r(22) and signs of neurofibromatosis who presented with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma at the age of 20.
19772601:13	In DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes the 22q deletion size was examined by array CGH analysis.
19772601:14	Analysis of tumour tissue showed loss of the ring 22 and in addition a pathogenic NF2 mutation.
19772601:15	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
This is the first report describing the complete pathogenic sequence of tumour formation in a patient with r(22) with loss of the ring chromosome in the tumour tissue and a second hit in the NF2 gene on the remaining chromosome 22.
19772601:16	The karyotype and array CGH showed that the ring chromosome 22 was lost in the vestibular schwannoma.
19772601:17	In addition NF2 mutation analysis on the tumour tissue showed a somatic splice-site mutation on the remaining chromosome 22.
19772601:18	Predisposition for vestibular schwannomas in carriers of r(22) can be explained by Knudson's two-hit model.
19772601:19	Due to the mitotic instability the ring chromosome is prone to loss during somatic mitosis (first hit).
19772601:20	A mutation at the NF2 gene on the remaining chromosome 22 (second hit) in cells that have become monosomic for this chromosome can result in tumour development.
19772601:21	This mechanism was also suspected by Tsilchorozidou in a patient with r(22) presenting with multiple meningiomas and a unilateral vestibular schwannoma.
19772601:22	They found two truncating mutations in meningioma tissue as well as loss of one copy of the NF2 gene by LOH analysis . However they did not prove loss of the ring chromosome in the tumour tissue.
19772601:23	Interestingly increased tumour development has also been observed in carriers of other constitutional ring chromosomes, i.e. r(11) and r(13).
19772601:24	Moreover the types of malignancy reported in these patients are concordant with the chromosomal assignment of tumour suppressor loci associated with Wilms' tumour (chromosome 11) and retinoblastoma (chromosome 13).
19772601:25	INI1 is a tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 22 centromeric to NF2 .
19772601:26	It is involved in the development of malignant rhabdoid tumours and germline INI1 mutations are present in some cases of familial schwannomatosis, a condition characterized by the development of multiple spinal, peripheral and cranial-nerve schwannomas in the absence of vestibular schwannomas .
19772601:27	It is possible that still other tumour suppressor genes are located on chromosome 22 . Moreover the CHEK2 gene, which encodes a checkpoint kinase important for the cell's response to DNA damage, has been recognized as a multi-organ cancer susceptibility gene and is located on chromosome 22 about 1 Mb centromeric to NF2 . Thus a second hit in these alternative tumour suppressor genes in r(22) carriers that already have lost the ring in a number of cells can result in other tumour types than those typically seen in NF2.
19772601:28	Indeed there have been reports of r(22) carriers with development of multiple meningiomas, cutaneous tumours and one testicular tumour but without the typical bilateral vestibular schwannomas of NF2 [ , ].
19772601:29	The patient reported here had been initially followed with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 because of multiple café-au-lait macules, freckling, a mildly enlarged right optic nerve and several subcutaneous nodules resembling neurofibromas.
19772601:30	However these clinical features do not point to a true NF1 phenotype.
19772601:31	Skin pigmentation abnormalities have been reported in patients with r(22)  and café-au-lait macules have been associated with multiple ring chromosomes (7, 11, 12, 15, 17) [ - ].
19772601:32	In view of the r(22) abnormality we believe that the enlargement of the right optic nerve could be due to a meningioma rather than to an optic glioma.
19772601:33	Conclusion 
We conclude that tumours can arise by the combination of loss of the ring chromosome and a pathogenic NF2 mutation on the remaining chromosome 22 in patients with r(22).
19772601:34	Our findings indicate that patients with a ring 22 should be monitored for NF2-related tumours starting in adolescence.

18162707:0	INTRODUCTION 
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of human mortality and a worldwide public health problem.
18162707:1	There are large discrepancies in the rates of TB infection between countries in each major region and among different locations and demographic groups within each country.
18162707:2	Local and regional increases in the incidence of TB have occurred because of limited health care resources and societal disruptions.
18162707:3	North Korea's economic and public health problems began in the early 1990s as a result of the gradual loss of economic support from its communist allies, combined with an inordinate number of natural disasters.
18162707:4	This public health tragedy has increased the development of active TB in North Korea; 11,050 cases were reported in 1997 and this increased to 41,810 in 2003 (184 per 100,000 of the population).
18162707:5	Dislocated North Koreans have been identified entering the Republic of Korea since 1954; the number increased from 60 in 1999 to 1,364 in 2005.
18162707:6	Such individuals may carry a significant infectious disease burden as a result of the prevalence of disease in their country of origin, exposure during migration, adverse conditions during migration such as poor nutrition, and exposure to multiple psychological and physical stress.
18162707:7	Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI), morbidity, drug resistance, and Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) coverage among dislocated North Koreans settled in the Republic of Korea.
18162707:8	Our aim is to initiate a specific control programme and to plan for the impact of this disease.
18162707:9	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
Since being liberated from Japanese rule in 1945, the Republic of Korea has achieved remarkable economic growth under democracy and a market economy.
18162707:10	On the other hand, North Korea has maintained a socialist system and has suffered from economic crisis since the 1990s.
18162707:11	Economic status not only directly influences the health level, but also indirectly affects it through influences on nutrition, hygiene, health resources, and other intervening factors.
18162707:12	During the peak years for public health in North Korea in 1980, the North Korean government claimed that active TB had been "eradicated" in the country.
18162707:13	However, since the public health crisis in North Korea after 1995, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of smear- and/or culture-positive TB.
18162707:14	The abrupt decline in the presence rate of BCG vaccination scar among refugees younger than 30 yr in our study (56.6%) presumably reflects this decay in the North Korean health system.
18162707:15	In North Korea, 11,050 cases of active TB were notified in 1997 and this increased to 41,810 in 2003 (184 cases per 100,000 population).
18162707:16	This was higher than in the Republic of Korea during the same period (33,888; 71 cases per 100,000 population).
18162707:17	Today, TB remains one of the most serious public health problems in North Korea.
18162707:18	By contrast, the government of the Republic of Korea has concentrated its limited resources for public health activities on TB control programmes, whereas the private sector has taken charge of constructing the health delivery system, including health facilities and human resources.
18162707:19	The Republic of Korea has performed nationwide active TB prevalence surveys at five-yearly intervals from 1965 to 1995, and the results of the last (the seventh) survey have been reported.
18162707:20	Over the past 30 yr the prevalence of direct smear-positive individuals has reduced from 683 to 93 per 100,000; that of smear- and/or culture-positive individuals has reduced from 940 to 219 per 100,000 and the prevalence of active TB has gone down from 5,065 to 1,032 per 100,000.
18162707:21	Since 1954, 8,313 North Korean refugees have entered Republic of Korea; 7,722 have entered since 1999 because of the economic crisis.
18162707:22	Dislocated North Koreans may carry active TB and LTBI as a result of economic and cultural changes and psychological and environmental stresses.
18162707:23	In this study, the prevalence of active TB was 1,127 per 100,000 in dislocated North Koreans, which is higher than that of the Republic of Korea in 1995 (1,032 per 100,000; PR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02-1.61).
18162707:24	When persons migrate from such nations with poor health care, they often carry LTBI that may reactivate after arrival in the host country.
18162707:25	The prevalence of LTBI among dislocated North Koreans aged under 30 years without a BCG scar was 62.3%, much higher than that of the Republic of Korea; 15.5% in 1995 (PR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.12-1.60).
18162707:26	Because of the remarkable decline in the incidence of active TB in the Republic of Korea after 1995, the overall PR has been higher recently.
18162707:27	Therefore, interventions that target recent dislocated North Koreans can contribute both to the health of those individuals and to overall TB control in the Republic of Korea.
18162707:28	The risk of progression to active TB is greatest soon after arrival; approximately half the active TB cases among immigrants from endemic countries occur during the first five years after immigration.
18162707:29	Among these dislocated North Koreans, 38 newly active TB cases were diagnosed during the first years after entry into the Republic of Korea, and specialized re-screening programmes for dislocated North Koreans are required.
18162707:30	Outbreaks due to multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have occurred in a number of locations, often associated with breakdowns in health care infrastructures.
18162707:31	Because of the higher rate of previous treatments for active TB, immigration has been suggested as one factor leading to the increased prevalence of MDR-TB.
18162707:32	In our study, although DST was performed for only 13 isolates, 69% of these were resistant to at least one drug in vitro and 23% were MDR; higher than those of the Republic of Korea (12.3% and 2.4%, respectively).
18162707:33	Rates of drug resistance among immigrant populations reflect the rates in the countries of origin, which are significantly higher in many developing countries than in developed countries.
18162707:34	Incomplete and inadequate treatment is the most important factor leading to its development, suggesting that it is often a man-made tragedy.
18162707:35	The high prevalence of MDR-TB among dislocated North Koreans thus reflects the poor infrastructure of the health care system of North Korea.
18162707:36	TB has always been associated with social stigma.
18162707:37	Because refugees from North Korea are also at risk of discrimination, the stigma attached to active TB may raise formidable barriers to effective healthcare.
18162707:38	Dislocated North Koreans may avoid seeking care for active TB, because of a fear that they will experience discrimination or isolation if they are associated with this contagious illness.
18162707:39	The responses of medical providers, whether leaning toward xenophobia or compassion, will have major impacts on societal responses to dislocated North Koreans with active TB.
18162707:40	The increased case of international travel has led to increasing recognition that infectious diseases have no borders.
18162707:41	This is the first report on the extent of active TB and LTBI in dislocated North Koreans settled in the Republic of Korea.
18162707:42	However, there are limitations in our findings.
18162707:43	Fewer than 40% of active TB cases were confirmed microbiologically, and few had DST results.
18162707:44	The fact that anti-TB medication was initiated after pre-departure screening for active TB among 13 (15%) of the dislocated North Koreans with active TB might explain the lower rate of bacteriologic confirmation of the disease.
18162707:45	In conclusion, our results have documented the prevalence of active and LTBI among dislocated North Koreans.
18162707:46	These people bear a disproportionate burden of infectious disease because of the circumstances under which they have migrated to the Republic of Korea.
18162707:47	We need to initiate a specific control programme and to plan for the impact and control of TB in the Republic of Korea.
18162707:48	In parallel with our efforts to improve the living standards of North Koreans and our consistent pursuit of a policy of reconciliation and cooperation towards the North, we are also trying to reduce or eliminate the causes for their exodus.
21423649:0	Introduction 
Removing the germ line of Caenorhabditis elegans extends its lifespan by approximately 60% . Eliminating germ cells also increases the lifespan of Drosophila suggesting that a conserved mechanism links the germ line to longevity . In C. elegans removal of the germ line can be achieved either by laser ablation of germline precursor cells at early developmental stages or through mutations that impair the proliferation of germline stem cells (GSCs) . The glp-1(e2141ts) and mes-1(bn7) alleles deplete the germ line by either blocking proliferative signals for GSC or inhibiting cell division in the P lineage at early embryonic stages.
21423649:1	As a result, animals carrying these alleles are long-lived . Longevity is not merely caused by sterility because animals lacking both germ cells and the somatic gonad are sterile but not long lived.
21423649:2	The germ line and the somatic gonad have been suggested to have opposite effects on longevity but the molecular basis of germline-mediated longevity remains poorly understood.
21423649:3	Hsin and Kenyon showed that the presence of daf-16/FOXO or daf-12/VDR is required for extending the lifespan of animals whose germ line had been ablated . DAF-16/FOXO is a forkhead transcription factor that translocates into intestinal nuclei and promotes transcription when GSCs stop proliferating . daf-16/FOXO is a key downstream component of the insulin/IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway that also regulates longevity .
21423649:4	Although inhibiting GSC proliferation and down-regulating the activity of the IIS pathway both result in lifespan extension and translocation of DAF-16 into intestinal nuclei, several experiments show that these manipulations are not equivalent.
21423649:5	First, GSC removal extends the lifespan of daf-2 mutants that are already long-lived due to a constitutively down-regulated IIS pathway (hypomorphic allele of the sole insulin receptor) . Nuclear translocation of DAF-16 requires the intestinal protein KRI-1 (an ankyrin-repeat protein) when it is provoked by a GSC proliferation arrest, but not by daf-2 mutations .
21423649:6	Finally, the transcription elongation factor, TCER-1, promotes the transcriptional activity of daf-16/FOXO when GSCs stop dividing but not in long-lived IIS mutants . Taken together, these data indicate that IIS and GSCs affect longevity though distinct mechanisms although they are both mediated by DAF-16.
21423649:7	The second pathway required for germline longevity is the DAF-12 lipophilic-hormone signaling pathway.
21423649:8	In response to the loss of germ cells, the cytochrome P450, DAF-9 and the Rieske protein, DAF-36 use cholesterol to produce a steroid hormone (dafachronic acids) that activates the nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12/VDR . DAF-12/VDR is homologous to the vertebrate vitamin D receptor, and its presence in its activated form is required to extend lifespan though depletion of the germ line .
21423649:9	The interactions of KRI-1/DAF-16/TCER-1 and the DAF-9/DAF-36/DAF-12 pathways are still unclear.
21423649:10	Similar to KRI-1, DAF-9 and DAF-12 facilitate the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 triggered by germline removal suggesting that the lipophilic-hormone signaling pathway may act upstream of DAF-16.
21423649:11	However, recent work showed that DAF-12 and DAF-16 also function separately.
21423649:12	First, germline-less animals in which DAF-16 is forced into intestinal nuclei still require daf-12 to be long-lived . Second DAF-12 and DAF-16 promote the expression of different gene sets . The Kenyon lab showed that sod-3 and cdr-6 are DAF-16 and DAF-12 targets, respectively . The K04A8.5 lipase is induced in glp-1(e2141ts) mutant animals in a daf-16 dependent manner but is not affected by daf-12 .
21423649:13	Since the K04A8.5 lipase is also required for lifespan extension, these results suggest that the KRI-1/DAF-16/K04A8.5 pathway can promote longevity independently of daf-12 and that DAF-16 dependent transcription does not strictly require daf-12 .
21423649:14	Finally, it has also been shown that the DAF-12 lipophilic-hormone signaling pathway can mediate longevity in response to the somatic reproductive tissues, but this also requires the presence of DAF-16 . Thus, it is still unclear whether DAF-12 can promote longevity in the absence of daf-16 . 
In the present study, we searched for new nuclear receptors that can mediate longevity of C. elegans through depletion of the germ line using an RNAi-based genetic screen.
21423649:15	We report that nhr-80/HNF4 is required for extending lifespan through germline removal, although it does not affect the lifespan of wild type animals.
21423649:16	We show that NHR-80 is specific to this pathway since other longevity paradigms are not affected by a loss-of-function mutation of nhr-80 .
21423649:17	Moreover, the levels of NHR-80 increase in intestinal cells when germ cells are depleted.
21423649:18	This increase is physiologically relevant because (1) overexpressing nhr-80 further extends the lifespan of germline-less animals and (2) germline ablation leads to the nhr-80 dependent up-regulation of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fat-6 that produces oleic acid (OA) from stearic acid and (3) increased fatty acid desaturation and OA production are necessary to extend the lifespan of germline-less animals.
21423649:19	A link between fat metabolism and germline-mediated longevity has already been reported by the Ruvkun lab.
21423649:20	In this recent report, the authors reported that the triacylglyceride (TAG) lipase ( K04A8.5 ) is required for germline longevity . Both fat-6 and K04A8.5 are induced in germline-less animals, and their inactivation by RNAi fully suppresses lifespan extension by depletion of the germ line.
21423649:21	However, in contrast to the K04A8.5 lipase that acts downstream of the KRI-1/DAF-16 pathway and independently of the DAF-9/DAF-36/DAF-12 lipophilic-hormone signaling pathway, we show that the NHR-80/FAT-6/OA pathway does not require the presence of daf-16 but necessitates the presence of daf-12 . Taken together, our data and that of Wang et al. are consistent with the conclusion that the lifespan benefits triggered by inhibiting GSC proliferation require a important modification of the metabolism of fat since the NHR-80/FAT-6/OA and the KRI-1/DAF-16/K04A8.4
21423649:22	pathways are activated independently to promote longevity though the activation of fat remodeling enzymes.
21423649:23	Results 
Discussion 
In the present study, we show that, when germ cells are removed, nhr-80 mRNA and protein levels increase.
21423649:24	This promotes the mono-desaturation of stearic acid to OA by inducing the transcription of the stearoyl-CoA-desaturase, fat-6/SCD1 .
21423649:25	This cascade is physiologically relevant to longevity since both nhr-80 and the SCD activity are required to augment the lifespan of germline-depleted animals.
21423649:26	Furthermore, the lack of SCD activity can be bypassed by addition of exogenous OA in the medium, confirming the pivotal role of this metabolite.
21423649:27	Our data also indicate that the FAT-6/OA branch is required, but not sufficient, to promote longevity in response to depletion of the germ line downstream of NHR-80.
21423649:28	This is evidenced by the fact that overexpressing nhr-80 extends the lifespan of both glp-1(e2141ts) and daf-16(mu86);glp-1(e2141ts) mutants but OA does not, suggesting that these two interventions are not equivalent ( , 13A, ).
21423649:29	Supporting this view, we showed that OA and NHR-80 must act in concert to support the lifespan extension conferred by germ cell loss.
21423649:30	Indeed, OA does not increase the lifespan of glp-1(e2141ts);nhr-80(tm1011) mutants and overexpressing nhr-80 is inefficient when the SCD genes are deleted (OA producing genes).
21423649:31	Moreover, while OA restores the lifespan of glp-1(e2141ts);fat-6(tm331);fat-7(wa36) mutant animals, it essentially fails to do so when nhr-80 is deactivated by RNAi.
21423649:32	Thus, our data support the notion that the OA production pathway is not the only longevity-promoting branch downstream of NHR-80.
21423649:33	Finding other lifespan promoting NHR-80 targets will be an important goal in the future.
21423649:34	Our data are also compatible with the non-exclusive hypothesis that OA may act as a NHR-80 ligand.
21423649:35	Although we do not provide biochemical evidence for this interaction in C. elegans several articles have shown that long chain free fatty acids act as a ligand for the NHR-80 homolog in Drosophila and mammals, HNF4 – .
21423649:36	It will be interesting to critically test this possibility in the future by either performing structural studies or transactivation assays to test the binding of OA to the NHR-80 ligand binding domain.
19242540:0	Introduction 
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia in man in developed countries.
19242540:1	Death from prostate cancer occurs largely in patients with the aggressive androgen-insensitive metastatic disease.
19242540:2	A number of studies have recently demonstrated that a prominent role in tumor survival and progression can be attributed to soluble mediators present in the tumor microenvironment.
19242540:3	Among these, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a fundamental role in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and differentiation in many cell types and it is also implicated in the development and progression of several forms of tumours including that of the prostate . In fact, the expression of IL-6 and its receptor is consistently demonstrated in human prostate cancer cell lines and in freshly isolated cells from human prostate carcinoma and benign prostate hyperplasia . Clinically, the levels of IL-6 in serum are significantly elevated in many men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Further, IL-6 activates androgen receptor-mediated gene expression in LNCaP cells in vitro , suggesting that IL-6 may play a critical role during the progression of prostate cancer.
19242540:4	In addition, over-expression of IL-6 in androgen-responsive LNCaP cells promotes their androgen-independent growth in vitro and in vivo . Recently, the chemochine CCL5 (RANTES) was found to be expressed by human prostate carcinoma cells and reported to stimulate their proliferation and invasion . Thus, also CCL5 appears to be directly involved in the behaviour of prostate carcinoma cells.
19242540:5	The gene expression of both IL-6 and CCL5 is mainly regulated at a transcriptional level, by the cooperative activity of NF-κB transcription factor with members of at least five different families of transactivators including AP-1 . Noticeably, the cooperation between NF-κB and AP-1 appears to be essential for the constitutive deregulated production of IL-6 observed in the androgen-independent, aggressive prostate cancer cells . Gene induction occurs depending on the ability of a variety of cell surface receptors to activate distinct and/or partially overlapping intracellular signalling pathways eventually targeting the phosphorylation site(s) of one or more MAP kinases (i.e. p38, ERK1/2, JUNK) committed in turn to activate IL-6 and/or CCL5 gene transactivators.
19242540:6	Cytokines, growth factors receptors, adhesion molecules and many other membrane-generated signals all share the ability to efficiently promote IL-6 or CCL5 gene expression and consequently also their downstream effects.
19242540:7	In addition, under long-term treatment conditions, IL-6 can activate its own gene expression and, in prostate cancer, autocrine and paracrine loops involving IL-6 and one of its multiple activators, the TGF-beta, have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and neuroendocrine differentiation .
19242540:8	The expression levels of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been proposed as a useful indicator of the severity of the disease in prostate cancer – . PSMA is a type-II integral membrane protein, predominantly localized to the epithelial cells of the prostate gland and endowed with folate-hydrolase and carboxypeptidase activity . Its low expression in normal prostate epithelial cells increases several fold in high-grade prostate cancers, in metastatic and in androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma . These features have made it emerging as one of the most promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer . The clinical observations suggesting a possible correlation between high levels of IL-6 production and PSMA expression in high-grade prostate cancer prompted us to investigate whether a functional relationship may exist between the presence of PSMA at the cell surface and the level of gene expression of IL-6.
19242540:9	CCL5 was also investigated because it shares with IL-6 the mechanism of gene induction and the pro-proliferative activity.
19242540:10	The hypothesis that PSMA belonged to the ever increasing category of molecules endowed with signalling properties was also suggested by previous observations showing that silencing, inhibiting or knocking-down PSMA modulates the adhesion/de-adhesion processes via activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in LNCaP cells or via activation of p21-activated kinase1 (PAK1) in normal endothelial cells (HUVEC) . Unlike what previously done by others , we decided to stimulate rather than to inhibit or silence PSMA at the surface of LNCaP cells and to overcome the lack of defined PSMA ligand(s) by cross-linking the extra-cellular domain of the molecule with specific antibodies.
19242540:11	Here, by using the androgen-independent LNCaP cell line, we present for the first time evidence that the antibody-mediated aggregation of PSMA greatly induce the basal gene expression of both IL-6 and CCL5 in LNCaP cells.
19242540:12	Gene induction occurs due to an activation cascade involving RAS, RAC1, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs, leading to the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB transcription factor.
19242540:13	In addition, we demonstrate that both IL-6 and CCL5 promote the proliferation of LNCaP tumour cells reaching their maximal activity synergistically.
19242540:14	Moreover, we present a novel finding related to the ability of CCL5 to induced proliferation in LNCaP cells thank to the activation of STAT5 and the consequent increase of expression of cyclin D1, a pathway controlling cell growth in normal and prostate cancer cells.
19242540:15	This newly discovered functions of PSMA implicate this molecule as an important regulator of the prostate tumour cell growth.
19242540:16	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In this paper we show for the first time that the tumor biomarker PSMA, a multi-functional cell surface ectopeptidase is endowed with an efficient signaling activity in prostate cancer cells.
19242540:17	PSMA recruitment at the surface of LNCaP cells elicits a signaling wave involving small GTPases RAS, RAC1, and MAPK p38 and ERK1/2 activation.
19242540:18	Consistent with the p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the NF-κB transcription factor was also activated following PSMA stimulation and the minimal basal level of both IL-6 and CCL5 production was increased two-three fold.
19242540:19	The discrete role of PSMA-mediated activation of p38 and ERK1/2 was examined under loss-of-function conditions secured by the blocking activity of kinase-specific chemical inhibitors, used at concentrations not affecting the adhesion of LNCaP cells nor the expression of PSMA at their surface (not shown).
19242540:20	In this setting, p38 kinase exerted a wider and greater activity than ERK1/2 on both the basal and the PSMA-induced expression of IL-6 and CCL5.
19242540:21	A possible explanation of the greater function of p38 may reside in the different roles played by p38 and ERK1/2 in the activation of NF-κB and NF-IL6, major transactivators of both IL-6 and CCL5 promoters . We have previously reported that in normal human thymic epithelial cells p38 MAPK induced the post-transcriptional activation of both NF-κB and NF-IL6, whereas ERK1/2 was involved in the activation of NF-κB only.
19242540:22	Consistent with the dual activity of p38, its inhibition with SB202190 almost abrogated the cytokine production, whereas ERK1/2 inhibition with PD98059 resulted in a lesser effect . The distinct functions of the two MAPKs may well be reproduced also in prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by our results with the inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190, thus suggesting that also in LNCaP cells p38 MAPK exerts a wider role than ERK1/2 on IL-6 and CCL5 transcription factors.
19242540:23	The membrane proximal events leading to RAS and RAC1 activation following PSMA recruitment have not been studied yet and full elucidation of these aspects will require further investigations.
19242540:24	Irrespective of the composition of the signaling platform used by PSMA in transducing external stimuli, our results provide evidence that PMSA can regulate the gene expression of IL-6 and CCL5 in the same LNCaP cells.
19242540:25	These results were obtained following direct stimulation of the molecule under “in vitro” conditions closely resembling a physiological setting and without substantial cell manipulations.
19242540:26	In addition, because biochemical studies and functional assays were performed with cell lysates and cell supernatants obtained from the same cell cultures, these results directly demonstrated that PSMA-elicited signals flowed efficiently from the membrane to the nucleus.
19242540:27	The amount of IL-6 and CCL5 released in culture by the LNCaP cell line may appear lower than that produced by other cell lines.
19242540:28	However, it has to be considered that a low concentration measured in cell supernatants can be dramatically high for a portion of the cell membrane and that the LNCaP cell line used by us represents only one of the multiple clones composing the prostate cancer cell population, thus emphasizing the importance that the synergic activity of IL-6 and CCL5 on LNCaP cells proliferation described by us may have in an “vivo” microenvironment.
19242540:29	IL-6 has yielded conflicting results in prostate tumor cell lines including LNCaP.
19242540:30	Cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic activity as well as growth arrest and neuroendocrine differentiation were all observed following treatment with IL-6 “in vitro” . By contrast, the notion that the level of IL-6 and its receptor increase during prostate carcinogenesis “in vivo” is still unchallenged, so that IL-6 is nowadays considered a good candidate for targeted therapy in prostate cancer . Differences in the cellular and experimental systems employed together with the complexity of the signaling pathway elicited by cytokines may possibly explain the divergence between the clinical and the “in vitro” experimental evidence.
19242540:31	Little is known about CCL5-CCR5 interaction in LNCaP cells, apart from the pro-proliferative activity previously reported by G.
19242540:32	Vaday et al. and confirmed also in the present paper.
19242540:33	The novel finding presented herein is the ability of CCL5 to activate STAT 5 thereby regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and ultimately controlling the LNCaP cell cycle progression.
19242540:34	Overall, it appears that PSMA signaling may be involved at multiple stages of the LNCaP cell deregulation and possibly also of in vivo tumorigenesis, because 1) increased ERK1/2 activation correlates with increasing Gleason score and advanced tumor stage and 2) increased activation of STAT 5 has been observed “in vivo” in 65% of human prostate cancers, being associated with high histological grade and being a predictor of early disease recurrence , .
19242540:35	Moreover, STAT 5 inhibition induces cell death in human prostate cancer cells .
19242540:36	It could be hypothesized that following stimulation via PSMA the prostate tumor cells augment IL-6 and CCL5 production which are in turn used as growth factors in both autocrine and paracrine manner, triggering a cell proliferation/survival loop conferring resistance to apoptosis and an overall definite advantage to tumor cell populations.
19242540:37	Within this context, the ability of PSMA to activate RAC1 may be highly relevant, inasmuch as RAC1 activation decreases the expression of E-cadherins thereby loosening intercellular adhesions and facilitating the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for mitosis . If so, activated RAC1 could therefore favor the response of LNCaP cells to the mitogenic activity of IL-6 and CCL5 meanwhile participating to the induction of their expression.
19242540:38	These events may have a direct bearing also on tumor cell proliferation and survival “in vivo”.
19242540:39	The prostate gland is composed mainly of stromal, epithelial, and neuroendocrine cells.
19242540:40	The dynamic balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis maintains the cellular and tissue homeostasis.
19242540:41	This balance is generated by a continuous cross-talk among these cell populations resulting from cell-cell contacts and the release of growth factors, chemokines and neuropeptides acting in a paracrine and autocrine manner . Deregulation in this communication circuit may contribute to the derangement of one or more tissue component(s) of the prostate gland, possibly resulting in benign prostate hyperplasia or prostate carcinoma.

null:0	Background 
IL-15 is involved in all phases of rheumatoid arthritis.
null:1	Recently we have shown that rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) express both IL-15 and functional IL-15 receptor . 
Objective 
The aim of present study was to identify pathways that are regulated by autocrine IL-15 (IL-15R) in RASF.
null:2	Methods 
RASF were transfected with plasmid encoding IL-15R antagonist (CRB-15, Cardion AG) or control constructs.
null:3	RNA from transient transfectants were used for Microarray analysis.
null:4	The differential expression of genes obtained by microarray analysis was verified by SYBR Green real-time PCR.
null:5	The expression of IL-15Rα, cell proliferation and the expression of p16 and p21 were evaluated in stably transfected cells.
null:6	Results 
The IL-15R antagonist produced by transfected RASF blocked the endogenous IL-15/IL-15Rα interaction, which resulted in an inhibition of cell proliferation (45 ± 10%) via an increase of the expression of p16.
null:7	In addition, we found that inhibition of IL-15Rα induced the expression of mRNA for FGFR-3.
null:8	Since two isoforms of FGFR-3 have been identified (FGFR-3b and FGFR-3c) , we tested the effect of IL-15Rα inhibition on their expression.
null:9	In contrast to FGFR-3b, the level of mRNA for FGFR-3c was strongly increased in cells transfected with the IL-15R antagonist (4.71 ± 2.5 in transient transfectants and 6.1 ± 1 fold in stable transfectants).
null:10	FGFR-3c isoform binds specifically FGF-9, but also FGF-2 . Besides FGFR-3, FGF-2 that is abundant in RA joints binds to FGFR-1.
null:11	In vitro studies revealed that FGFR-1 transmits a potent mitogenic signal, whereas FGFR-3 usually has no stimulatory effect or inhibits cell proliferation.
null:12	In contrast to FGFR-3c, blocking of IL-15Rα did not change the mRNA expression for FGFR-1 in RASF.
null:13	Moreover, we checked whether FGF-2 affects the expression of IL-15Rα.
null:14	Indeed, FGF-2 strongly decreased the spontaneous and tumor necrosis factor alpha-triggered expression of IL-15Rα at the mRNA and protein levels.
null:15	Conclusion 
Our findings raise the possibility of a negative loop between FGF-2/FGFR-3c and IL-15/IL-15R signaling in RASF.
null:16	Moreover, the activation of RASF by FGFs could depend on the ratio of FGFR-1/FGFR-3 expression, which is controlled by the endogenous IL-15/IL-15R system.
19574702:0	Case Report 
A 40-year-old male patient was referred for scleral ulceration following vitreoretinal surgery.
19574702:1	He had a previous history of laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes.
19574702:2	Patient had a well-controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
19574702:3	He had a previous history of a diabetic foot problem.
19574702:4	No other known systemic problems were present.
19574702:5	The patient had undergone right eye vitrectomy with silicone oil injection for a complicated diabetic retinal detachment.
19574702:6	No scleral buckling was done.
19574702:7	His postoperative course was uneventful in the first two weeks.
19574702:8	On his follow-up visit at three weeks, scleral ulceration was noted and he was referred for further management.
19574702:9	On presentation, right eye had a vision of finger counting at one meter with accurate projection.
19574702:10	Lids were normal, cornea was clear with few punctate erosions and a wide area of scleral ulceration was noted from 5 to 10'O clock position around the limbus . The base of the ulcer showed grey-white scleral necrosis with ischemic base but with no uveal show or purulent discharge.
19574702:11	Sclerotomy site with a vicryl suture was visible.
19574702:12	The conjunctiva over the ulcer was ulcerated and absent.
19574702:13	The area around the ulcer showed conjunctival congestion but there was no evidence of scleral inflammation (deep congestion, with scleral thickening and edema in a diffuse or nodular pattern), or nodule formation.
19574702:14	Anterior chamber was quiet, pupil was round and lens was clear.
19574702:15	Fundus evaluation showed attached retina.
19574702:16	The patient was started on oral doxycycline 100 mg/day, carboxymethylcellulose drops 0.5% hourly and moxifloxacin 0.5% eye drops four times a day.
19574702:17	Scrapings from the ulcer bed were subjected to smears and cultures but did not reveal any organisms.
19574702:18	Gram's, KOH, calcoflour and acid-fast staining were used for evaluation of smears.
19574702:19	Blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey's agar, brain heart infusion medium, Sabaroud's dextrose agar without cycloheximide were directly inoculated in the clinic and sent to the microbiology laboratory.
19574702:20	Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, complete blood counts with Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, Chest X-ray, blood sugars, liver function tests and serum creatinine were done under the guidance of a rheumatologist.
19574702:21	These were done to detect collagen vascular disease and as baseline tests in case, systemic immunosuppression was deemed necessary.
19574702:22	Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests for collagen vascular disease were negative.
19574702:23	In view of the large area of ischemic ulceration, a rotational pedicle graft was considered so as to cover the bare area and also provide vascular supply.
19574702:24	A large pedicle conjuctival flap was dissected from the uninvolved adjacent inferotemporal conjunctiva and was rotated anteriorly to cover the defect.
19574702:25	It was sutured with multiple interrupted 10'0 nylon sutures.
19574702:26	The large bare area created was then draped with a cryopreserved amniotic membrane and sutured similarly.
19574702:27	Postoperatively moxifloxacin 0.5% drops were replaced with a combination of gatifloxacin 0.3% with dexamethasone 0.1% drops four times a day.
19574702:28	Lubricants and oral doxycycline were continued.
19574702:29	The graft was well taken up  and the donor area also healed well.
19574702:30	After two weeks , antibiotic steroid drops were discontinued and a tapering dose of fluoromethalone eye drops were prescribed for a period of three weeks.
19574702:31	Loose sutures were removed at one month and again at two months postoperatively . The patient did not show any recurrence or inflammation until one year of follow-up.
19574702:32	Discussion 
Scleral necrosis and ulceration after posterior segment surgery is rare and can have a varied etiology.
19574702:33	Surgically-induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS), local infection and ischemia due to overcauterization are the most likely causes.
19574702:34	Conjunctival necrosis has been described following intravitreal triamcinolone and subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone and methylprednisolone.
19574702:35	Scleral buckle infection may also cause scleral inflammation and abscess formation.
19574702:36	Mitomycin C and irradiation are known to cause scleral necrosis after use in pterygium surgery.
19574702:37	They are not used in posterior segment surgery but a history of previous exposure to these may be contributory.
19574702:38	SINS following pars plana vitrectomy is rare and requires prompt and aggressive immunosuppression.
19574702:39	Differentiation from an infective postoperative process is essential since use of immunosuppressives in an infection would be detrimental.
19574702:40	Excessive cauterization around the sclerotomy site could be another possible cause of scleral necrosis.
19574702:41	Ischemic scleral necrosis due to overcauterization has been reported after bare sclera pterygium surgery.
19574702:42	This etiology would also not benefit from immunosuppression.
19574702:43	The case presented here did not have clinical evidence of active scleral inflammation around the area of ulceration, had clinically and serologically no evidence of collagen disease and recovered without any systemic immunosuppression.
19574702:44	There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of an active infective process causing the scleral ulceration.
19574702:45	No depot steroids were used and there was no previous exposure to antimetabolites and irradiation.
19574702:46	The only likely possible cause was ischemic necrosis possibly due to overcauterization of the bed around the sclerotomy site.
19574702:47	The patient improved after covering the ulcerated area with a pedicle conjunctival graft, which not only covered the bare surface but also provided blood supply through the pedicle.
20956384:0	Introduction 
The Hedgehog (Hh) cell–cell signaling pathway is conserved in animals and has critical roles in embryonic development, in the maintenance of adult stem cells, and in cancer ( ; ; ; ).
20956384:1	In the resting state of Hh signaling, the transcriptional output of the pathway is kept off by the membrane protein Patched (Ptc), which inhibits the seven-spanner Smoothened (Smo; ).
20956384:2	The Hh pathway is activated when the secreted protein Hh binds and inactivates Ptc ( ; ), thus relieving the inhibition exerted on Smo, which becomes active.
20956384:3	Active Smo signals to the cytoplasm, leading to activation of the zinc finger transcription factors that control the output of the Hh pathway, Cubitus interruptus (Ci) in Drosophila melanogaster ( ; ) and the Gli proteins (Gli1, 2, and 3) in vertebrates.
20956384:4	A unique feature of vertebrate Hh pathway is that primary cilia are essential for signal transduction, and the initial membrane events occur at cilia.
20956384:5	Ptc is located at the base of the primary cilium, and binding of Hh to Ptc leads to activation and recruitment of Smo to the cilium ( ; ).
20956384:6	Through an unknown mechanism, active Smo at the cilium relays Hh signals to the cytoplasm, resulting in the activation of Gli2 and Gli3 ( ; ; ), which control transcription of Hh target genes ( ; ; ).
20956384:7	Since the discovery that Ptc and Smo function at the vertebrate primary cilium, an important question has been to understand how signaling through these upstream components of the Hh pathway couples to activation of the downstream Gli proteins.
20956384:8	An early study showed that Gli proteins localize to cilia in vertebrate limb bud cells; however, the relationship between ciliary localization and the state of Hh signaling was not investigated.
20956384:9	Recently, Gli2 and Gli3 were shown to be recruited to the tip of primary cilia upon Hh stimulation ( ; ; ), which is consistent with the idea that activation of Gli2 and Gli3 by Hh signaling occurs at cilia; however, the mechanism by which Gli proteins are activated at cilia has not been clarified.
20956384:10	In the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, two major negative regulators ensure that the vertebrate Hh pathway is kept off.
20956384:11	The first negative regulator is the Gli-binding protein Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), which in vertebrates is essential for repressing Hh signaling; in cells lacking SuFu, the Hh pathway is maximally activated in a ligand-independent manner ( ; ).
20956384:12	SuFu is thought to inhibit Gli proteins by preventing their nuclear translocation ( ; ; ).
20956384:13	Interestingly, constitutive activation of the Hh pathway in the absence of SuFu is independent of cilia, suggesting that Hh signaling at cilia may activate Gli proteins by inhibiting SuFu.
20956384:14	The second major negative regulator of Hh signaling is PKA.
20956384:15	In Drosophila PKA phosphorylates Ci, and loss of PKA leads to Hh pathway activation ( ; ; ; ), whereas overexpression of PKA inhibits Hh signaling.
20956384:16	The inhibitory effect of PKA is conserved in vertebrate Hh signaling ( ; ) and, interestingly, depends on SuFu ( ; ), suggesting that PKA might inhibit Gli proteins by modulating their interaction with SuFu.
20956384:17	Although SuFu is essential for inhibiting Gli in unstimulated cells, it is unclear whether Hh signaling regulates SuFu.
20956384:18	In one model, SuFu is a simple buffer for Gli and is not regulated by Hh signaling.
20956384:19	This model is consistent with a recent study, which found that Hh stimulation does not affect the interaction between overexpressed Gli2 and Gli3 and SuFu; however, the relevance of this result for normal Hh signaling is unclear given the nonphysiological levels of Gli and SuFu proteins produced by transient transfection.
20956384:20	In another model, Hh signaling at cilia activates Gli proteins by relieving SuFu inhibition, resulting in Gli nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.
20956384:21	This simple model is consistent with at least two findings: (1) the Hh pathway is constitutively active in SuFu −/− cells independent of cilia ( ; ), suggesting that active Smo at cilia might signal by inhibiting SuFu, and (2) activation of PKA by forskolin (FSK) inhibits signaling by active Smo in cells that have SuFu but cannot block constitutive signaling caused by loss of SuFu ( ; ), suggesting that Smo and PKA might exert their opposing effects on Hh signaling through SuFu.
20956384:22	To begin deciphering how active Smo at the cilium activates Gli proteins, we examined the behavior of endogenous SuFu, Gli2, and full-length Gli3 (Gli3-FL) in Hh-responsive mammalian cultured cells.
20956384:23	Focusing on endogenous proteins avoided problems associated with misregulation of overexpressed proteins.
20956384:24	Furthermore, we analyzed biochemically the effect of Hh signaling on endogenous SuFu–Gli protein complexes after brief Hh pathway stimulation to avoid any confounding secondary effects caused by prolonged pathway stimulation.
20956384:25	Our results complement and extend the findings of a recent study that described how Hh signaling leads to the dissociation of SuFu from Gli.
20956384:26	Specifically, our study demonstrates that Hh stimulation through active Smo leads to the recruitment of endogenous SuFu–Gli complexes to cilia and causes the rapid dissociation of a defined SuFu–Gli complex.
20956384:27	Activation of PKA blocks localization of SuFu–Gli complexes to cilia and inhibits their dissociation by Smo, providing an explanation for how PKA inhibits Hh signaling: by uncoupling Smo activation from dissociation of SuFu–Gli complexes.
20956384:28	We propose that vertebrate Hh signals are transduced by active Smo at the primary cilium by dissociating inhibitory SuFu from Gli and that a protein complex that likely contains only SuFu and Gli forms the core of vertebrate Hh signal transduction downstream of Smo.
20956384:29	Results 
Discussion 
A unique feature of the vertebrate Hh pathway is that primary cilia are critical for signal transduction.
20956384:30	The Hh ligand binds its receptor, Ptc, localized at the primary cilium, leading to activation and recruitment of the seven-spanner Smo to the cilium ( ; ), from where it signals to the cytoplasm to activate Gli proteins.
20956384:31	In unstimulated cells, Gli proteins are kept inactive by the cytoplasmic protein SuFu.
20956384:32	In vertebrate cells lacking SuFu, the Hh pathway is maximally active, independent of Smo ( ; ), and independent of cilia.
20956384:33	A simple model for vertebrate Hh signaling is that active Smo at the cilium inhibits SuFu to allow Gli activation; however, a major unanswered question has been if and how SuFu is regulated by Hh signaling.
20956384:34	We found that the endogenous complex formed by SuFu and Gli proteins localizes to cilia and that this ciliary localization is strongly increased by Hh signaling through active Smo.
20956384:35	This suggested that the Hh signal is transmitted from active Smo to the SuFu–Gli complex, leading to Gli activation.
20956384:36	To determine the mechanism that activates Gli, we searched for biochemical changes of SuFu–Gli complexes caused by acute Hh stimulation.
20956384:37	SuFu is an abundant protein (we estimated its concentration in NIH-3T3 cells at ∼100 nM), and a small fraction of SuFu forms a complex with Gli in unstimulated cells, whereas most SuFu is monomeric.
20956384:38	Hh stimulation leads to the rapid dissociation of the SuFu–Gli complex, suggesting a simple mechanism in which Gli activation is the consequence of relieving its inhibition by SuFu, which allows Gli to enter the nucleus.
20956384:39	We do not yet know whether SuFu dissociation from Gli is sufficient to activate Gli or if posttranslational changes are also required such as Gli phosphorylation.
20956384:40	We also do not know whether all dissociation of the SuFu–Gli complex takes place at cilia or whether it also occurs in other parts of the cell.
20956384:41	We propose that SuFu–Gli dissociation is the first step in a series of molecular events through which Gli proteins are activated by Hh signaling.
20956384:42	This mechanism of vertebrate Hh signaling is reminiscent of Hh signal transduction in Drosophila in which Hh stimulation causes the release of Ci complexes by decreasing the affinity of the atypical kinesin costal2 for MTs.
20956384:43	Whether active Gli moves to the nucleus by itself or in complex with SuFu has been a matter of debate.
20956384:44	We favor a model in which Gli enters the nucleus without SuFu for the following reasons: (a) SuFu blocks nuclear localization of overexpressed Gli, whereas Gli proteins are nuclear in the absence of SuFu ( ; this study), (b) Hh stimulation causes the rapid dissociation of SuFu–Gli complexes, indicating that a critical step in generating active Gli is the removal of bound SuFu, and (c) SuFu is not required in the nucleus, as the transcriptional output of the Hh pathway is maximal in SuFu −/− cells.
20956384:45	Recently, the BTB domain protein SPOP was suggested to antagonize the interaction between SuFu and Gli.
20956384:46	However, SPOP does not localize to cilia, and loss of SPOP causes only a modest increase in the unstimulated transcription of Hh target genes, suggesting that although SPOP might play a role in Gli turnover, it likely does not regulate the SuFu–Gli complex during the initial Hh signaling events at the ciliary membrane.
20956384:47	The compartmentalization of vertebrate Hh signaling in primary cilia is accomplished through at least three, largely independent ciliary localization events: (1) localization of Ptc, which is independent of Smo, (2) localization of Smo, which can be uncoupled from upstream components (Ptc and Hh), is independent of downstream components (SuFu and Gli), and is stimulated by PKA, and (3) localization of SuFu–Gli complexes, which is inhibited by PKA.
20956384:48	We speculate that recruitment of SuFu–Gli complexes to cilia ensures that the signal from active Smo is channeled to Gli molecules inhibited by SuFu.
20956384:49	If SuFu were recruited to cilia alone, it would compete with SuFu–Gli complexes and inhibit signaling because monomeric SuFu is present in a large excess over SuFu–Gli.
20956384:50	SuFu–Gli complexes thus serve not only to keep Gli proteins inactive and stable but also to make them activatable by Hh signaling at the cilium.
20956384:51	Based on the size of the endogenous SuFu–Gli complex, we estimate that it might consist of only these two proteins.
20956384:52	Thus, an unexpectedly simple protein complex lies at the core of vertebrate Hh signal transduction downstream of Smo.
20956384:53	It will be important to understand how the integrity of the SuFu–Gli complex is maintained, how signaling stimulates its dissociation, and whether the posttranslational control of SuFu–Gli dissociation occurs at the levels of SuFu, Gli, or both.
20956384:54	Additionally, it will be important to determine how SuFu–Gli complexes localize to cilia and how active Smo increases their ciliary localization.
20956384:55	The PKA activator FSK blocks the transcriptional output of the Hh pathway, although only in the presence of SuFu.
20956384:56	We found that FSK abolishes the localization of the SuFu–Gli complex to cilia and its dissociation by Hh stimulation.
20956384:57	We interpret these findings as follows: (a) dissociation of SuFu–Gli occurs at cilia during Hh signaling and is inhibited if SuFu–Gli cannot travel to the cilium, similar to inhibition of SuFu–Gli dissociation observed in Kif3a −/− cells, and (b) PKA controls trafficking of SuFu–Gli complexes to cilia independent of Smo, suggesting a novel mechanism for Hh inhibition by PKA.
20956384:58	Although PKA localizes to the base of cilia, whether Hh signaling regulates PKA remains unclear; one possibility is that local inhibition of PKA might allow coupling between active Smo and SuFu–Gli complexes at cilia.
20956384:59	However, it is likely that additional events are required to transmit the signal from active Smo to the SuFu–Gli complex because pharmacological inhibition of PKA blocks rather than activates Hh signaling (unpublished data).
20956384:60	Of the three members of the Gli family of transcription factors, our study focused only on Gli2 and Gli3, which mediate the initial response to Hh stimulation.
20956384:61	Gli1 is synthesized in response to Hh signaling ( ; ) and is part of a positive feedback loop that amplifies output of the pathway.
20956384:62	Gli1 binds to and is inhibited by SuFu ( ; ).
20956384:63	We envision that another role of SuFu is to inhibit newly synthesized Gli1 and that the SuFu–Gli1 complex has to pass through the cilium in the presence of active Smo in order for Gli1 to become active.
20956384:64	This would ensure that the Hh pathway remains signal dependent even after prolonged stimulation and accumulation of Gli1 protein, avoiding runaway transcriptional activation.
17985821:0	INTRODUCTION 
In Bangladesh, infectious diseases, such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, are a cause of more than two-thirds of all deaths in children aged less than one year.
17985821:1	The importance of breastfeeding in the prevention of infectious diseases during infancy is well-documented ( – ).
17985821:2	Breastmilk provides protection against pathogens by providing antibacterial and antiviral substances that stimulate the infant's immune system.
17985821:3	A meta-analysis of data from three developing countries showed that infants who were not breastfed had a six-fold greater risk of dying from infectious diseases in the first two months of life than those who were breastfed, and a similar protective effect of breastfeeding has been shown in studies of morbidity from infectious diseases ( – ).
17985821:4	A recent estimate from the Bellagio Child Survival Study Group, which used results of systematic reviews from low- and middle-income countries, predicted that exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding for the first year could prevent 1.3 million child deaths worldwide, making promotion of breastfeeding a key strategy of child-survival programmes.
17985821:5	Exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant receives no solids or liquids apart from breastmilk with the exception of vitamins, minerals, or medicines.
17985821:6	Infants who are exclusively breastfed are less likely to be exposed to contaminated foods and liquids, and this contributes to reductions in the incidence and severity of infectious diseases.
17985821:7	Currently, the recommendation from the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, developed by World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), is that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life.
17985821:8	After six months, infants should receive nutritionally-adequate and safe complementary foods while continuing to be breastfed for up to two years of age or beyond.
17985821:9	Recent estimates predict that current breastfeeding patterns are far below the recommended levels especially in Africa and Asia where rates of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months are less than 40%.
17985821:10	Factors that interact with the protective effect of breastfeeding include environmental, cultural and economic characteristics.
17985821:11	The protective effect of breastfeeding is most important in populations with high infant mortality, high illiteracy, poor sanitation facilities, poor nutritional status, and generally low economic status.
17985821:12	The population of Bangladesh fits all of these criteria.
17985821:13	Surveys of child-feeding practices from Bangladesh showed an almost universal continuation of any breastfeeding up to two years of age.
17985821:14	However, cultural practices include the feeding of prelacteal foods, such as honey, sugar water, or mustard oil immediately after birth contributing to the low prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:15	Current data show that 38% of children aged 2-3 months are exclusively breastfed, and 23% of children are given complementary foods before the sixth month.
17985821:16	In addition, rates of bottlefeeding are high with 30% of infants aged 2-3 months being bottlefed.
17985821:17	The rate of consumption of baby formula in infants aged 4-7 months has almost doubled since 2000 and is highest in urban areas.
17985821:18	This paper describes the infant-feeding practices in Bangladesh using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2003 data and investigates the association between exclusive breastfeeding and child morbidity, in particular diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection.
17985821:19	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
In total, 1,633 children aged three months or under had data available for analysis during the MICS 2003 period between 7 March 2003 and 23 September 2003.
17985821:20	Characteristics of the population are described in Table . Most (n=1,515, or 92.8%) of the children were not registered at birth by a local authority.
17985821:21	The prevalence of breastfeeding practices among the families surveyed is shown in Table . More than 99% of the children were still breastfeeding at the time of interview, but only 34.5% were being exclusively breastfed (prelacteal feeding included).
17985821:22	If the WHO definition of exclusive breastfeeding is used, only 192 (11.7%) children were exclusively breastfed at the time of interview, In total, 823 (50.3%) infants were never exclusively breastfed, 1,450 (88.8%) infants were given breastmilk within three days of birth, and 66.6% of infants were given a prelacteal feed of honey/sugar water or mustard oil after birth.
17985821:23	Table shows the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and illness by age of the child.
17985821:24	The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in infants aged three months was less than 20%.
17985821:25	The prevalence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection was highest in infants aged three months and followed a linear trend with increasing age.
17985821:26	The relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the prevalence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection is shown in Table . In total, 14.3% of the children had diarrhoea in the last 15 days.
17985821:27	Over half (53.6%) of the children in the survey had cough or difficulty breathing in the last 15 days, and 509 (31.2%) children had probable acute respiratory infection.
17985821:28	The prevalence of diarrhoea in this population was significantly associated with lack of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:29	The unadjusted odds ratio was 0.54 (95% CI 0.39-0.74, p<0.0001).
17985821:30	After adjustment for a number of factors, including gender and age of child, number of siblings in the household, stratum, ownership of household, source of drinking-water, place of disposal of faeces, and education of mother, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.69 (95% CI 0.49-0.98, p=0.039).
17985821:31	Table shows the odds ratios for the variables in the model.
17985821:32	Apart from exclusive breastfeeding, the only other significant predictors of diarrhoea were age of the infant and source of drinking-water for the family.
17985821:33	The prevalence of acute respiratory infection was also significantly associated with lack of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:34	The unadjusted odds ratio for acute respiratory infection was 0.55 (95% CI 0.43-0.69).
17985821:35	After adjustment the above factors, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.69 (95% CI 0.54-0.88, p=0.003).
17985821:36	Table shows the odds ratios for the variables in the model.
17985821:37	Other significant predictors of acute respiratory infection apart from exclusive breastfeeding were age of the infant, stratum (rural), and education of mother.
17985821:38	DISCUSSION 
These results confirm a protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding against infectious diseases-related morbidity in infancy.
17985821:39	The observed protection remained even after adjustment for a number of confounders, including demographic variables (age and gender of child), socioeconomic variables (education of mother, stratum, ownership of household), and sanitation variables (source of drinking-water and place of disposal of faeces).
17985821:40	The results showed that children, aged 0-3 month(s), who are exclusively breastfed were less likely to have suffered from diarrhoea (adjusted OR=0.69, 95% CI [0.49-0.98])
17985821:41	or an acute respiratory infection [adjusted OR=0.69, (95% CI 0.54-0.88)] than infants who were not exclusively breastfed.
17985821:42	The results are consistent with those of other studies on the association between mode of feeding and morbidity in children ( – ).
17985821:43	In peri-urban Mexico City, a home-based peer-counselling intervention was conducted to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:44	At three months of age, the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed in intervention groups was more than double the proportion in control groups, and this resulted in a two-fold decrease in diarrhoeal illness (26% vs 12%, p=0.029).
17985821:45	This was comparable with the MICS 2003 analysis where the prevalence of diarrhoeal illness in the exclusively breastfed group was reduced by almost half (16.7% vs 9.8%, p<0.001).
17985821:46	A larger-scale randomized trial—The Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT)—was a multicentre study conducted in the Republic of Belarus in which the maternity-care centres were allocated to an exclusive breastfeeding intervention or control.
17985821:47	In total, 17,046 mother-infant pairs were enrolled, and 16,491 (96.7%) were followed up to the age of one year.
17985821:48	Infants from intervention sites were more likely to be exclusively breastfed at three months (43.3% vs 6.4%; p<0.001).
17985821:49	In addition, infants from intervention sites had a significant reduction in the risk of gastrointestinal tract infections in the first year (13.2% vs 9.1%; adjusted OR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.40-0.91]), but no significant reduction in respiratory tract infection (39.2% vs 39.4%; adjusted OR=0.87 [95% CI 0.59-1.28]) was observed.
17985821:50	The MICS analysis showed a similar OR for diarrhoeal illness, adjusted OR=0.69 (95% CI, 0.49-0.98).
17985821:51	We, however, also showed a significant reduction in respiratory tract illness due to exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted OR 0.69 [95% CI 0.54-0.88]).
17985821:52	A possible explanation for this is the difference in the socioeconomic status between the populations in Belarus and Bangladesh; thus, the possibility of showing an effect in Bangladesh would be greater.
17985821:53	In a cluster-randomized controlled trial in India, eight communities were randomized to receive an educational counselling intervention to promote exclusive breastfeeding for six months or to a control with no specific intervention.
17985821:54	In total, 1,115 mother-infant pairs were enrolled, and 880 (79%) remained in the study at six months.
17985821:55	At three months, rates of exclusive breastfeeding were 79% in intervention communities and 48% in control communities (p<0.0001).
17985821:56	The seven-day prevalence of diarrhoea was significantly lower in intervention than in control communities at three months (OR=0.64 [95% CI 0.44-0.95], p=0.028), and these results are similar to the MICS 2003 analysis.
17985821:57	Although the prevalence of any breastfeeding in Bangladesh is high, the major barriers to achieving the recommendations of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding include a low prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and a high prevalence of prelacteal feeding.
17985821:58	The MICS 2003 data showed that, in a representative sample of infants aged 0-3 month(s), only 34.5% were being exclusively breastfed.
17985821:59	If the WHO definition of exclusive breastfeeding was used, only 11.7% were being exclusively breastfed.
17985821:60	These rates are comparable with recently-published rates from the DHS 2004 which showed that 38% of infants aged 2-3 months were being breastfed exclusively.
17985821:61	Results of an earlier study in 1992 showed that the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 20% at five months, and 16% of infants had been given bottle-feeds by the age of one month.
17985821:62	A limitation in the MICS 2003 dataset is that the prevalence of feeding other liquids, such as juices and formula and solids, are not available and, therefore, the prevalence predominant or partial breastfeeding was not calculated.
17985821:63	In another study in 1996, only 15% of infants were exclusively breastfed to five months of age.
17985821:64	These results showed that the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding has not improved, and only 11.7% of children aged 0-3 month(s) are being fed according to the recommended guidelines.
17985821:65	The demographic, health and social factors can affect the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:66	In one study, mothers who were more educated were less likely to breastfeed their children exclusively for the first five months.
17985821:67	The authors suggest that education is a proxy for socioeconomic status, which could be related to exposure to advertisements and the capability to buy infant formula.
17985821:68	In the MICS 2003, a greater proportion of illiterate women was exclusively breastfeeding (37%) compared to women who had some education (32.4%) which was marginally significant (p=0.053).
17985821:69	Tribal women were also more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding (53.6%).
17985821:70	Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was common in Bangladesh but rates of initiation have improved in recent years.
17985821:71	In a study published in 1996, only 9% of women had initiated breastfeeding immediately after birth.
17985821:72	In a study of rural women conducted in 1996, 27% of women initiated breastfeeding on the third day or later.
17985821:73	In the MICS 2003, 88.8% of the mothers had initiated breastfeeding within the first three days.
17985821:74	The recent DHS survey confirms these results with 24% of women initiating breastfeeding within one hour of birth and 83% of women initiating breastfeeding one day after delivery.
17985821:75	These encouraging results with respect to initiation of breastfeeding suggest that health-promotion messages provided to birth attendants and pregnant women on the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding are working.
17985821:76	The prevalence of prelacteal feeding remains high in Bangladesh.
17985821:77	In a study of 2,105 mothers in rural Bangladesh, 85% had fed their child prelacteal food, and only 10% fed colostrum during the child's first three days of life.
17985821:78	In a study published in 1992, less than 8% of mothers gave colostrum as a first food to their child.
17985821:79	The majority of mothers who did not feed colostrum believed that it caused diarrhoea or stomach upsets.
17985821:80	Although feeding colostrum is reported to be uncommon in other studies, in this survey, it was likely that prelacteal foods, such as honey or sweetened water, were given with colostrum.
17985821:81	Giving sweet prelacteals is thought to be related to the belief that these will ensure a pleasant personality.
17985821:82	In the MICS 2003, 66.6% of the women fed their children prelacteal feeds of honey, sugar water, or mustard oil, and yet a high proportion (88.8%) fed their child breastmilk within the first three days showing that many children were fed colostrum.
17985821:83	There are many limitations to this study.
17985821:84	The most appropriate use of cross-sectional data is to collect information about the burden of illness in a community.
17985821:85	Since the outcome (morbidity) and the study factor (exclusive breastfeeding) are collected at the same time, causation cannot be inferred, and any measured associations may be susceptible to bias.
17985821:86	Confounding occurs when factors relating to breastfeeding practices are also related to morbidity.
17985821:87	Common confounding variables include socioeconomic status, maternal age, or education status, and presence of clean water and sanitation facilities.
17985821:88	We adjusted estimates for a number of variables that were available given the cross-sectional nature of the data.
17985821:89	However, we were not able to correct for maternal age other factors that may have been associated with morbidity, for example maternal nutrition or low birth-weight.
17985821:90	When interpreting results from cross-sectional datasets, the problem of reverse causality may also be a source of bias.
17985821:91	For example, if mothers tended to breastfeed exclusively because the child was ill, the effect of exclusive breastfeeding on illness would have been underestimated.
17985821:92	Conversely, if mothers stopped breastfeeding as a result of illness, this would have biased the results towards an overestimation of an effect.
17985821:93	Other sources of bias include interviewer- and responder-bias and the seasonality of the survey and the fact that only infants who survived up to the time of the interview were included in the analysis.
17985821:94	These factors could not be corrected for in these analyses.
17985821:95	Apart from these limitations, the advantages of cross-sectional datasets, such as those provided by MICS and DHS are the frequency with which they are collected (usually every 2-3 years), the standardized nature of questionnaires, and the representative characteristics of sample.
17985821:96	The datasets are ideal for assessing trends but can also be used for determining associations if confounding factors are controlled for.
17985821:97	In addition, wide dissemination of the MICS results could be used as an opportunity for encouraging governments to re-assess their priorities in regard to children's well-being, to promote breastfeeding, and to achieve the goals of the Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding and the Millennium Development Goals.
17985821:98	In summary, the MICS 2003 data showed that, among surviving children, exclusive breastfeeding was significantly associated with decreased morbidity from diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection in Bangladesh.
17985821:99	Rates of early initiation of breastfeeding are improving.
17985821:100	However, the giving of prelacteal foods, such as honey or sugared water, is still a popular cultural tradition in Bangladesh, and this reduces the true prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding.
17985821:101	The MICS 2003 data showed that only 11.7% of the infants aged less than three months were exclusively breastfed according to the WHO definition which is far below the recommended level.
17985821:102	In a country where almost 70% of infant deaths are attributable to acute respiratory infection or diarrhoea, improving the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to substantially decrease child morbidity and mortality and is imperative to improve rates of child survival.
19561833:0	INTRODUCTION 
Academic writing is distinct from creative writing.
19561833:1	While the latter involves detailed description of feelings, situations and scenes, the former requires only facts without editorial comment or extraneous detail.
19561833:2	That which we learned in primary school must be modified substantially for scientific communication.
19561833:3	The purpose of this paper is to provide a primer for inexperienced academic writers, mentor this important academic skill, and minimize the potential for harsh critique that will crush the intellectual curiosity needed to pursue clinical research.
19561833:4	CLARITY OF WRITING REFLECTS CLARITY OF THOUGHT 
It is critical to outline a paper before beginning to write, using, for example, the template included here to include all vital elements ( online at ).
19561833:5	Vary your sentence length to improve readability, alternating between short and long ones.
19561833:6	If your concept is highly technical and requires a long explanation of a complicated process, with parenthetical phrases and multiple qualifiers, follow this with a short sentence.
19561833:7	Your reader will appreciate it.
19561833:8	The previous two sentences are an example of this concept.
19561833:9	Conversely, avoid run-on sentences, or using more than one parenthetical phrase, (separated by commas) per sentence.
19561833:10	Instead, simply divide the sentence into two.
19561833:11	A paragraph should have at least three sentences and rarely more than six.
19561833:12	These include at least a topic sentence, an explanation of the topic, and a concluding sentence.
19561833:13	If there are only two sentences, incorporate these into the previous or following paragraph.
19561833:14	When you have finished your draft, have someone not in your field, or not even in medicine, review the paper before submission.
19561833:15	A college graduate should be able to understand much of medical writing.
19561833:16	If they are lost, the paper needs more work.
19561833:17	Write in plain English, rather than a foreign language called “medicine.”
19561833:18	Avoid politicizing a research paper.
19561833:19	If you consider a concept politically or socially provocative, it probably does not belong in a research paper.
19561833:20	There is little room for opinion in scientific writing as the facts speak for themselves.
19561833:21	Only the “Discussion” section should contain opinion, clearly prefaced by “we believe,” and limited to a few sentences or conjectures.
19561833:22	Most authors inherently overstate the importance of their findings, as they are invested in the project after years of work.
19561833:23	It is almost always appropriate to tone down conclusions, as the definitive paper which settles an issue is exceedingly rare.
19561833:24	To gain experience with academic writing, consider volunteering as a reviewer.
19561833:25	This flips perspective from author to consumer, and provides insight into common problems in academic writing.
19561833:26	This process is time-consuming and intellectually demanding.
19561833:27	A good review easily takes 2–3 hours, but will pay off in spades with a smooth road to the promised land of accepted publications.
19561833:28	What is wrong with the previous sentence?
19561833:29	It includes three colloquialisms that do not belong in academic writing: “pay off in spades,” “smoother road,” and, “promised land.”
19561833:30	It is also passive voice.
19561833:31	The sentence would read better as: “You will need to spend 2–3 hours on a good review, but this will enhance your papers’ chances for acceptance.
19561833:32	(129 vs. 108 characters, or 16% shorter) 
SITTING DOWN TO WRITE THE PAPER 
You may choose to use the template from the University of California, San Diego Emergency Medicine Residency, included as an appendix on-line at . 
The title should answer the question posed by the paper.
19561833:33	It should include the study design: retrospective vs. prospective, randomized controlled trial, cohort study, before and after study, case series or report.
19561833:34	Truncate the title as needed, as some journals have an 80-character limit, striking the best balance between brevity and accuracy.
19561833:35	Spell out all abbreviations.
19561833:36	A structured abstract is next, and must include all major findings.
19561833:37	The “introduction” should be two sentences maximum, framing the background of the investigation.
19561833:38	The “objective” sentence follows, and then the “methods” can be listed in 2–3 sentences, including the setting.
19561833:39	Results should begin with the most important finding, and then, at most 1–2 secondary outcomes.
19561833:40	The “conclusion” should be one sentence, qualified to clarify the subject population you studied.
19561833:41	Readers may read and act upon the abstract alone, and even more distressing, only the “conclusion” sentence.
19561833:42	These therefore must be able to stand alone with complete and honest reporting of both positive and negative results.
19561833:43	Adhere to word count limits for abstracts, which vary by journal from 250–400 words.
19561833:44	The abstract should parallel the body of the paper in content and order.
19561833:45	It is common to write the abstract first as an outline, then the paper itself.
19561833:46	However, some results and conclusions may change in the arduous and lengthy writing process.
19561833:47	Therefore, it is critical to return to the abstract and assure consistency in methods, results and conclusions.
19561833:48	Nothing brands a paper as sloppy more than this common problem.
19561833:49	The reviewer and editor think, “If the authors don’t care enough to make the numbers match, then what confidence can I have in attention to detail in their research?”
19561833:50	Such blatant inconsistency casts a pall on the entire peer-review.
19561833:51	The introduction is typically four paragraphs, and should not be a literature review.
19561833:52	Rather, it should frame the problem or hypothesis, drawing from a few key papers whose conclusions lead to the question at hand.
19561833:53	All other citations belong in the discussion (save “methods” published previously).
19561833:54	The last sentence should be “we hypothesized,” or “our objective was…” or similar.
19561833:55	The methods section should describe the setting, the inclusiveness of the sample, specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and the intervention, if any.
19561833:56	How were subjects identified?
19561833:57	How did you gather, record and analyze the data?
19561833:58	What safeguards were in place to protect data integrity and accuracy?
19561833:59	What statistical tests and programs did you use?
19561833:60	It is important to have a statistician or senior researcher write or review this portion of the methods section.
19561833:61	If equipment or computer programs were used, list the manufacturer, model or version number, which would enable a reader to replicate the study.
19561833:62	If the study is a retrospective chart review, describe compliance with the 7–12 elements outlined in one of two methodology papers by Gilbert and Lowenstein or Worster and Bledsoe.
19561833:63	Within the results section, present the primary outcome measure first, followed by secondary ones.
19561833:64	If there are more than four or five related results, report them in a graph or table.
19561833:65	Text in the results section should not repeat graphic or tabular results, but rather provide a synopsis of results.
19561833:66	Design graphs in black and white, with different patterns, as most print journals are not color and the resultant shades of gray are difficult to discriminate.
19561833:67	Describe results in absolute, not relative, terms.
19561833:68	For example, “The absolute risk reduction in mortality was 2% (4% to 2%)” rather than, “The relative risk reduction was 50%.”
19561833:69	This is intellectually honest, and avoids artificially inflating the relative benefit of an intervention.
19561833:70	To compare groups, use p values with 95% confidence intervals, and report the number-needed-to-treat and to harm from the absolute difference in outcomes.
19561833:71	This gives information to gauge clinical import of the intervention.
19561833:72	For diagnostic tests, use likelihood ratios in addition to sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values.
19561833:73	This allows the reader to change the pre-test probability of a condition to a post-test one after the diagnostic test, using the Fagan nomogram.
19561833:74	Even if key findings in a picture or figure seem obvious, annotate them with arrows to provide greater clarity.
19561833:75	Pictures must be high resolution, as low resolution images show pixels in print.
19561833:76	Because tables and figures may be removed from the body of the paper and must therefore stand alone, define abbreviations, even if done elsewhere.
19561833:77	The legends for both tables and figures are usually submitted on separate pages.
19561833:78	In the discussion, highlight the most important findings first, following the order of the methods and results sections.
19561833:79	Discussion of secondary outcomes should follow.
19561833:80	Limit and clearly label opinion, and identify how, and if, the study could or should change practice.
19561833:81	Limit this section to 5–6 items, each with 1–2 paragraphs.
19561833:82	Avoid submitting a comprehensive literature review, rather confining it to the outcomes of the paper.
19561833:83	Authors commonly overstate their conclusions and offer them despite not having studied the issue.
19561833:84	These should be quite narrow, and focused only on the sample studied.
19561833:85	The definitive study is near impossible, so qualifiers such as “it appears,” or “from these data” are appropriately included.
19561833:86	Further investigation is always warranted.
19561833:87	Remember that retrospective studies cannot, by definition, show causation, only association, so use this word when indicated.
19561833:88	Make the conclusion specific enough to stand alone.
19561833:89	Include for example, “in adults,” or “in emergency department patients with a chief complaint of chest pain...”
19561833:90	For case reports the conclusion should state the learning objective.
19561833:91	Avoid statements such as, “The emergency physician must know about this rare condition…” and instead use phrases such as, “We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this condition…” 
The limitations section should be 1–2 paragraphs and acknowledge major flaws, such as small sample size/underpowered study, incomplete patient enrollment, patients lost to follow up, obvious sources of bias, retrospective design, lack of blinding, controls, or generalizability.
19561833:92	It is better to be honest up front about shortcomings, rather than be guaranteed additional criticism in the peer-review process.
19561833:93	The references of course must be complete and correct, and conform to a journal’s required format.
19561833:94	The placement of citations within the body of the paper must also conform to a journal’s convention.
19561833:95	It is important to do another literature review before submission, as new publications may have bearing on the paper, and failure to do so risks embarrassment if the reviewer finds pertinent references not included.
19561833:96	RESPONDING TO THE FIRST CRITIQUE 
A very small minority of papers are accepted without revision, so expect a harsh critique.
19561833:97	Whether resubmitting to the same journal, or to another, follow the reviewer’s suggestions assiduously.
19561833:98	If the review asks for information you did not collect, or cannot produce, acknowledge this in the limitations section.
19561833:99	With repeated submissions, this section tends to grow sometimes longer than the discussion section itself.
19561833:100	Take a critical look at the clarity of the paper.
19561833:101	If the first reviewers did not understand the paper, neither will subsequent ones.
19561833:102	Show the paper to a colleague unfamiliar with the project, and respond to their confusion by clarifying seemingly obvious points.
19561833:103	If resubmitting to the same journal, avoid defensiveness in your response.
19561833:104	Outline the changes you make in a point-by-point cover letter, so the reviewer can easily see compliance with suggested changes, and complete this within one month.
19561833:105	Swift resubmission will increase chances of acceptance, as the reviewer will retain familiarity with the paper.
19561833:106	CONCLUSION 
Academic writing is at worst maddening and at best painstaking.
19561833:107	Attention to detail in reporting should parallel the same in execution of the project.
19561833:108	With adherence to this advice, the severity of the critique will be manageable, and desire to replicate the research process will remain unscathed.
19561833:109	The Editors of WestJEM wish you the best of luck in your academic writing.

21886611:0	EEG Evidence for a Cumulative Process in the SMA 
In two different timing tasks (a production and a discrimination one) Macar et al. showed that the mesial frontal cortex, including the SMAs, behaves in an accumulator-like way.
21886611:1	The authors recorded the contingent negative variation (CNV: Walter et al., ) an electrical activity of the brain which develops between two events of interest separated by a predictable time interval.
21886611:2	In line with the results of Casini and Macar, the authors hypothesized that spontaneous fluctuations of brain activation should influence the speed of the pacemaker, determining the number of accumulated pulses and, hence, subjective temporal estimation.
21886611:3	Using the CNV as an index of the accumulation process, Macar et al. observed that the larger the estimated duration, the larger the CNV over the SMAs (Figure ).
21886611:4	These observations, suggesting that the SMAs act as an accumulator, have since been reproduced with identical intervals (Macar and Vidal, ) and with shorter intervals involving the auditory modality (Bendixen et al., ).
21886611:5	Moreover, Noguchi and Kakigi recorded the magnetic counterpart of the CNV in a timing task and observed the same magnetic build-up of activity around the SMAs during the interval to be estimated.
21886611:6	In addition, Noguchi and Kakigi found a positive correlation between the amplitude of the visual evoked magnetic field (VEF) and the size of the CNV-like field.
21886611:7	If one hypothesizes that the amplitude of the VEF can be interpreted as an index of activation, a larger VEF is representative of a larger activation which, in agreement with the concept proposed by Macar et al. should be associated with more accumulated pulses and, hence, a larger magnetic CNV.
21886611:8	fMRI Evidence for a Cumulative Process in the SMA 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging data also point toward the SMAs playing a key role in time processing.
21886611:9	According to Zakay, the more attention is paid to time, the more pulses are accumulated, which accounts for the well known effects of attention on timing performance (e.g., Casini and Macar, ; for a review see Brown, ).
21886611:10	Coull et al. showed that when the amount of attention is explicitly controlled SMA activity positively correlates with attention paid to timing.
21886611:11	SMAs therefore behave as the accumulator postulated by the model.
21886611:12	In addition, in reproduction tasks where time has to be successively coded and retrieved, the pacemaker-counter model postulates that the accumulator is necessarily switched on at the beginning of both stages (coding and retrieval).
21886611:13	Several brain areas have now been shown to be active in a reproduction task.
21886611:14	However, the SMAs were the only area to be engaged during both stages of the task (Figure ; Coull et al., ). As such, the SMAs seem to be the only structure where the accumulation process can take place.
21886611:15	Single Cell Recordings Evidence for a Cumulative Process in the SMA 
Further evidence supporting the presence of a cumulative process in SMAs used for timing can be found in single unit recordings of awake monkeys, both in temporal production and estimation.
21886611:16	In a production task, Mita et al. found neurons in the SMA and pre-SMA exhibiting decay or build-up patterns evoking a cumulative process.
21886611:17	In these so called “time graded” neurons the longer the interval to be produced, the higher the firing rate at the end of the interval (Figure B).
21886611:18	In addition, Akkal et al. recorded neurons in the pre-SMA during a reaction time task using fixed or variable foreperiods.
21886611:19	Only when the foreperiod was fixed, i.e., only when foreperiod duration could be accurately predicted, did pre-SMA neurons behave in an accumulator-like way: During the fixed foreperiod, neuronal activity exhibited a particular build-up pattern culminating at the end of the delay (Figure A).
21886611:20	The authors concluded that the build-up pattern they observed could “… represent the neuronal substrate of the temporal accumulator property proposed by previous authors” (page, 1286).
21886611:21	Indeed, the neuronal patterns observed in Figure are reminiscent of the time course of the CNV displayed in Figure .
21886611:22	Other Timing Processes Outside the SMAs?
21886611:23	Where could pulses stored in the SMAs come from?
21886611:24	Several arguments provided by animal as well as patient studies indicate that the basal ganglia could host the pacemaker system (for reviews see Buhusi and Meck, ; Coull et al., ). For example, dopaminergic drugs are known to selectively affect the speed of an internal clock in both animals and humans.
21886611:25	Moreover, patients with Parkinson's disease show impaired temporal performance in both motor and sensory timing within both the second and sub-second time ranges.
21886611:26	It should be noted that the SMAs are one of the main targets of the basal ganglia via the thalamus.
21886611:27	Finally, it is often assumed that to provide accurate timing, in addition to specific “clock” processes, distinct non-specific memory, and decisional components are also required.
21886611:28	When subjects have to memorize a “target” duration and judge whether a probe interval is shorter, equal or longer, the CNV recorded during the probe ends at the moment when the target would end, even when the probe lasts longer (Macar and Vidal, ; Pfeuty et al., ).
21886611:29	It is noteworthy that during these longer probes no external information indicates that the target duration is over.
21886611:30	Therefore, this effect may only be explained by assuming subjects used internal information which can be viewed as temporal memory.
21886611:31	However, Macar and Vidal showed that this temporal memory effect was not implemented by the SMAs but in other, not currently fully identified, structures.
21886611:32	In sum, the functional role of the SMA in timing seems well confined to the cumulative process.
21213047:0	Introduction 
The administration of nanosecond second pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) is emerging as a novel stimulus for inducing cell death.
21213047:1	Apoptosis can be activated by nsPEFs in various cancer cell lines in vitro  , a fibrosarcoma tumor ex vivo   and in B16f10 melanoma tumors in vivo . Apoptosis is a highly conserved mechanism in eukaryotes for eliminating superfluous, aberrant and damaged cells.
21213047:2	It is a complex cascade of events morphologically characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) resulting in plasma membrane blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies . These morphological features are believed to be caused at least in part by activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which plays a crucial role to initiate and execute apoptosis  , although other proteases may also be activated.
21213047:3	Caspases can be triggered through extrinsic death receptor pathways or intrinsic pathways depending on the cell type and stimulus . Extrinsic pathway are initiated by specific ligands, such as Fas and TRAIL, which aggregate their cognate death receptor, allowing assembly of death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC) on the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes leading to initiator caspase-8 (and/or -10) activation.
21213047:4	In type I cells, caspase-8 activates executioner caspases independent of mitochondria.
21213047:5	In type II cell pathways, caspase-8 cleaves the BH3-only protein Bid to activate pro-apoptotic truncated Bid (t-Bid).
21213047:6	Translocation of t-Bid triggers cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-9 activation through formation of the apoptosome, which causes cell demise through activation of caspase-3.
21213047:7	Unlike conventional electroporation, which primarily affects plasma membranes , nsPEFs also electroporate intracellular membranes . Modeling studies [ , ] and evidence determined experimentally by patch clamp and fluorescent imaging studies , indicated that nsPEFs with sufficiently short pulse durations and rapid rise times  induced nanopores in plasma membranes that were often smaller than propidium iodide (PI).
21213047:8	This supra-electroporation involved all cell membranes going through cells, extensively penetrating all organellar membranes . Effects on intracellular vesicles were observed without measurable effects on plasma membranes  with PI or calcein and on intracellular calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum and capacitative calcium entry in HL-60 cells , suggesting that these external electric fields can mimic ligand signaling .
21213047:9	It is now know that the absence of effects on plasma membranes was due to the presence of nano pores that were too small to allow entry of the membrane markers or that detection systems were insufficiently sensitive to measure them . Nevertheless, modeling evidence suggests that under certain circumstances it is possible to have effects on intracellular membranes without effects on the plasma membrane . 
Studies have suggested that nsPEF-induced apoptosis mechanisms are cell type-dependent.
21213047:10	In Jurkat cells caspase activation and cytochrome c release were nearly coincident, making it difficult to differentiate between extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms . In B16f10 cells cytochrome c was not released, implicating the extrinsic apoptosis pathway typical of type I cells . In HCT 116 cells, caspase activation occurred before cytochrome c release, suggesting activation of extrinsic pathways followed by mitochondria-mediated cytochrome c release through the intrinsic pathway, type II cell extrinsic apoptosis pathway and/or feed-forward amplification from the initial extrinsic signal .
21213047:11	However, specific contributions from extrinsic or intrinsic mechanisms have not been determined.
21213047:12	Available data indicate pervasive effects of nsPEF on all cell membranes inducing apoptosis signaling in several cell types.
21213047:13	However, their mechanisms, sites of action and unambiguous confirmation of apoptosis pathways contributing to cell death have not been clearly determined.
21213047:14	In this study, we demonstrate direct activation of apoptosis signaling through multiple mechanisms and quantify relative contributions from several apoptosis pathways originating from both plasma membranes and intracellular membranes that exhibit both dependence and independence of caspases, calpains, calcium, and cytochrome c release.
21213047:15	Several quantified nsPEF-induced biological functions exhibit different electric field sensitivities and kinetics that promote heterogeneous apoptosis characteristics in E4 squamous carcinoma cells (SCC).
21213047:16	Diverse effects of nsPEFs on different E4 SCC death mechanisms and programmed pathways can induce cell death by multiple mechanisms bypassing apoptosis-deficient syndromes in SCC.
21213047:17	Experimental procedures 
Results 
Discussion 
Evidence from E4 SCC gives new insight and understanding for cell death and apoptosis-like mechanisms and their origin in response to nsPEFs.
21213047:18	In the experiments presented here we quantified a diverse set of cell responses to nsPEFs in E4 SCC.
21213047:19	The results indicate that cell death can be dependent and/or independent of caspase activity, calpain activity, calcium from intracellular stores or extracellular media, cytochrome c release and decreases in Δψm.
21213047:20	Thus, nsPEFs initiated charge-mediated events in plasma membranes and intracellular membranes through multiple signaling mechanisms inducing signatures of apoptosis and other forms of cell death.
21213047:21	Even at the highest electric fields investigated, frank necrosis as defined by immediate plasma membrane rupture was not present, so cell death is driven by biological responses that appear to be, at least in part, programmed.
21213047:22	Ibey et al.  found that apoptosis (DNA fragmentation of agarose gels) was present in U937 cells exposed to 600 pulses at 10 ns and 100 kV/cm (700 J/g); however, necrosis was a major form of cell death.
21213047:23	However, in this study the cell type was different and the energy absorbed or dose (J/g) for the pulses was about seven times higher than in the present study (~700 vs. ~100 J/g).
21213047:24	It should be pointed out that factors other than energy absorbed are likely involved to determine nsPEF effects .
21213047:25	After treatment with nsPEFs caspases are activated at earlier times and at lower electric fields than cytochrome c release, demonstrating initial activation of a type I cell extrinsic pathway.
21213047:26	This is similar to results in nsPEF treated HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells , but different than B16f10 cells that did not release cytochrome c  and Jurkat cells with concomitant cytochrome c release and caspase activation .
21213047:27	This clearly defines cell type-specific response to nsPEF-induced cell death.
21213047:28	Unlike the other analyzes, here we show for the first time caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cytochrome c release, demonstrating the additional presence of a type II cell extrinsic pathway through Bid cleavage for cytochrome c release.
21213047:29	Caspase-dependent (55–60%) and calcium-dependent (40–45%) Bid cleavage pathways were demonstrated with quantitative and reciprocal increases in t-Bid and decreases in Bid.
21213047:30	Further, for calcium-dependent Bid cleavage, extracellular calcium (~70%) played a predominant role compared to calcium from intracellular stores (~30%).
21213047:31	Caspase-independent Bid cleavage is most likely accomplished by charge-mediated interventions with calcium signaling from and/or nanoporation in the endoplasmic reticulum, capacitative calcium entry  and/or calcium entry through nanopores in plasma membranes .
21213047:32	Since caspase activation has been shown to be calcium-independent , calcium-dependent Bid cleavage appears to be due to calpain activation.
21213047:33	This was confirmed by showing calcium-sensitive calpain activity was specifically inhibited by the calpain inhibitor z-LLY-fmk.
21213047:34	Taken together, these results show for the first time nsPEF-mediated at least two mechanisms for Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release—one caspase-dependent and one calpain-dependent.
21213047:35	While there are reports of cross-talk and/or synergistic behaviors between calpains and caspases , since the sum of caspase-dependent and calpain-dependent Bid cleavage activities, which were determined independently of the other, equal about 100% of total Bid cleavage.
21213047:36	Generation of t-Bid, a critical point connecting extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, by at least two different protease families provides beneficial repetitive mechanisms to maximize cytochrome c release and apoptosis induction through mitochondria pathways.
21213047:37	Thus, nsPEFs promote pro-apoptotic signals that overcome resistances to apoptosis, which are present in most if not all cancers, thereby potentially abolishing the universal cancer hallmark of apoptosis evasion . 
By analyzing several different E4 cell responses to nsPEFs by flow cytometry, it was possible to establish several other characteristics for nsPEF-induced cell death.
21213047:38	Under nsPEF conditions that eliminated ≥95% of E4 SCC, only 50% of cells exhibited cytochrome c release and decreases in Δψm, while 75–80% of cells exhibited active caspases.
21213047:39	Moreover, each of these responses showed different thresholds or sensitivities among themselves, with cytochrome c release as the least sensitive response.
21213047:40	Sensitivities for plasma and inner mitochondria membrane permeability appeared to be similar, although plasma membrane reactions as determined by PI uptake and PS externalization were overall more responsive than inner mitochondria membrane as determined by decreases in Δψm.
21213047:41	These are most likely due to nanopore formation in the respective membranes.
21213047:42	These results are consistent with an overall greater initial response from plasma membrane sensitivity leading to activation of extrinsic apoptosis mechanisms compared to intrinsic mechanisms from mitochondria membrane sensitivity.
21213047:43	An extrinsic mechanism is also consistent with a greater response from extracellular calcium and a lesser response from intracellular calcium.
21213047:44	The predominance of extrinsic mechanisms with greater effects on plasma membranes and from extracellular calcium-dependent responses compared to intrinsic mechanisms measured by decreases in Δψm and intracellular calcium-dependent responses can possibly be explained by characteristics of electric fields pulses.
21213047:45	Pulsed electric field requirements for intracellular membrane effects include a fast pulse rise time, high electric fields, and a pulse duration that is shorter than the relaxation time of intracellular membrane, which is on the order of ~100 ns . While pulses used here have sufficient rise times and electric fields (≤4 ns and 60 kV/cm, respectively), the relatively long 300 ns pulse duration may not be short enough to allow fully effective intracellular effects.
21213047:46	While the mechanism(s) for caspase activation remains to be defined, nsPEF effects are due to membrane charging events.
21213047:47	While PI uptake occurs in >95% of cells, and cytochrome c is released in about 50% of cells, caspases are activated in 75–80% of cells.
21213047:48	This suggests that charging of the plasma membrane may be more closely tied to caspase activation than charging of intracellular membranes.
21213047:49	This is consistent with caspase activation occurring before cytochrome c release, reminiscent of the type I cell extrinsic mechanism, and greater numbers of cells exhibiting PI uptake at lower electric fields than cells with decreased Δψm.
21213047:50	At the highest electric field tested (60 kV/cm), all of these nsPEF-induced responses are coincident with cell death in >95% of cells indicating heterogeneous cell responses in nsPEF-induced cell death.
21213047:51	Given that ~75–80% of cells express active caspases, caspase-associated cell death appears to be a predominant event.
21213047:52	Thus, cell death occurs against different backgrounds of mitochondria responses in Δψm, cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
21213047:53	While decreases in Δψm, caspase activation and cytochrome c release may all occur within given populations of cells, other cell populations may exhibit one or more of these, most notably through the cytochrome c -independent extrinsic pathway(s).
21213047:54	Thus, nsPEF-induced apoptosis mechanisms are heterogeneous within E4 SCC populations as well as heterogeneous among cell types . 
Special consideration should be made for using PI uptake as a cell viability marker and phosphatidylserine externalization as an apoptosis marker in response to electric field stimulation.
21213047:55	Using PI as a viability marker could be misleading given that electric fields have transient and reversible effects on membrane permeability.
21213047:56	Some cells can survive after conventional electroporation as well as after sub-lethal nsPEF conditions .
21213047:57	Thus, to avoid possible erroneous conclusions when evaluating effects of electric field on plasma membranes it is not advisable to use PI uptake as a viability marker.
21213047:58	In the studies here, 300 ns pulse durations are long enough to allow plasma membrane pores to expand so they are large enough to include PI, which is on the order of about a nanometer.
21213047:59	Nevertheless, the pulse durations are short and fast enough to induce intracellular membrane effects.
21213047:60	Moreover, modeling evidence indicates that nsPEFs can “pull” phosphatidylserine through nanopores   acting as an apoptotic mimic that in the presence of macrophages was shown to cause phagocytosis of caspase-negative cells . Thus, to avoid possible erroneous conclusions, phosphatidylserine externalization should not be used as an apoptosis marker or used very cautiously when evaluating effects of electric fields on plasma membranes.
21213047:61	Particularly, PI and Annexin-V should not be used alone as indicators for viability/necrosis and apoptosis, respectively, when evaluating effects of electric fields or other stimuli.
21213047:62	In addition, defining apoptosis characteristic in vitro can be complicated by the presence of artifacts that are not present during apoptosis in vivo.
21213047:63	In this study, events within the first 2 h were a primary focus to avoid or lessen these issues.
21213047:64	While time courses for cell death are stimuli-dependent, nsPEF effects occur relatively rapidly in E4 cells.
21213047:65	What can be discerned in this time fame, especially within the first hour(s), is reported in this study.
21213047:66	There may be a case made for a unique type of nsPEF-induced cell death.
21213047:67	Cell death initiated by nsPEFs can be differentiated from TNF-induced necroptosis, H 2O 2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis  in that nsPEF, in contrast to cold exposure, did not exhibit ROS generation determined with CM-H 2DCFDA and did not lead to hyperpolarization of Δψm as the other stimuli-induced cell death did.
21213047:68	Thus, E4 SCC mechanisms that protect against DNA and other damage from ROS are not expected to be effective in response to nsPEFs.
21213047:69	Given that electric fields with nsPEF characteristics do not exist in nature, nsPEFs provide a distinct cell death stimulus, which could account for the heterogeneity of nsPEF-induced responses in E4 SCC.
21213047:70	In E4 cells, new evidence is provided that nsPEFs act through multiple mechanisms to induce cell death at least in part due to apoptosis through extrinsic type I, extrinsic type II and/or intrinsic pathway(s).
21213047:71	Based on several lines of evidence, the type I extrinsic pathway appears to be predominant among these.
21213047:72	While calpain activation can be initiated by mobilization of calcium from intracellular and/or extracellular sources by nanopore formation, it remains to be determined how a presumed plasma membrane stimulus leads to caspase activation.
21213047:73	The extrinsic pathway is activated by plasma membrane death receptors.
21213047:74	It is possible that electric field interactions with the plasma membrane could activate these receptors either through nanopore formation or some other charging event that rearranges lipid bilayers.
21213047:75	Alternatively, changes in membrane permeability could alter the intracellular milieu, such as apoptosis volume decrease , leading to caspase activation.
21213047:76	Aside from caspase activation other mechanisms are likely to contribute to nsPEF-induced cell death.
21213047:77	Since necrosis induced by immediate plasma membrane rupture is not a significant cause of E4 SCC cell death, nsPEFs must set into motion events that are mediated by biological mechanisms in response to nsPEF-mediated stresses that are at least in part programmed.
21078197:0	Background 
Cupping therapy belongs to traditional Chinese medicine, the heritage from several thousand years.
21078197:1	It is used with one of several kinds of cups, such as bamboo cups, glasses or earthen cups, placing them on the desired acupoints on patients' skin, to make the local place hyperemia or haemostasis, which can obtain the purpose of curing the diseases . The earliest records of cupping is in Bo Shu (an ancient book written on silk), which was discovered in an ancient tomb of the Han Dynasty in 1973.
21078197:2	Some therapeutic cupping methods and case records of treatment were also described in early Chinese books.
21078197:3	Zhao Xueming, a Chinese doctor practicing more than 200 years ago, completed a book named " Ben Cao Gang Mu Shi Yi ", in which he described in detail the history and origin of different kinds of cupping and cup shapes, functions and applications . 
There are seven major types of cupping practice in China.
21078197:4	Usually, cupping practitioners utilize the flaming heating power to achieve suction (minus pressure) inside the cups to make them apply on the desired part of the body.
21078197:5	This basic suction method of cupping therapy is called retained cupping, which is most commonly used in Chinese clinics as the first type of cupping.
21078197:6	Besides this kind of suction, different types of cupping composed with different methods.
21078197:7	The second type of cupping is bleeding cupping (or wet cupping), which contains two steps: before the suction of the cups, practitioners should make some small incisions with a triangle-edged needle or plum-blossom needle firmly tapping the acupoint for a short time to cause bleeding; the third one is moving cupping, which practitioners should control the suction by gently moving the cup toward one direction; then is empty cupping, which means the cups are removed after suction without delay; or needle cupping, which should apply the acupuncture first, then apply the cups over the needle.
21078197:8	Cupping practitioners may also used other methods of suction, such as medicinal (herbal) cupping, which used bamboo cups, usually put the cups and herbal into a deep pan with water and boiled them together, after 30 minutes apply the cup suction on specific points according to steam instead of fire; or water cupping which is a technique involves filling a glass or bamboo cup one-third full with warm water and pursuing the cupping process in a rather quick fashion.
21078197:9	Each kind of cupping therapy may be used for different diseases or different purposes of treatment.
21078197:10	Because cupping is widely used in Chinese folklore culture, the technique has been inherited by the modern Chinese practitioners.
21078197:11	In the 1950s the clinical efficacy of cupping was confirmed by Co-Research of China and acupuncturists from the former Soviet Union, and was established as an official therapeutic practice in hospitals all over China . This issue substantially stimulated the development of further cupping research.
21078197:12	In the context of evidence-based medicine (EBM), we need to evaluate therapeutic effect of cupping therapy to inform the practice heritage from ancient time.
21078197:13	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
According to our findings, clinical studies on cupping therapy were obviously improved either on number or quality during the last 50 years.
21078197:14	Though the methodological quality of the included RCTs were generally poor, some quality items showed that it was improved during the last 10 years, such as the number of the RCTs which reported the sequence generation of randomization (Table : Reporting of five quality components in randomized clinical trials on cupping therapy).
21078197:15	But we should wake up to that these studies leave much scope for well designed, conducted and reported trials.
21078197:16	We included 550 clinical studies in this review, only 73 RCTs were published in the last two decades, 78.1% of these RCTs were with high risk of bias.
21078197:17	According to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) , randomization methods need to be clearly described and fully reported.
21078197:18	Although blinding of the cupping therapy might be very difficult, blinding of outcome assessors and statistics should be attempted as much as possible to minimize performance and assessment biases.
21078197:19	Sample size calculation and analysis of outcomes based on intention-to-treat principle are important.
21078197:20	Similar to acupuncture, cupping therapy is a kind of treatment which relevant to meridian and acupoints, so researchers may consult to the standard of STRICTA  on trial report, which means details of cupping treatment should be reported, such as type of cups, experience of the practitioners, period and frequency of the treatment.
21078197:21	About one third of the included RCTs did not report the diagnostic criteria, 63.0% of the RCTs did not report the criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and the use of composite outcome measures in 51 (69.9%) trials to evaluate overall improvement of symptoms, all the issues limit the generalization of the findings.
21078197:22	The classification of "cure", "markedly effective", "effective" or "ineffective" is not internationally recognized, and it is hard to interpret the effect.
21078197:23	All of the above uncertain items may increase the clinical heterogeneity.
21078197:24	We suggest future trials completely report all the criteria they chose and comply with international standards in the evaluation of treatment effect.
21078197:25	We searched PubMed database using the above searching strategy, only 2 RCTs were published by international researchers outside of China until 2008.
21078197:26	One tested wet cupping therapy on serum lipid concentrations , which concluded that wet cupping may be an effective method of reducing LDL cholesterol in men and consequently may have a preventive effect against atherosclerosis.
21078197:27	Another study tested wet cupping therapy for nocturnal brachialgia paraesthetica , which suggested short-term effects of a single wet cupping therapy.
21078197:28	Meanwhile, two further RCTs with cupping originating outside China have been published after 2008, demonstrating increasing interest in this field.
21078197:29	One trial  found that traditional wet-cupping care was significantly more effective in reducing bodily pain than usual care at 3-month follow-up with satisfactory safety and acceptance to patients with nonspecific low back pain.
21078197:30	Another trial  investigated the effectiveness of cupping therapy with the conclusion that cupping therapy may be effective in relieving pain and other symptoms related to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), however, the efficacy of cupping in the long-term management of CTS and related mechanisms remains to be clarified.
21078197:31	We are glad to see that these trials are apparently with good methodological quality, however, though most of the clinical trials showed positive results on therapeutic effect of cupping therapy, the appropriate duration of the cupping therapy, the syndrome differentiation for acupoints selection, and the frequency of the cupping therapy were unclear according to current evidence.
21078197:32	Future studies should address these issues.
21078197:33	This review suggests that there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support the use of cupping therapy on relevant diseases.
21078197:34	Although quite a number of clinical studies reported that cupping therapy may have effect on pain conditions, herpes zoster, symptoms of cough and asthma, acne, common cold, or other common diseases.
21078197:35	The current evidence is not sufficient to allow recommendation for clinical use of cupping therapy for the treatment of above diseases of any etiology in people of any age group.
21078197:36	The long-term effect of cupping therapy is not known, but use of cupping is generally safe based on long term clinical use and reports from the reviewed clinical studies.
21078197:37	The number of RCTs on treatment using cupping therapy is scarce in terms of a specific disease.
21078197:38	Existing trials are of small size and low methodological quality.
21078197:39	Further high quality studies of larger sample size are needed to assess the effectiveness of cupping therapy.
21078197:40	It might be worthwhile to examine the effectiveness of cupping therapy or combination of cupping therapy with other non-pharmacological or pharmacological treatments for pain conditions, herpes zoster, symptoms of cough and asthma, acne, common cold, or other common diseases which were most treated by cupping therapy according to this review.
21078197:41	In addition, the methodological quality should be improved, and the study design and report should also be standardized.
21078197:42	The protocol of the study should be registered in authoritative organizations , such as WHO International Clinical Trial Registration Platform (WHO ICTRP).

21799570:0	INTRODUCTION 
Adult population in Gujarat has HIV sero-prevalence of 0.37% putting the estimate of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA) at 1.37 lakhs (in 2009).
21799570:1	Timely instituted antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves the quality of life and increases the survival of PLHAs.
21799570:2	Improved access to HIV testing and counseling and ART together could significantly reduce infection rates.
21799570:3	Transmission rates can be as high as 10 times for a person who is not on ART (5.6 per 100 person years) than those who are (0.5 per 100 person years).
21799570:4	Currently Gujarat has 21 ART centers (ARTC), 29 link ART centers (LAC), and 14 community care centers (CCC), which have more than 19,000 patients “on ART.”
21799570:5	A gap still exists between those detected as HIV-positives and those who report on ARTC.
21799570:6	With so many patients joining at treatment, it becomes essential to ensure the regular compliance and drug adherence in them – most crucial aspect of this therapy.
21799570:7	Sexual, especially the heterosexual, transmission is the main driver of the epidemic in most of India, accounting for nearly 90% of nationwide prevalence.
21799570:8	In order to implement the desired intervention, the epidemiology of modes of transmission (HIV/AIDS) in a particular region has to be understood with regard to sociodemographic factors, level of awareness, as well as risk behavior of the population.
21799570:9	It is so because the effective approach for the prevention and control of infection/disease is through awareness generation and lifestyle changes.
21799570:10	This ARTC-based study was planned with the objective to find out profile of HIV-positives and association with sociodemographic determinants of modes of transmission.
21799570:11	Findings of this study may help in redesigning the strategy to bridge the gap between those detected and registered at ART centers.
21799570:12	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study data were gathered by five medical students of sixth semester of a teaching institute during Community Medicine posting.
21799570:13	First they underwent extensive training on various components of HIV/AIDS by the author (RS), later the performa was designed and pilot-tested at ARTC Mahesana during August 2009.
21799570:14	Later the performa was modified.
21799570:15	This pretested structured questionnaire was used on 132 clients at ARTC of Civil Hospital, Ahmadabad.
21799570:16	Clients receiving ART during September 2009 were interviewed after the prior approval from the institutional authorities and informed consent from clients.
21799570:17	Here 132 cases were selected serially for the duration of the posting of students.
21799570:18	Sample size was considered adequate to document the routes of acquiring infection and various sociodemographic factors.
21799570:19	Data were complied and analyzed in EPI INFO package.
21799570:20	OBSERVATIONS 
Out of total 132 patients, 79 (59.8%) were males, 52 (39.4%) females including 1 transgender.
21799570:21	All subjects were adults (> 15 years) and none of them gave history suggestive of mother-to-child transmission.
21799570:22	Majority were married (79.8%), literates (78%), urbanites (62%), and natives (59%) . One-fourth of them were housewives, 22% farmers, 4.5% truck drivers, 12.1% unemployed (including 1.5% students) . Half of them came to know their HIV status from VCTC (ICTC general), followed by physicians (28.8%) and rest from RNTCP (10.6%), PPTCT (6%), self-referral (3%), and accidentally detected (0.8%)  and 9.8% reached on ART without pre- and post-test counseling; large number informed their spouse (87.9%) and family (78.8%).
21799570:23	Among the couples, 55.3% were of discordant type  
Based on self-reporting, 78 (59%) clients acquired it by heterosexual and 5 (3.8%) by homosexual (man having sex with man); underreporting is possible as in 29 (22%) cases; counselors could not elicit the route of transmission  Sexual route needs to be targeted because 25–34 years age group accounted for 73.5% cases.
21799570:24	Further the contribution was more in females (73%) than males (50.6%).
21799570:25	Even alarming was the fact that among those infected by sexual route, half were unmarried.
21799570:26	Five persons who got infected from MSM relations include one transgender and two men above 55 years of age.
21799570:27	Blood transfusion was identified by 8 (6%); none of the unmarried acquired infection through this mode.
21799570:28	Injectable drug users were 12 (9%) and included both males (11.3%) and females (5.7%).
21799570:29	Out of six truck drivers five acquired it from heterosexual route and in case of one, counselor could not get information.
21799570:30	Up to SSC, there was not much difference but after HSC, proportion of clients decreased and decline was more obvious for heterosexual mode of transmission from 14.4% to 6%.
21799570:31	DISCUSSION 
Mean age of study subject (38.7+10.3 years) indicates a shift whereby younger persons are reporting at ART centers.
21799570:32	Presence of almost 40% female subjects on ART shows feminization of epidemic.
21799570:33	Globally women make up 50% of those affected, up from 41% just 6 years ago.
21799570:34	Proportion of subjects from sexually active age group (62%) was less than national figure of 89% for 20–49 years age group.
21799570:35	Males accessed ART services more than females in this study, which indicates some barriers preventing the access of females even now.
21799570:36	Better education helps to cope up with disease as shown by a Chennai-based study that patient with better education had significantly higher domain scores.
21799570:37	Present study found up to SSC proportion of clients as well as sexual route was almost same but for those educated up to HSC and above it came down.
21799570:38	The demographic profile of clients of VCTC attendees elsewhere was 64% males, 75% in the age group of 20–49 years, 80% currently married, 70% literates, 66% gainfully employed, one-fourth were housewives, 98% lived with families.
21799570:39	And 78 (59.1%) clients acquired it by sexual mode and one-fifth of them did not disclose their mode of transmission.
21799570:40	The route of transmission reported among HIV-positive male and female clients of ICTC is mainly heterosexual contact (77% and 79%, respectively).
21799570:41	Therefore for behavioral change communication (BCC) and effective positive prevention, it is essential to explore HRB of each and every client.
21799570:42	Another important bridge population is the long-route truck drivers of India; 70% of them have sexually transmitted infections and on an average they have 200 sexual encounters per year.
21799570:43	Therefore it was not surprising to find five out of six PLHA truck driver in this study to have acquired the infection through heterosexual route (remaining one did not mention the route).
21799570:44	Present study reinforces the need to work more intensively with this population.
21799570:45	The use of nonsterile injecting drug equipment is the principal driver of HIV epidemic in NE of India; 20 districts showed 5% or more HIV prevalence among IDUs in 2008–09 and is a critical in fuelling HIV epidemics among injecting drug users (IDU).
21799570:46	There were three women who acquired it by this mode, which is a matter of concern.
21799570:47	In BSS 2006, the proportion of respondents being aware of HIV transmission through needle sharing varied between 86% and 97%.
21799570:48	Survey in Chennai showed that 6.5% of MSM were HIV infected against 0.9% of heterosexual men.
21799570:49	A Mumbai study among MSM and transgender in the same year showed that 17% MSM and over 60% transgender were HIV-positive.
21799570:50	UNAIDS estimated that in 2005 only 9% of MSM had access to any type of HIV prevention program.
21799570:51	Out of five homosexual in our study, one was student, another one factory worker, and three were educated to SSC and above.
21799570:52	One-fifth clients in present study were from rural areas, which confirm that the epidemic is moving from urban to rural areas; better surveillance can explore more clients.
21799570:53	Migration itself is not a risk factor for HIV but the circumstances in which migration occurs increases vulnerability to infection.
21799570:54	In present study, the distribution of HIV was equal between migrants and locals; 13 (9.8%) clients were not counseled at all at ICTC – they may transmit this infection, may not adhere to treatment as they have not received the needed psychosocial support.
21799570:55	Blood transfusion is second established route of transmission after sexual route, which has reduced but is still around 2%, much lower than present study (6%).
21799570:56	Those who acquired it form blood route informed their spouse as well as family, while those who acquired it from sexual route did not inform to their spouse (7) and family (18).
21799570:57	Because of stigma associated with sexual route, a PLHA (infected through sexual route) finds it difficult to share HIV status with his/her spouse/family.
21799570:58	Same is not the case when it is acquired through blood route.
21799570:59	Presence of 28 discordant couples in the study can be due to the quality of counseling and adoption of safe sex and other preventive measures.
21799570:60	With successful intervention, this number can be increased further.
21799570:61	CONCLUSION 
All four modes of transmission were associated with typical epidemiological determinants and have impact on accessibility of preventive/curative services and treatment-seeking behavior.
21799570:62	It underscores the need for more skill and professional training to ART counselors so that they can create more awareness about safer sex and provide much needed psychological support to PLHAs for taking ART with needed drug adherence.
21799570:63	PLHAS are easily able to discuss their issues and share their identity which will also benefit the society through reduction in stigma and discrimination and the positive prevention.

19906700:0	INTRODUCTION 
Cancer is a genetic disease caused by the accumulation of deleterious modifications within the genome of somatic cells.
19906700:1	During tumorigenesis, genomic instability leads to the progressive acquisition of silent (‘passenger’) and selected (‘driver’) mutations.
19906700:2	The latter provide cancer cells with selective growth advantages that initiate clonal expansion.
19906700:3	The Cancer Genome Project (CGP) has the ambitious goal of identifying all genes that are implicated in the development of cancer.
19906700:4	The Cancer Gene Census (CGC) is a part of CGP and collects information on more than 370 genes whose mutations are causally related to cancer.
19906700:5	Recently, high-throughput mutational screenings of several cancer types have been promoted with the aim of identifying mutated genes, without any hypothesis-driven bias.
19906700:6	So far, four of these high-throughput experiments have been delivered.
19906700:7	Overall, they identified 380 Candidate Cancer Genes (CAN-genes) that are mutated in breast, colorectal, pancreatic cancers and glioblastoma.
19906700:8	Furthermore, the pilot experiment from the Tumor Sequencing Project identified 26 genes (TSP-genes) mutated in lung adenocarcinoma.
19906700:9	Altogether, these studies revealed that the number of cancer genes is surprisingly high and they are functionally more heterogeneous than previously thought.
19906700:10	Despite this functional heterogeneity, cancer genes tend to share ‘systems-level properties’, such as higher connectivity and lower duplicability when compared to the rest of human genes.
19906700:11	The presence of shared properties, which are not strictly dependent on the gene function, indicates that cancer genes are fragile components of the human gene repertoire.
19906700:12	A number of databases have been set up over the years to collect and organize several types of information related to cancer, such as somatic mutations of cancer genes, experimental evidence for their involvement in cancer or modifications in gene expression levels.
19906700:13	Other databases are specialized on particular types of cancer, on single genes or on specific genomic modifications.
19906700:14	None of the available resources, however, focuses on properties of cancer genes that are not strictly dependent on their function, but that could help in interpreting cancer as a ‘systems disease’.
19906700:15	Here, we present the Network of Cancer Genes (NCG, ), a database that stores information on systems-level properties of a comprehensive dataset of more than 730 cancer genes.
19906700:16	The collected features are duplicability, evolutionary appearance and topological properties in the human protein–protein interaction network.
19906700:17	Protein interactions have been successfully used to infer functional links between proteins.
19906700:18	In NCG, they are used to understand how the topological properties of the cancer proteins inside the protein–protein interaction network influence their role in cancer.
19906700:19	NCG can be used to retrieve information on specific cancer genes, as well as to identify groups of cancer genes with identical properties, thus providing a flexible tool for investigating the complex landscape of cancer genetic determinants.
19906700:20	In this paper, along with a general description of the features of NCG, we also provide a specific example of how NCG can be used by reporting the properties of PTEN a tumor suppressor gene coding for a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that is impaired in several cancer types.
19906700:21	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
FUTURE PROSPECTIVE 
In the coming years, we will assist to a continuous delivery of data from the Cancer Genome Project as well as from other large-scale mutational screenings of cancer genes.
19906700:22	This massive quantity of information will require ad hoc tools for data organization and mining.
19906700:23	NCG represents a first attempt in the direction of a systematic analysis of cancer genes, and it will be constantly updated and expanded with the delivery of new data.

21436883:0	Introduction 
About 70% of the 46 million smokers in the United States (US) desire to quit, with 3% of all smokers quitting and staying quit each year . Large decreases in smoking prevalence have, in part, been achieved through stronger tobacco control policies ; . Still, smoking remains a leading cause of premature death in the US and globally . 
Raising cigarette prices, typically via excise tax increases, may be the most effective tobacco control measure ; . Higher prices increase smoking cessation, prevent smoking initiation, and reduce the quantity smoked among continuing smokers .
21436883:1	However, tax avoidance undermines the public health effectiveness of cigarette taxes . Smokers seek out Internet cigarette vendors because their prices undercut brick and mortar retailers by selling from duty-free zones, low tax jurisdictions, or sovereign Indian reservations – .
21436883:2	Although used as a mechanism for tax avoidance, the Internet is also a popular venue for health promotion – .
21436883:3	An estimated 4.5% of all Internet searches are believed to be health-related and one in four smokers have sought cessation aid online . Professional internet-based cessation programs appear effective when users are enrolled in their services, although the impact of general information seeking on cessation is unclear – . 
On April 1, 2009 the US federal cigarette excise tax was increased from $0.39 to $1.01 (USD) per pack under congress' reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
21436883:4	Ideally, the “SCHIP tax” would lead to more cessation attempts with limited tax avoidance.
21436883:5	However, the price increases may be avoided by buying cigarettes online–thereby undermining cessation attempts.
21436883:6	This report presents an early examination of the SCHIP tax's impact on information-seeking behavior in the form of cessation and tax avoidance queries to an online search engine using a real-time, free and public surveillance alternative.
21436883:7	Other state specific cigarette excise taxes that occurred near the SCHIP tax were investigated to further validate the methods used for the SCHIP evaluation and consider how taxes interact when occurring in sequence, as they typically do, rather than in isolation.
21436883:8	Materials and Methods 
Traditional surveillance techniques are ill equipped to identify timely temporal and spatial health trends for public health and medical professionals, policy makers, and the public who influence policy choices.
21436883:9	An alternative method is to monitor real-time search query behavior – . Google search queries related to smoking cessation, e.g. “quit smoking,” and attempts to avoid cigarette taxes, e.g. “cheap cigarettes,” were analyzed around the time of the federal SCHIP, and two recent state specific tax increases by comparing across geographies with and without a tax increase.
21436883:10	Florida's July 1, 2009 $0.34–1.34
21436883:11	tax increase and New York's June 3, 2008 $1.50–2.75 increase were purposefully selected to demonstrate trends related to state-specific tax increases occurring before (New York) or after (Florida) the SCHIP tax.
21436883:12	Data were obtained from Google Insights for Search, a public, free and real-time monitoring of Google search queries.
21436883:13	This tool produces relative search volume (RSV) indicators scaled to the highest search proportion week (RSV = 100) with lesser values demonstrating how other proportions compared to the highest proportion.
21436883:14	For example, if during the highest search proportion week 400 of every 1,000,000 searches were related to cessation this would be RSV = 100.
21436883:15	For another week, if 200 of every 1,000,000 searches were related to cessation this would be RSV = 50, interpreted as 50% of the highest search proportion.
21436883:16	RSV indirectly corrects for variation in population size and Internet access, where both are increasing during the study period and would bias any absolute search volume measure.
21436883:17	Results 
The $0.39–1.01
21436883:18	federal SCHIP tax increase was associated with immediate sharp peaks for smoking cessation and tax avoidance searches in the US indicative of anticipation of and responses to the tax.
21436883:19	In Canada, where no similar tax took effect, there was virtually no change in cessation or tax avoidance searches around the time of or after the SCHIP tax.
21436883:20	In the US, smoking cessation RSV increased by a factor of 11.8% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 5.7 to 17.9; p<.001) of the highest RSV comparing differences of differences from the pre-period, weeks 14 through 52 in 2008, with Canada.
21436883:21	However, cessation searches quickly abated and approximated the differences from pre-tax levels in Canada during the post period (−0.1; 95%CI, −3.4 to 3.0; p<.904).
21436883:22	Tax avoidance searches, on the other hand, increased more and remained higher for longer, than cessation searches.
21436883:23	Tax avoidance RSV was 27.9% (95%CI, 15.9 to 39.9; p<.001) and 5.3% (95%CI, 3.6 to 7.1; p<.001) statistically significantly higher during the implementation and post periods, although searches were dissipating in the later portion of the post period.
21436883:24	Moreover, if we extend our analysis backwards to include all related searches since 2004, tax avoidance searches reached an all-time peak in the entire US during the SCHIP tax implementation [not shown graphically] . 
Discussion 
Smoking cessation and tax avoidance searches peaked around the time the SCHIP tax took effect, suggesting both anticipation of, and responsiveness to, the tax.
21436883:25	Smoking cessation searches quickly dissipated to pre-tax levels three weeks after the tax, although, interest in avoiding cigarette taxes almost doubled three weeks to months after the tax, than in the months preceding the tax.
21436883:26	These suggest the SCHIP tax was immediately effective at promoting cessation but was more strongly associated with tax avoidance in the longer term.
21436883:27	Analysis of two state-specific cigarette tax increases in Florida and New York largely corroborated the SCHIP trends and suggest plausible interaction between tax increases across geographies.
21436883:28	For example, the SCHIP tax was associated with larger increases in cessation and avoidance searches in New York, than the overall national estimates, where a recent state tax had already elevated cigarette prices and only 12 weeks after the SCHIP tax Florida's state specific tax increase was associated with unique increases in avoidance and cessation searches over differences from the SCHIP tax.

null:0	Introduction 
Epidemiological studies provide strong evidence of a role for endogenous sex hormone levels in the aetiology of breast cancer  and suggest that levels may be partly genetically determined.
null:1	Quantification of hormone levels in premenopausal women, however, is difficult because of their cyclical nature.
null:2	In particular, oestrogen has a marked peak in the follicular phase and a further wider peak in the luteal phase.
null:3	Methods 
We developed a protocol to capture peak follicular phase urinary oestrone glucuronide (E1G), and luteal phase E1G in healthy premenopausal women.
null:4	Repeated measurements of creatinine-adjusted E1G levels, in 789 women, were used to describe features of the E1G curve such as mean and peak follicular E1G, and luteal E1G.
null:5	A total of 691 tagging SNPs capturing common variation in genes within the oestrogen synthesis and metabolism pathways were successfully genotyped.
null:6	Geometric mean urinary E1G levels and endogenous plasma hormone levels were estimated and tested for an association with the genotype of each SNP.
null:7	Results 
We identified a rare SNP (minor allele frequency 7%), in which the minor allele was associated with a 20% reduction in circulating levels of E1G in healthy premenopausal women ( P < 10 -8).
null:8	We are currently genotyping this SNP in 12,000 breast cancer cases and 12,000 controls to test whether the reduction in circulating oestrogen levels is also associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk.
null:9	Conclusions 
Circulating hormone levels in premenopausal women may provide a useful intermediate phenotype in the search for low-penetrance breast cancer risk alleles.
19889804:0	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Data from 100 Caucasians of the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program were analyzed.
19889804:1	Subjects underwent measurements at baseline and after 9 months of lifestyle intervention (≥3 h of moderate sports per week, intake of calories from fat <30%, intake of fibers ≥15 g/1,000 kcal, intake of saturated fat ≤10%).
19889804:2	Informed written consent was obtained from all participants, and an ethics committee approved the protocol.
19889804:3	Body fat was measured by bioelectrical impedance, total and visceral fat by magnetic resonance tomography, and liver fat by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
19889804:4	Insulin sensitivity was estimated from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as proposed by Matsuda and DeFronzo [10,000/√(Ins mean · Gluc mean · Ins 0 · Gluc 0)] and additionally measured by the euglycemic clamp.
19889804:5	The fatty acids in the plasma FFA fraction were measured as previously described (supplemental Table 1 in the online appendix at ).
19889804:6	Forward stepwise multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed.
19889804:7	RESULTS 
Subject characteristics are shown in supplemental Table 2.
19889804:8	At baseline, insulin sensitivity correlated inversely with body weight, BMI, waist circumference, total body fat, visceral fat, and liver fat (all P < 0.0001).
19889804:9	Total fasting FFA levels were lower in males ( P = 0.0002).
19889804:10	They were not associated with age or with measures of adiposity, liver fat (all adjusted P > 0.09), or insulin sensitivity (OGTT: F ratio = 0.6, P = 0.42; clamp: F ratio = 0.7; P = 0.40) independently of sex, age, and body fat.
19889804:11	Circulating palmitoleate was lower in males (4.38 ± 0.19 vs. 5.03 ± 0.14%, P = 0.007) and not associated with age, or with measures of adiposity such as body weight, BMI, waist circumference, or total and visceral fat, adjusted for sex and age (all P > 0.23).
19889804:12	Because palmitoleate in serum cholesteryl esters correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, we also investigated the relationship between circulating palmitoleate and adjusted hsCRP levels.
19889804:13	No significant relationship was found ( P = 0.44).
19889804:14	A weak negative correlation between palmitoleate and liver fat was observed after adjustment for age, sex, and body fat ( F ratio = 3.7; P = 0.057).
19889804:15	In contrast, palmitoleate correlated positively with insulin sensitivity (OGTT: F Ratio = 8.2, A ; clamp: F ratio = 7.8, B ) independently of sex, age, and body fat.
19889804:16	Additional adjustment for visceral fat only moderately affected these relationships ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.019).
19889804:17	During the 9 months of lifestyle intervention, insulin sensitivity and circulating palmitoleate increased ( P < 0.0001, supplemental Tables 1 and 2).
19889804:18	Change in palmitoleate did not correlate with changes in insulin sensitivity in all subjects ( n = 95, OGTT P = 0.67, and n = 38, clamp P = 0.56).
19889804:19	However, a positive relationship was observed in subjects in the upper tertile of insulin sensitivity (OGTT) at baseline ( r = 0.41, P = 0.03), suggesting that in subjects starting with low insulin sensitivity, the multiple benefits of lifestyle interaction such as reduction in adiposity or increased exercise intensity have a stronger impact on insulin sensitivity than change in palmitoleate levels.
19889804:20	In agreement with the analyses at baseline, at the follow-up visit, palmitoleate levels also correlated positively with adjusted insulin sensitivity ( n = 95, OGTT: F ratio = 5.0; P = 0.029).
19889804:21	In forward stepwise linear regression analyses including palmitoleate at baseline, age, sex, insulin sensitivity at baseline, and body fat at baseline and at follow-up, high palmitoleate levels predicted a larger increase in insulin sensitivity ( P = 0.02, supplemental Table 3).
19889804:22	After dividing subjects into tertiles by the observed change in insulin sensitivity, for 1-SD increase in circulating palmitoleate at baseline, the odds ratio of subjects for being in the highest versus the lowest tertile of change in insulin sensitivity was 2.35 (95% CI 1.16–5.35).
19889804:23	CONCLUSIONS 
We found that circulating palmitoleate was a determinant of insulin sensitivity both estimated from the OGTT and measured by the clamp.
19889804:24	Furthermore, in subjects with high palmitoleate at baseline, there was a higher chance to observe an increase in insulin sensitivity, independently of the change in adiposity, compared with subjects with low levels.
19889804:25	These novel data strongly support that palmitoleate may also be involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity in humans.
19889804:26	In animals, palmitoleate infusion decreased expression of hepatic lipogenic enzymes, thus possibly regulating liver fat, an important determinant of insulin sensitivity in humans.
19889804:27	We observed a weak negative relationship between circulating palmitoleate and liver fat, suggesting that, in humans, the effects of palmitoleate on the regulation of insulin sensitivity may be more pronounced than on hepatic steatosis.
19889804:28	What mechanisms are involved in the determination of circulating palmitoleate?
19889804:29	The lipid chaperons fatty acid–binding protein (FABP)-4 and -5 were found to suppress the biosynthesis of palmitoleate.
19889804:30	FABPs induce lipolysis in adipocytes and inflammatory pathways in macrophages, particularly in visceral obesity.
19889804:31	However, FABP expression was not elevated in visceral obesity and, in the present study, palmitoleate levels did not correlate with visceral fat mass, suggesting that increase in this fat compartment does not appreciably determine palmitoleate levels.
19889804:32	Another regulator of palmitoleate may be diet.
19889804:33	However, dietary levels of palmitoleate are very low.
19889804:34	Therefore, palmitoleate levels are most probably not largely affected by the diet, but mainly by de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue.
19889804:35	In addition, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of palmitoleate from palmitate, may determine palmitoleate levels.
19889804:36	This is supported by data showing that thiazolidinedione treatment increased insulin sensitivity, circulating palmitoleate, and expression and activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 in adipose tissue.
19889804:37	In conclusion, particularly the cross-sectional analyses with measurements of insulin sensitivity from both the OGTT and the clamp suggest that palmitoleate strongly and independently of adiposity determines insulin sensitivity.
19889804:38	Therefore, circulating palmitoleate may also play an important role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in humans.

21655173:0	Introduction 
Primary renal lymphoma (PRL) is rare.
21655173:1	Kidneys are also an uncommon primary extranodal lymphoma (ENL) location.
21655173:2	Middle aged and elderly people are mostly affected with an incidence of 0.7% among all cases of ENL.
21655173:3	Pathogenesis is unclear and treatment of PRL is ambiguous.
21655173:4	Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific nature of manifestations.
21655173:5	Early detection therefore depends on combination of computed tomographic scan and examination of adequate biopsy material.
21655173:6	We describe a child who presented to pediatric and then to nephrology units with low-grade pyrexia, severe loss of weight, and bilateral kidney swelling.
21655173:7	Case Report 
A seven-year old girl presented to emergency room with 5 months history of intermittent fever, joint pain, severe anemia, and distended abdomen.
21655173:8	She was treated outside by alternative medicine (‘naturopathy’) based on severe diet restrictions consisting of few pieces of bread and vegetables for several months.
21655173:9	She was also misdiagnosed, hence treated wrongly as a case of congestive heart failure.
21655173:10	Bilateral renal enlargement was mistaken for congested hepatosplenomegaly.
21655173:11	No proper evaluation for abdominal distention was made at this time.
21655173:12	At admission to our hospital, physical examination revealed an emaciated child with severe anemia and bilateral palpable kidneys.
21655173:13	Clinically they were symmetrical, non-cystic, and non-tender.
21655173:14	Routine laboratory evaluation showed a blood urea nitrogen level of 16 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, and uric acid was 7.8 mg/dl.
21655173:15	Creatinine clearance was 52 ml per minute.
21655173:16	Her hemoglobin was 3.2 g/dl, total leukocyte count 7900/mm 3, and platelet count 2.53 × 10 4/mm 3.
21655173:17	Peripheral smear showed moderate anisocytosis with macrocytes, polychromatic cells, normocytes, and few microcytic normochromic cells suggesting hemolytic anemia.
21655173:18	Reticulocyte count was 4.5 percent.
21655173:19	Serum calcium was 10.2 mg/dl, phosphorous 3.1 mg/dl, and uric acid 9.8 mg/dl.
21655173:20	Liver function tests were normal.
21655173:21	The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 38 mm/h and C-reactive protein was 1.4 mg/dl.
21655173:22	Tuberculin skin test and serological assays for EB virus and virus were negative.
21655173:23	Serum compliment and quantitative estimation of immuno-globulins were non-contributory.
21655173:24	Urinalysis revealed trace protein but no active sediments.
21655173:25	Repeated urine cytology revealed no malignant cells.
21655173:26	Ultrasound of abdomen revealed marked bilateral renal enlargement with homogenous cortical echogenicity.
21655173:27	The kidneys measured 17.9 × 6.8 × 7.1 and 16.6 × 6.8 × 7.1 cm.
21655173:28	There was mild hepatomegaly without evidence of any focal lesion.
21655173:29	Intrahepatic vascular and biliary radicles were normal.
21655173:30	A plain computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen confirmed bilateral diffused renal enlargement with decreased attenuation suggestive of diffuse infiltrative disease.
21655173:31	There was mild hepatomegaly but no evidence of hydronephrosis or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy . Chest X-ray showed normal lung parenchyma and a normal size heart without any mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which was confirmed by CT scan.
21655173:32	Percutaneous renal biopsy showed extensive infiltration of interstitium by monomorphic neoplastic cells, some of which were round with round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm.
21655173:33	Tumor cells were arranged in a tubular pattern at places.
21655173:34	Tumor infiltration was found confined to interstitium without involving glomeruli or tubule [Figure and ].
21655173:35	CD45 showed surface positivity in all cells . Bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable, as were the head and chest CT scans.
21655173:36	In view of angulation of all nucleoli, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (maltoma), a form of PRL was entertained.
21655173:37	She was put on combination chemotherapy consisting cyclophosphamide, intravenous vincristine 2 mg/M 2and shifted to a medical oncology unit where she was started on combination chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone).
21655173:38	She developed serious leucopenia (total leukocyte count of 900/cmm) on sixth postchemotherapy day, needing temporary suspension of therapy and institution of broad spectrum antibiotics.
21655173:39	Discussion 
Bilateral symmetrical renal enlargement can be due to bilateral hydronephrosis, cystic diseases, or due to malignant or benign infiltrative diseases.
21655173:40	Rarely, it can occur in bilateral renal vein thrombosis.
21655173:41	However, these conditions were easily ruled out on the basis of clinical features, ultrasonogram, and CT scan.
21655173:42	CT scan showed diffuse enlargement of kidneys.
21655173:43	Wilms’ tumor is seen in about 5% of children involving both kidneys; generally renal enlargement is asymmetric and imaging techniques would show tumor attenuation different from renal parenchyma.
21655173:44	Other renal tumors were similarly ruled out.
21655173:45	Acute phase reactant levels were normal and immunological parameters were negative, suggesting malignancy as the diagnosis.
21655173:46	Normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels indicating absence of significant renal dysfunction in this case was rather surprising finding in view of bilateral diffuse extensive involvement of both kidneys.
21655173:47	However, her creatinine clearance was decreased to 52 ml per minute.
21655173:48	Hydronephrosis due to obstruction of renal pedicles or pelvis by lymphnode enlargement was ruled out by ultrasonogram.
21655173:49	As has been stated earlier, PRL is a rare disease hence poses difficulty in diagnosis.
21655173:50	Less than 100 cases of PRL have been reported in the literature, many of whom were not investigated by imaging and bone marrow biopsy to rule out extra renal disease.
21655173:51	On the other hand, there is considerable doubt among pathologists over development of lymphoma, because kidneys do not have identifiable lymphatic channels.
21655173:52	Some pathologists tend to think PRL is a disseminated malignancy, because in 10 to 20% of cases lymphoma affects both kidneys, as was in the present case.
21655173:53	Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue renal lymphoma is probably the underlying mechanism.
21655173:54	The imaging morphology of PRL can be variable from unilateral to bilateral single or multiple masses, diffuse parenchymal infiltration.
21655173:55	Contrast-enhanced CT scan is ideal test is useful, but was avoided in her case for potential risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, as her glomerular filtration rate was low (52 ml/mt) and due to unavailability of consent from her parents.
21655173:56	Diagnosis was made on the basis of histology and immunohistochemistry.
21655173:57	Fine needle aspiration or core renal biopsy clearly is the best method to establish diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity.
21655173:58	Treatment of PRL remains controversial because pathogenetic mechanisms are uncertain.
21655173:59	Role of radiation as a therapy in treatment of bilateral diffuse lymphoma infiltration is not established.
21655173:60	It is equally unclear if it should be only treated by chemotherapy or in combination with radiation.
21655173:61	Lack of therapeutic trials in literature has obviously compelled clinicians to adopt a practical approach and treat according to histological grade.
21655173:62	As it has been established that most cases of PRL are high-grade lymphoma mainly of B-cell phenotype, they are treated by CHOP or other chemotherapy regimen with or without radiotherapy.
21655173:63	However, results are unsatisfactory due to rapid progression of disease and treatment resistance.
21655173:64	Recently, rituximab has been added to CHOP regime which is expected to improve the outcome of PRL of B-cell origin; although, therapy of PRL will remain empirical in the absence of large multicenter or multinational trials.
21655173:65	In conclusion, PRL should be suspected if there is bilateral enlargement of the kidneys.
21655173:66	Modern imaging techniques and renal histology have a central role in establishing the diagnosis.
null:0	Introduction 
Several methods have been proposed to estimate myocardial motion from those based on the prior extraction of the tagging pattern to methods based on spatial phases .
null:1	Among several, the HARP method is one of the most popular methods of the latter group.
null:2	Recently, an alternative method has been proposed: SinMod.
null:3	It is however very difficult to objectively compare the accuracy of the methods.
null:4	Purpose 
The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology to evaluate concurrently methods for estimating motion displacement fields from 2D tagged-MR image sequences.
null:5	Methods 
We propose to evaluate the accuracy of the methods on realistic simulated tagged-MRI sequences.
null:6	A simple kinematic mode based model of the heart deformation in the small axis plane continuously warps a true tagged-MR image at end-diastole to provide a whole cycle simulated sequence.
null:7	Various conditions can be varied from the models’ parameters to additive image noise, leading to a set of simulate sequences with various properties.
null:8	Five sequences were simulated with increasing motion complexity from simple thickening (30%), rotation (10,20deg) to more realistic deformations without and with local anomaly.
null:9	Then, estimation was carried out with the SinMod  (integrated into inTag OsiriX plugin) method.
null:10	Thanks to the known motion, error indices were quantified between estimated and true dense motion fields as point wise displacement orientation and magnitude discrepancies.
null:11	Global as well as phase by phase error statistics are delivered through error images and box and whiskers graphs.
null:12	Results 
With the thickening sequence, mean magnitude error is less than 0.5 pixels for all the phases.
null:13	Angular shift error is in average less than 4deg with equivalent deviation.
null:14	For the sequence with 10deg rotation, mean magnitude and angular errors remain less than 0.5pix and 8deg (median), respectively.
null:15	Generally, errors are higher at end-systole.
null:16	These values are significantly higher with the 20deg rotation sequence with up to 24deg and 8pix at late phases due to very large displacements into the myocardium.
null:17	For the realistic sequences, the median magnitude error is systematically less than 1pix but angular shift reached 16deg.
null:18	Similar results are obtained with the pathological case.
null:19	Conclusions 
This simulation based approach allows to finely compare method’s accuracy and highlight their respective strengths and weaknesses.

16504043:0	Background 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a disorder characterized by massive systemic intravascular activation of coagulation, leading to widespread deposition of fibrin in the circulation which can compromise the blood supply to various organs, thus contributing to multiple organ failure.
16504043:1	At the same time, the consumption of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding[ - ].
16504043:2	However, DIC is not a disease itself but is always secondary to an underlying disorder . In fact, a variety of clinical conditions may cause systemic activation of coagulation.
16504043:3	Table lists the diseases most frequently associated with DIC.
16504043:4	Bacterial infections, in particular septicemia, are the most common clinical conditions associated with DIC.
16504043:5	There is no difference in the incidence of DIC in patients with Gram-negative or Gram-positive sepsis.
16504043:6	Systemic infections by other micro-organisms, such as viruses and parasites, may also lead to DIC.
16504043:7	The generalized activation of coagulation occurring in these cases is mediated by cell membrane components of micro-organisms (lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin) or bacterial exotoxins, such as staphylococcal α hemolysin, which cause a generalized inflammatory response through the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ - ].
16504043:8	Severe trauma and burns are other conditions frequently associated with DIC . Both solid and hematologic cancers may be associated with DIC, which can complicate up to 15 percent of cases of metastasized tumors or acute leukemia [ - ].
16504043:9	DIC is also a frequent complication (occurring in more than 50 percent of cases) of some obstetric conditions such as abruptio placentae and amniotic fluid embolism .
16504043:10	Finally, selected vascular disorders, such as giant hemangiomas and large aortic aneurysms, and severe toxic or immunological reactions (snake bites, drugs, hemolytic transfusion reactions and transplant rejection) can be associated with DIC . 
In the following sections we briefly discuss the current knowledge on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of DIC.
16504043:11	Conclusion 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a syndrome characterized by systemic intravascular activation of coagulation leading to bleeding (due to depletion of platelets and coagulation factors) and thrombosis(due to widespread deposition of fibrin in the circulation).
16504043:12	The diagnosis of DIC is usually made by a combination of routinely available laboratory tests, using a validated diagnostic algorithm.
16504043:13	In recent years, the mechanisms involved in pathological microvascular fibrin deposition in DIC have become progressively clear, resulting in novel preventive and therapeutic approaches to patients with DIC.
20504306:0	Background 
The influenza A and B viruses are common respiratory pathogens, with estimated annual global attack rates of 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children . Seasonal influenza can be a severe disease.
20504306:1	It has been estimated that in Europe between 40,000 and 220,000 excess deaths per year can be attributed to influenza, depending on the pathogenicity of the circulating virus . Seasonal influenza affects all age groups, but the highest incidence of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality is seen in children aged 0-23 months and in adults over 65 years of age . In the USA, influenza-associated deaths range between 30 and 150 per 100,000 individuals aged over 65 years , and it is estimated that ~90% of deaths due to seasonal influenza occur among people aged ≥ 65 years [ , ].
20504306:2	Annual vaccination continues to be the primary preventive measure against seasonal influenza.
20504306:3	The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccination of people at high risk of severe influenza or associated complications, including elderly people . The seasonal influenza vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing influenza-like illness confirmed by laboratory tests and influenza-associated morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups [ - ].
20504306:4	However, the immune response to the vaccine is lower in the elderly than in younger healthy adults , due to a decline in immune function with age ('immunosenescence') . 
To compensate for the effects of immunosenescence, vaccines for elderly people must be adapted to optimise the immune responses to vaccination.
20504306:5	Several approaches have been investigated, including use of an adjuvant , increasing the doses of antigens (e.g. 60 μg haemagglutinin [HA] of each component compared with the standard 15-μg dose) , and using new routes of administration.
20504306:6	Several studies have looked at ways to improve immune responses to vaccination by delivering vaccine via the intradermal route rather than the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes . The dermis has several unique properties that allow generation of powerful immune responses.
20504306:7	In particular, it contains resident and blood-derived dendritic cells.
20504306:8	These have an important role in the capture and presentation of antigens to the cells of the adaptive immune system; it also has a rich supply of blood and lymphatic vessels, allowing circulation of immune cells . Studies with vaccines against a number of diseases such as hepatitis B and rabies have demonstrated that intradermal delivery can be an effective alternative route for vaccination . 
Intanza ® 15 μg (also known in some countries as IDflu ® 15 μg) is the first intradermal influenza vaccine to be licensed for use in elderly people (>60 years of age); it received marketing authorisation in the European Union in 2009 for use in adults 60 years of age or older.
20504306:9	Consistent with the WHO recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccines, it contains each of one A/H1N1 strain, one A/H3N2 strain, and one B strain . Clinical studies in elderly people have shown that Intanza 15 μg is more immunogenic than the standard intramuscular vaccine . 
The present study was the first to compare the immunogenicity of this intradermal vaccine with that of a licensed adjuvanted influenza vaccine that was also developed to increase immune responses in the elderly .
20504306:10	The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that Intanza 15 μg is at least as immunogenic for the three virus strains as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine delivered via the intramuscular route in elderly volunteers.
20504306:11	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
This study showed that, in elderly volunteers, the immunogenicity of the intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine is largely comparable with that of the adjuvanted influenza vaccine.
20504306:12	The two vaccines induced similar levels of anti-HA antibodies as assessed by the SRH method.
20504306:13	Non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine compared with the adjuvanted vaccine was demonstrated for the A/H1N1 and B strains with the HI method and for all three strains with the SRH method.
20504306:14	Both vaccines satisfied the EMA immunogenicity criteria for influenza vaccines in the elderly.
20504306:15	Both vaccines were developed to address the challenge of immunosenescence.
20504306:16	The aim of the adjuvant in the seasonal influenza vaccine is to increase the immunogenicity in elderly people , whereas this intradermal vaccine reaches the same goal by reliably delivering the vaccine into the rich immune environment of the dermis a using a micro-needle injection system [ , ].
20504306:17	The HI assay is the most widely used for surveillance of the influenza virus and for assessing responses to vaccines in clinical trials . The HI and SRH methods provide serological correlates of protection , and are recognised by the EMA for the evaluation of influenza vaccines . The good agreement between the results from the HI and SRH tests for the A strains reported previously  was also observed in the present study because the results from both tests were comparable for the A strains for both vaccines.
20504306:18	Results from the SRH assay satisfied all three EMA immunogenicity criteria for both vaccines, whereas the HI assay results satisfied only the GMTR criterion, confirming the higher sensitivity of the SRH assay for influenza B strains . 
Due to the epidemiology of influenza and vaccination programmes in industrialised countries, few elderly people are seronegative to circulating seasonal influenza antigens . Beyer et al. demonstrated that pre-vaccination antibody titres can have an important influence on the results of immunogenicity studies with influenza vaccines (e.g. underestimation of antibody responses) . They proposed that post-vaccination results should be adjusted according to individual pre-vaccination titres so as to provide a more informative measure of serological responses to influenza vaccines . In the present study, baseline GMTs for all strains (but particularly the A/H3N2 strain) were slightly lower in the intradermal vaccine group than in the adjuvanted vaccine group.
20504306:19	Although the A/H3N2 strain failed to meet the criterion for non-inferiority when assessed by the HI method in the primary analysis, the post - hoc covariance analysis to adjust for pre-vaccination anti-HA titres demonstrated that the intradermal vaccine was non-inferior to the adjuvanted vaccine for all three virus strains assessed by the HI method.
20504306:20	In general, the intradermal and adjuvanted vaccines were well tolerated, with comparable proportions of participants reporting solicited systemic reactions in the two groups.
20504306:21	The two vaccines were also comparable according to the EMA criteria for the safety of influenza vaccines.
20504306:22	The micro-needle injection system used to deliver Intanza 15 μg has advantages over the adjuvanted vaccine from the perspective of local safety.
20504306:23	The needle penetrates only 1.5 mm into the skin, so the risk of damage to nerves or veins inherent with intramuscular injection is eliminated . The increased rate of injection-site erythema compared with intramuscular vaccination has been reported in studies with this intradermal vaccine in elderly volunteers . The injection of vaccine just below the skin surface means that local reactions are more readily and more frequently visible than after injection of vaccine deeper into the muscle even if the symptoms ere mainly mild and of short duration[ , ].
20504306:24	Importantly, injection-site reactions in the intradermal group were not associated with a higher incidence or severity of injection-site pain, and most reactions lasted for ≤ 3 days.
20504306:25	Conclusion 
The present study demonstrated that the immunogenicity and safety of a new intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine for use in the elderly, Intanza 15 μg, is largely comparable with that of the adjuvanted vaccine that has been licensed for use in elderly people in Europe for several years.
20504306:26	Thus, intradermal vaccination to target the immune properties of the skin appears to be an appropriate strategy to address the challenge of declining immune responses in the elderly.

16483372:0	Background 
Lots of controversies are raised about the optimal gestational age for twin delivery.
16483372:1	Whether multiple pregnancy has an adverse effect or not on fetal lung maturity remains very debatable.
16483372:2	Luke et al [1] suggested that twins attain more rapid pulmonary maturation than singletons and therefore complications of postmaturity may arise sooner in twins than in singletons.
16483372:3	This has been also ascertained by the study of Leveno et al [2], and referred to in the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists since 1989 [3].
16483372:4	This has resulted in a tendency to electively deliver twins earlier than singletons of comparable gestational age.
16483372:5	Hack et al have found an association between elective delivery and adverse perinatal outcome, in particular respiratory morbidity [4].
16483372:6	This was also reported by Wax et al in 2002 [5].
16483372:7	Friedman et al[6] recently reported that twins do not have accelerated maturation compared with singletons for the same gestational age.
16483372:8	Complications related to twin pregnancy and delivery are enormous.
16483372:9	Our local statistics point to an incidence of 1.4% for twin gestations.
16483372:10	With the recent introduction of assisted reproduction techniques, the number seems to be increasing.
16483372:11	Perinatal mortality is known to be approximately seven times higher in twins than singletons [8].
16483372:12	Many of these complications are related to preterm delivery, low birth weight, and respiratory problems [9].
16483372:13	This issue is furthermore complicated in developing countries, where the level of neonatal intensive care is not optimal.
16483372:14	The fact that, complications of prematurity and low birth weights are more common in these set-ups,[10] further complicates the decision.
16483372:15	The question about outcome in twins delivered early versus late remains unanswered [11].
16483372:16	However, a better understanding of the relationship between timing of delivery and perinatal outcome in local set-ups could be used to decrease the morbidity, mortality associated with twin deliveries [12].
16483372:17	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of the timing of delivering twins and the outcome.
16483372:18	We planned a study to test the perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies delivered at 36–37 weeks' gestation and twin pregnancies delivered at ≥ 38 weeks' gestation.
16483372:19	Methods 
This observational cohort study was carried-out at El-Chatby Maternity Hospital, University of Alexandria, Egypt.
16483372:20	El-Chatby hospital is a busy maternity hospital with a large number of deliveries approaching 10,000 per year.
16483372:21	Twin deliveries between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002, with gestational age at delivery at least 36 completed weeks, were included.
16483372:22	Exclusion criteria were significant maternal chronic ill health not related to pregnancy, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, congenital anomalies and the death of one fetus.
16483372:23	The protocol was approved by the University board.
16483372:24	Patient information was abstracted from the maternal and infants' charts.
16483372:25	Maternal data (last menstrual period, delivery indication and the presence of complications as oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, fetal distress, placental abruption or others) and newborn data (gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, need for resuscitation, need for intensive care admission and clinical course if admitted i.e. complications and outcome) were collected.
16483372:26	Respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed if respiratory distress was associated with the classic X-ray findings.
16483372:27	Hypoglycemia was considered if random blood glucose level was < 40 mg/dl.
16483372:28	The diagnosis of neonatal sepsis necessitated a positive blood culture in the presence of suggestive clinical signs.
16483372:29	Oligohydramnios was determined by sonographic examination (amniotic fluid index of ≤ 5) [13].
16483372:30	Maternal hypertension with proteinuria or edema were used to diagnose preeclampsia.
16483372:31	Fetal distress, antepartum or intrapartum, was defined according to the international standards [14].
16483372:32	Truly elective deliveries were defined as those that were not spontaneous or complicated with preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction (FGR) or abruption.
16483372:33	Gestational age at delivery was defined as the number of completed weeks from the first day of the last normal menstrual period to the date of delivery.
16483372:34	Early ultrasound examination (less than 20 weeks) results were used if the dates were unreliable.
16483372:35	FGR was considered if the fetal weight is below the 10th percentile of gestational age [15].
16483372:36	Perinatal outcomes were compared between twin gestation delivered at < 38 weeks' gestation and those delivered at ≥ 38 weeks' gestation.
16483372:37	Chi-square test student's t -test and were used for the analysis.
16483372:38	P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
16483372:39	Results 
During the 2-year study period, there were 18794 deliveries and 273 twin sets (1.45%).
16483372:40	Out of the 273 sets, 197 (72.2%) met the inclusion criteria.
16483372:41	Classified according to the gestational age at delivery, 115 sets (58.4%) were born at 36–<37 weeks[Group I], 66 (33.5%) at 37–<39 weeks [Group II] and 16 (8.1%) at > 39 weeks [Group III].
16483372:42	Table summarizes the data and the perinatal outcome of these three groups.
16483372:43	Lower birth weight, and the need for neonatal intensive care were significantly present in groups I and II compared to group III.
16483372:44	FGR was pronounced in group I compared to group III.
16483372:45	Respiratory distress, sepsis and hypoglycemia were more frequently encountered in newborns of group I.
16483372:46	In group II, their incidence was comparable to that of group III.
16483372:47	Maternal complications (preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, fetal distress and placental abruption) were significantly higher in group I than group III.
16483372:48	Though their incidence in group II was higher than in group III, yet the difference was not significant.
16483372:49	Eighty-eight sets have undergone elective deliveries for various causes.
16483372:50	Table summarizes the perinatal outcome of the twin sets according to the type of delivery (elective versus spontaneous).
16483372:51	The birth weights and Apgar score were comparable, but FGR, the need for intensive care and the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome were significantly higher in the newborns of the elective group.
16483372:52	All the outcome parameters were significantly higher in mothers of the elective group.
16483372:53	When the elective group was classified by gestational age into early and late deliveries, no significant difference was found in all the perinatal outcome parameters.
16483372:54	(Table ).
16483372:55	Discussion 
The confusion, created by the belief that fetal lung maturity occurs several weeks earlier in twins compared with uncomplicated matched singletons [2], led to the widespread impression that twins mature sooner than the singletons counterpart.
16483372:56	Moreover, the demonstration of advanced placental maturation in twins supported that impression [16].
16483372:57	All that encouraged the practice of delivering twins earlier.
16483372:58	In our study, the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was significantly higher at 36–37 weeks' gestation.
16483372:59	It decreased and disappeared at higher gestational ages.
16483372:60	Our findings go along with the findings of Friedman et al; who reported that twins < 36 weeks' gestation did not show accelerated maturation or improved neonatal outcome compared with their singletons counterpart [6].
16483372:61	The studies of Luke et al and Kiely et al suggested that Contrary FGR increases in twins after 38 weeks' gestation [1,17].
16483372:62	In our series, the incidence of FGR significantly decreased as the gestational age at delivery advanced.
16483372:63	This might be explained by the fact that complicated pregnancies with FGR might need to be terminated earlier.
16483372:64	Moreover, the mean birth weights increased steadily with advancement of the gestational age.
16483372:65	Twins do continue to grow in utero till 40 weeks.
16483372:66	The presence of higher maternal complications in group I (deliveries before 37 weeks) may, in part, explain the earlier termination of these pregnancies.
16483372:67	Comparing the electively delivered group with the spontaneously delivered group showed that the overall neonatal morbidity was worse in those delivered electively.
16483372:68	This is in agreement with the findings that electively delivered newborns, even at term, have a higher incidence of severe respiratory distress and other complications [5,18,19].
16483372:69	The same was found for the maternal complications.
16483372:70	Again this may explain the reasons for their elective delivery.
16483372:71	When the elective deliveries were analyzed according to the gestational age at labor, no significant difference was found in the perinatal outcome parameters.
16483372:72	Early and late elective twin deliveries had similar outcomes.
16483372:73	One of the limitations of our study was the design.
16483372:74	A well-designed prospective randomized study involving all twin pregnancies and outcomes, at all the gestational ages will be more informative.
16483372:75	Another limitation is the nature of our hospital.
16483372:76	It is a tertiary referral centre which receives all complicated deliveries.
16483372:77	This could make the sample not totally representative of the general population.
16483372:78	Excluding twins of chronically ill mother is another issue.
16483372:79	These may really experience advanced maturation.
16483372:80	Conclusion 
Twins, when the pregnancy is uncomplicated, continue to grow and mature with advancement of the gestational age.
16483372:81	In the absence of significant maternal complications, it is advisable to deliver twins only at 38 completed weeks' gestation or later to avoid neonatal complications.

18591404:0	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Female study participants were recruited from participants in a cross-sectional study assessing BMD in young women with type 1 diabetes and age-matched community control subjects.
18591404:1	Cases for the cross-sectional study (baseline) were recruited from a regional tertiary hospital pediatric diabetes center and from endocrinology practices in Western New York.
18591404:2	At the time of the initial study, the diabetes center followed over 600 patients aged 2–21 years with type 1 diabetes.
18591404:3	Female patients aged 13–21 years in that clinical center were offered the opportunity to participate in the baseline study ( n = 138).
18591404:4	Recruitment of older women involved contacting former center patients (aged >21 years), patients from regional endocrinology practices, and affected relatives of subjects screened by our diabetes center for the Diabetes Prevention Trial.
18591404:5	The comparison group included young women recruited from the same region as the case subjects; most were classmates or acquaintances of the case subjects or were volunteers who learned of the study through flyers posted at the university and hospital.
18591404:6	The baseline study enrolled 72 case subjects (diabetes duration >2 years) and 91 control subjects aged 13–37 years who were at least 2 years postmenarchal.
18591404:7	All type 1 diabetic case subjects and nondiabetic control subjects who participated in the baseline study were recruited ∼2 years later to assess change in BMD over time.
18591404:8	Contact was maintained with study participants between the baseline and follow-up exam via phone and mail.
18591404:9	Inclusion criteria for the follow-up study were participation in the baseline study, current negative pregnancy test, and signed informed consent.
18591404:10	For individuals younger than 18 years of age, a parent cosigned the informed consent.
18591404:11	Exclusion criteria for both the baseline and follow-up study included systemic illness affecting BMD (other than diabetes), other endocrine disorders (except autoimmune thyroiditis), and diagnosis of juvenile osteoporosis or other bone disease.
18591404:12	Individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis on levothyroxine therapy were biochemically euthyroid.
18591404:13	The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo and the University at Buffalo.
18591404:14	At baseline, study participants completed questionnaires relating to personal and family health, lifestyle habits, dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire), and medication intake including use of calcium supplements.
18591404:15	Participants also reported prior fracture history, menstrual history, and demographic information.
18591404:16	For participants with type 1 diabetes, information on disease duration, insulin dose schedule (injections versus continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion), and diabetes complications were reported.
18591404:17	Weight, height, and blood pressure were measured using standard protocols.
18591404:18	BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
18591404:19	DEXA (Hologic QDR-4500A; Hologic, Waltham, MA) was used to measure BMD in the anterior/posterior (L1–4) spine, total hip, femoral neck, total forearm, and whole body.
18591404:20	All scans were performed on the same device for both visits.
18591404:21	A single technician performed all baseline scans and 65% of the follow-up scans; two additional technicians performed the remainder of the follow-up scans (27% and 7%, respectively).
18591404:22	Coefficients of variation (CVs) were determined for measures of all sites for all technicians throughout the study and were all <1% throughout the study.
18591404:23	A daily manufacturer quality control phantom was done to ensure no drift.
18591404:24	There were no software upgrades during the follow-up interval.
18591404:25	The following biomarkers were measured in nontimed blood samples: serum osteocalcin, IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 (by radioimmunoassay), and A1C (by high-performance liquid chromatography with Bio-Rad variant; Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).
18591404:26	Random urinary N-teleopeptide levels were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay.
18591404:27	Blood samples were processed using standard protocols.
18591404:28	Serum for hormonal assays was frozen at −80°C and stored until sent for analysis in batches to Esoterix Laboratory (Calabasas Hills, CA).
18591404:29	A1C (fresh plasma) was assayed in a sequential fashion at the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo laboratory (Kaleida Health).
18591404:30	Urine samples were stored frozen at −80°C.
18591404:31	For hormone measurements, intra-assay CV was <3% for N-telopeptide, 6% for IGF-1 and osteocalcin, and 13% for IGFBP-3.
18591404:32	Interassay CV was <7% for N-Telopeptide, <9.7% for IGF-1, 13% for osteocalcin, and <17% for IGFBP-3 (Esoterix Laboratories).
18591404:33	Data from study participants were analyzed in stratum based on age at initial enrollment.
18591404:34	Demographic, lifestyle, metabolic characteristics, and BMD were compared between diabetic case subjects and nondiabetic control subjects, stratified by age.
18591404:35	Comparisons were made for baseline differences, differences at follow-up, and percent change between the two time points.
18591404:36	Results were presented as both unadjusted comparisons and comparisons of adjusted means (adjusted for age, BMI, and oral contraceptive [OC] use).
18591404:37	Unadjusted differences for continuous variables were examined using Student's t test and for categorical variables using the χ 2 test.
18591404:38	ANOVA was used for adjusted models.
18591404:39	In case subjects only, A1C levels were compared across younger and older age-groups.
18591404:40	Data analyses were performed using SAS version 8 (SAS, Cary, NC).
18591404:41	Post hoc power analysis of follow-up total hip BMD (adjusted for age, BMI, and OC use) indicated that our dataset of 63 case subjects ( n = 37, <20 years of age) and 85 control subjects ( n = 36, <20 years of age) gave our study 80% power to detect a difference between case and control subjects with an α of 0.05 and a target effect size of 0.45 in women <20 years of age and 0.63 in those >20 years of age.
18591404:42	RESULTS 
 includes baseline and follow-up characteristics of women who participated in this follow-up study.
18591404:43	For comparative purposes, study subjects were grouped by age at baseline (<20 years/≥20 years).
18591404:44	The follow-up group included 63 women with type 1 diabetes (58.7% <20 years of age) and 85 control subjects without diabetes (42.4% <20 years of age) at ages 15–39 years at enrollment.
18591404:45	The average follow-up time was 2.14 years.
18591404:46	Of the participants in the baseline study with diabetes, 87.5% (63 of 72) participated in this follow-up study, and 93.4% (85 of 91) of control subjects participated in both examinations.
18591404:47	More subjects from the baseline cohort ≥20 years of age were lost to follow-up (13.8 vs. 3.94%, cohort <20 years of age), with the highest attrition being from individuals with diabetes ≥20 years of age (21.2%).
18591404:48	The primary reason for loss to follow-up was geographic relocation.
18591404:49	Participants in this follow-up study were predominantly non-Hispanic Caucasian (95%) and were similar in age at menarche and years since menarche.
18591404:50	Participants ≥20 years of age with diabetes used OC therapy longer than control subjects ( P ≤ 0.05).
18591404:51	Although few participants were smokers, more women with diabetes reported current smoking; there were no smokers among the control subjects <20 years of age.
18591404:52	At follow-up, women with diabetes, particularly the older women, continued to have higher BMI than control subjects.
18591404:53	Weight change (in percent) was not significantly different over the follow-up period.
18591404:54	As reported previously, more patients in the older cohort were using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( P < 0.01, data not shown).
18591404:55	While a trend toward lower daily insulin requirement was present in the older cohort (0.86 ± 0.42 vs. 0.75 ± 0.22 units · kg −1 · day −1), that difference was not statistically significant.
18591404:56	Subjects ≥20 years of age were more likely to have diabetes-related complications, although no statistical differences were found.
18591404:57	More younger subjects were on levothyroxine therapy.
18591404:58	presents BMD values at baseline and follow-up for each body site measured.
18591404:59	Unadjusted means and means adjusted for age, BMI, and OC use are shown stratified by age-group and diabetes diagnosis.
18591404:60	In those <20 years of age, both case and control subjects had an increase in BMD over the 2-year interval.
18591404:61	The percent increase in BMD from baseline to follow-up was not statistically different between younger subjects and control subjects.
18591404:62	For all participants in the population ≥20 years of age, the BMD from baseline to follow-up remained stable.
18591404:63	Significant differences in BMD were identified at the total hip, femoral neck, and whole body in the case subjects ≥20 years of age compared with the control subjects.
18591404:64	As in the previous report, no differences in BMD were seen between groups in the younger cohort.
18591404:65	In the adjusted model (for age, BMI, and OC use), BMD values at the total hip (baseline, P = 0.003; follow-up, P = 0.007) and femoral neck (baseline and follow-up, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in older women with diabetes compared with control subjects.
18591404:66	After adjustment, the whole-body BMD was no longer significantly different between case and control subjects; however, both age-groups showed a trend toward lower whole-body BMD in the case subjects.
18591404:67	Further adjustment for dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D as well as physical activity did not alter the BMD results (data not shown).
18591404:68	When the analysis was restricted to nonsmokers, the adjusted means changed very little.
18591404:69	For the older cohort, however, the P values were attenuated for the total hip ( P = 0.017) and whole body ( P = 0.215).
18591404:70	In nonsmokers >20 years of age, the percent change difference at the total hip became more pronounced between case and control subjects and reached statistical significance ( P = 0.008).
18591404:71	Overall, IGF-1 levels were lower for all groups compared with baseline.
18591404:72	This is consistent with a physiologic decrease in IGF-1 in postteenage years (Esoterix normative data ).
18591404:73	At the 2-year follow-up, however, the IGF-1 level was significantly lower in the younger diabetic subjects than in the control subjects, although still within the normal range.
18591404:74	IGF-1 levels were not statistically different between diabetic participants and control subjects in the older cohort.
18591404:75	Within the older age-group, IGFBP-3 levels were lower in participants with diabetes than in control subjects ( P < 0.05).
18591404:76	IGFBP-3 levels were comparable for control and diabetic subjects in the cohort <20 years of age.
18591404:77	Serum osteocalcin levels were lower at follow-up for all groups, even with increased bone mineral accrual in the group <20 years of age.
18591404:78	There was no difference in osteocalcin or N-teleopeptide levels between case and control subjects <20 years of age.
18591404:79	After adjusting for age and BMI, case subjects had significantly lower osteocalcin levels than control subjects in the population ≥20 years of age ( P < 0.04; ).
18591404:80	In addition, the percent change in osteocalcin level from baseline to follow-up was significantly different in diabetic women ≥20 years of age compared with control subjects after adjustment ( P < 0.03).
18591404:81	Markers of bone formation did not correlate with BMD in our subjects.
18591404:82	Metabolic control, as measured by A1C, was poorer in the younger diabetic cohort, as we reported previously.
18591404:83	Overall metabolic control was stable within a given age stratum between the baseline and follow-up studies.
18591404:84	No correlation was found between A1C and any of the BMD measurements (data not presented).
18591404:85	When evaluating for associations between metabolic control and BMD measurements that were statistically lower in case than in control subjects at follow-up, the Pearson correlation coefficient ( R value) for A1C and BMD was between 0.121 (total hip) and 0.334 (femoral neck) ( P > 0.095, data not shown).
18591404:86	As in our previous study, there was no association found between BMD and diabetes duration, baseline A1C, or years since menarche.
18591404:87	CONCLUSIONS 
While longitudinal studies have examined the effect of insulin therapy on BMD in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes, few have reported on the natural history of metabolic bone disease in younger women.
18591404:88	Here we present BMD data for a well-characterized cohort of young women with type 1 diabetes at baseline and 2 years later.
18591404:89	The baseline study demonstrated that the older cohort had significantly lower BMD at the femoral neck and lateral spine than age-matched control subjects.
18591404:90	The data presented here demonstrate that case subjects in the older cohort had persistently lower BMD than age-matched healthy control subjects.
18591404:91	In this cohort, BMD at the total hip and femoral neck remained lower than in control subjects after adjusting for age, BMI, and OC use, even with no significant decrease in BMD from baseline to follow-up.
18591404:92	Similar to our initial study, there was no difference in BMD between women with diabetes aged <20 years and control subjects at any of the sites measured.
18591404:93	However, there was a trend toward lower BMD at the total hip and whole body in women with diabetes.
18591404:94	This difference occurred in the face of BMD increases (percent change) at both the total hip and whole body in this population, suggesting that bone mineral accrual is altered in a subtle manner during late adolescence in women with type 1 diabetes.
18591404:95	Individuals with type 2 diabetes have higher than average BMD compared with control subjects, in part due to the mechanical load of obesity.
18591404:96	In our study, women with type 1 diabetes had higher BMI than control subjects.
18591404:97	However, BMD continued to be lower in older women with type 1 diabetes, even after adjusting for BMI; thus, overweight status does not confer protection against poor bone mineralization in these young women.
18591404:98	Although the younger cohort had poorer diabetes control than the older cohort, we were again unable to demonstrate an association between BMD measures and metabolic control, as measured by A1C.
18591404:99	Others have reported similar findings with respect to BMD in children and adolescents with diabetes.
18591404:100	A1C measures short-term diabetes control; perhaps cumulative life-time glycemic control is a better indicator of osteoporotic risk.
18591404:101	This hypothesis is supported by studies demonstrating that decreased lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in adults with type 1 diabetes is associated with retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy, all of which are long-term complications of poor metabolic control ( – ).
18591404:102	In addition, our data did not find a correlation between diabetes duration and BMD, further supporting a possible relation to lifetime diabetes control.
18591404:103	The adverse effects of chronic hyperglycemia related to osteoblast function, osteoclast activity, and formation of advanced glycosylated end products that may impact bone quality as well as bone quantity are difficult to measure in a systematic fashion.
18591404:104	The role of insulin as a direct anabolic agent in bone metabolism is unclear.
18591404:105	Animal models of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced diabetes demonstrate that as insulinopenia develops, there is a suppression of osteoblast markers.
18591404:106	It has been postulated that in addition to insulinopenia, relative IGF-1 deficiency, whether systemic or local, contributes to low BMD in diabetes.
18591404:107	IGF-1 levels are lower in individuals with type 1 diabetes, and poor glycemic control negatively impacts IGF-1 production by the liver.
18591404:108	In adults with type 1 diabetes, IGF-1 levels were lower in individuals with osteopenia at the femoral neck.
18591404:109	Additionally, in a study of 127 children (aged 6–20 years) with diabetes, low bone mineral content correlated with low IGF-1 levels.
18591404:110	In our study, IGF-1 levels of case subjects were significantly lower than those of control subjects only for the younger cohort.
18591404:111	However, IGF-1 levels of subjects with diabetes were lower in the group ≥20 years of age compared with the group <20 years of age, and IGFBP-3 levels in the older cohort were significantly lower compared with control subjects.
18591404:112	Given that no biochemical markers of bone metabolism correlated with BMD at the hip or femoral neck in our study, it could be hypothesized that a cumulative history of insulinopenia and low IGF-1 levels are better correlates for low bone density.
18591404:113	These proposed mechanisms require further exploration.
18591404:114	Our data demonstrate significant differences in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip that are likely to be clinically significant and may explain why women with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of hip fractures later in life.
18591404:115	Our data also indicate that alterations in bone mineral accrual occur within years of achievement of peak bone mass and that there is not a later period of “catch-up” bone mineralization.
18591404:116	The most clinically relevant factor is whether a decrease in BMD correlates with fracture risk, which cannot be determined in this study.
18591404:117	Besides BMD, multiple factors impact fracture risk including, but not limited to, age, nutrition status, smoking history, degree of frailty, and fracture history.
18591404:118	The well-characterized population, the large percentage of women who participated in the follow-up study, and the standard procedures used in this longitudinal study all represent significant strengths.
18591404:119	Yet, we acknowledge certain limitations.
18591404:120	The study population is small, limiting its ability to detect true differences that may still exist.
18591404:121	Study control subjects were community based and may not represent the general population of women.
18591404:122	Finally, the results presented should be interpreted keeping in mind that multiple comparisons were made.
18591404:123	We are aware of the lack of unanimity of opinion regarding the statistical approach when adjusting the statistical testing for many comparisons.
18591404:124	Because many of our hypotheses are nested, and not independent, we feel that using a Bonferroni approach is overly conservative.
18591404:125	However, we have interpreted our results with caution and believe they are stronger when considered as a whole rather than as independent statistical tests.
18591404:126	Our findings demonstrate lower BMD in young women with type 1 diabetes compared with control subjects.
18591404:127	The differences are seen at early ages and may impact future fracture risk.
18591404:128	Although bone density testing is not routinely performed in young women, these data suggest that screening may be important in young women with type 1 diabetes.
18591404:129	In addition, these women should be counseled regarding lifestyle interventions that may improve bone health, including adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, and exercise.
18617575:0	INTRODUCTION 
Recent studies have demonstrated that the Pax gene family controls gene expression activity at the transcription level and regulates fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell death events (apoptosis).
18617575:1	Given their essential role in cell biology, deregulated Pax genes also act as oncogenes and have the potential to transform normal cells into their cancerous counterparts.
18617575:2	A well-studied member of this family, Pax-5 is known to encode the B-cell specific activator protein (BSAP) which is expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, B lymphocytes, and adult testis.
18617575:3	In the past decade, the interest in the Pax-5 transcription factor has been drawn to its pivotal role in B-cell lymphogenesis.
18617575:4	Pax-5 requirement to B commitment is highlighted by its transcriptional control over key events that are essential for B-cell development and activation.
18617575:5	Studies have identified a number of Pax-5 target genes several of which are known to modulate the expression of B-cell receptor (BCR) components and associated proteins (i.e.
18617575:6	CD19 blk etc.).
18617575:7	Pax-5 selective pressure to B-cell commitment is also conveyed by its ability to negatively regulate non-conforming pathways of the B lineage leading to the differentiation of non-B cellular development.
18617575:8	At the genetic level, human Pax-5 is mapped to chromosome 9 in region p13 where it is regulated by two distinct promoters regions: first a TATA-containing upstream promoter associated with an exon 1A, and a TATA-less downstream promoter coupled with an exon 1B.
18617575:9	Through regulated signaling processes along with the recruitment of specific transcriptional regulators, each promoter induces the transcription of a distinct 5′UTR region and a first exon which then splices to a coding sequence (exons 2–10) common to both transcript isoforms.
18617575:10	These two mRNAs (noted Pax-5A and Pax-5B ) are discriminated only by their unique 5′UTR sequence and exon 1 of the coding region ( A).
18617575:11	Although a great number of studies have contributed to the functional characterization of Pax-5 at the molecular and cellular level, few have discriminated between the physiological roles of Pax-5A and Pax-5B isoforms individually.
18617575:12	Given the fact that most Pax-5 bearing cells express both Pax-5 isoforms simultaneously (almost a 1 : 1 ratio in human pre-B cells), the functional study of these alternatively spliced products has proven to be complex and very challenging.
18617575:13	As a result, little attention has been paid to the cellular characterization of Pax-5B . Therefore, we set out to develop a Pax-5B gene suppression system using a modified ribozyme (Rz) technology to investigate the specific roles associated with Pax-5B in human B lymphocytes.
18617575:14	The ability of a ribozyme to specifically recognize, and subsequently catalyze the cleavage of an RNA target makes it an attractive molecular tool for the development of gene inactivation systems.
18617575:15	It provides an interesting alternative to an RNA-interference (RNAi) approach in functional genomics, especially given the recent findings that RNAi specificity is limited and evidence shows that this mechanism can trigger immunological response.
18617575:16	The ribozyme isolated from the hepatitis delta virus (HDV Rz) appears to be the most suited to develop a gene-inactivation in human cells since it has evolved within this particular cell environment.
18617575:17	In support of this, results have shown this catalytic RNA to be fully active in physiological concentrations of magnesium in human cells.
18617575:18	However, the target recognition mechanism of the HDV Rz is dependant on the formation of a 7 base pair (bp) between the Rz and the substrate, (namely the P1 stem/ B).
18617575:19	It has been estimated that a minimum sequence of 15 or 16 base pairing nucleotides are required for the targeting of unique RNA species in the human transcriptome, thereby limiting non-specific cleavage.
18617575:20	In order to fulfill these parameters, a new generation of HDV Rz was engineered which incorporates a Specific On/ofF Adaptor (SOFA) that switches the cleavage activity from off to on solely in the presence of the appropriate substrate ( B).
18617575:21	A unique feature of the SOFA-HDV Rz allows it to limit the catalytic activity via a blocking sequence that prevents the folding of the ribozyme into an active conformation.
18617575:22	This ‘safety lock’ function prevents cleavage of a substrate that contains an appropriate P1 stem but lacks a complementary sequence to the SOFA biosensor.
18617575:23	This new target-dependent module biosensor bearing Rz significantly reduces non-specific cleavage events.
18617575:24	In this study, we developed an isoform-specific SOFA-HDV Rz capable of recognizing and cleaving human Pax-5B transcripts both in vitro and in vivo .
18617575:25	Using this gene suppression system, we report that the Pax-5B transcriptional element is associated with changes in target gene activation as well as to the balance of cell fate events in human B lymphocytes.
18617575:26	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
In order to investigate the functional role of the human Pax-5B transcription factor, we have developed a RNA-based gene suppression system which has the ability to specifically recognize, bind and cleave an RNA substrate in a sequence-specific manner.
18617575:27	The specific SOFA-HDV Rz were designed to target sequences within the exon 1B that includes non-translated and coding sequence of the human Pax - 5 gene.
18617575:28	Target sequences were identified considering the substrate preference of the SOFA-HDV Rz (i.e. a guanosine residue in position +1 of the cleavage site, no guanosine in position –1, and no two consecutive pyrimidines in positions –1 and –2.
18617575:29	Moreover, in order to ensure the substrate specificity of the SOFA-HDV Rz, the sequences targeted were analyzed using RiboSubstrates, an integrated bioinformatics software that enables a search of a cDNA database for all potential substrates for a given ribozyme.
18617575:30	This includes the mRNAs that perfectly match the specific requirements of a given SOFA-HDV Rz, as well those including wobble and mismatches base pairings.
18617575:31	These analyses revealed that the designed SOFA-HDV Rz should solely cleave the Pax - 5B mRNAs from the human transcriptome (data not shown).
18617575:32	DISCUSSION 
Many recent studies have contributed to the better understanding of general Pax-5 function in various biological processes; however, few have attempted to discriminate between the physiological roles of the individual Pax-5A and Pax-5B variants.
18617575:33	The inherent difficulty is largely due to the fact that both genes and proteins are nearly identical differing only by their first exon.
18617575:34	Most studies that examined the role of Pax-5 have relied mainly on antibodies, nucleic probes, RNAi, antisense oligonucleotides and/or site-directed genetic alteration that target common regions present in both Pax-5A and Pax-5B .
18617575:35	It is, therefore, not possible to draw conclusions on the specific roles of the individual genes and/or proteins from these previous works.
18617575:36	Recently, the development of gene inactivation tools has focused on the attenuation or silencing of target mRNA for the study of gene function.
18617575:37	Reliable and selective gene suppression systems are a valuable tool to create loss and gain of function models which provide new insights for intracellular signaling discovery and pathway analysis.
18617575:38	In this context, the findings of this study are significant.
18617575:39	Here, we validate a novel gene-suppression system based on a genetically modified viral ribozyme for the functional characterization of highly similar gene products transcribed from the Pax-5 gene locus.
18617575:40	This new gene-silencing approach has allowed us to reveal the important contribution of the Pax-5B gene during apoptotic events in human B lymphocytes.
18617575:41	We have recently modified the native HDV Rz by the addition of a biosensor for the recognition of its specific substrate.
18617575:42	The SOFA-HDV Rz is the only RNA-based gene suppression system of its kind to function as a riboswitch and therefore cleave only when the specific target mRNA is present.
18617575:43	It has been shown previously that most Pax-5 expressing cells simultaneously produce multiple Pax-5 isoforms ( , ).
18617575:44	Therefore, to study the unique contributions of the different gene products, we developed several SOFA-HDV Rz designed to target unique regions found in the human Pax-5B exon 1 mRNA sequence.
18617575:45	When tested in vitro and in vivo these Pax-5B specific SOFA-HDV Rz displayed a high level of target specificity.
18617575:46	In all assays, we observed specific recognition and cleavage of the Pax-5B substrate with no suppressive off-target effects on the levels of the other major isoform Pax-5A . More interestingly, in B lymphocytes co-expressing Pax-5 isoforms, Pax-5A mRNA expression levels were up-regulated following Pax-5B down-regulation.
18617575:47	These results suggest that Pax-5B plays a negative role in the transactivity of other Pax-5 isoforms.
18617575:48	These observations are not surprising given the fact that autoregulation and negative transregulation activities between Pax-5 variants have been previously reported.
18617575:49	As a control, we also designed a functional yet non-specific SOFA-HDV Rz and when tested in similar conditions, our results show that this ribozyme does not affect levels of Pax-5B RNA.
18617575:50	Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the SOFA-HDV Rz was not cell-type dependent since Pax-5B transcript cleavage was observed in both HEK 293 and REH cells lines.
18617575:51	It is important to note that substrate cleavage occurs via direct ribozyme activity and is not mediated by RNA interference since the longest complementary region between a SOFA-HDV Rz and its Pax-5B substrate is 12 bp.
18617575:52	We further ruled out the involvment of RNAi pathway components by gene expression analysis of mRNA from SOFA-HDV Rz transfected cells which revealed no activity from any RNAi elements following SOFA-HDV Rz mediated cleavage of a specific substrate (unpublished data; F. Brière, M. Laflamme, J.P.
18617575:53	Perreault and R. Ouellette).
18617575:54	The dose-dependent catalytic activity of the SOFA-HDV Rz observed in our transient co-transfections was not as pronounced when studying transfected B lymphocytes.
18617575:55	In certain cases using B lymphocytes, the highest level of gene expression knock-down was observed in transfected clones with lower cellular concentration of ribozyme expression.
18617575:56	These observations may be due to substrate accessibility and competition between promoter elements in our co-transfection settings.
18617575:57	The reduction of Pax-5B transcript levels had a subsequent effect on Pax-5B protein levels which was most likely due to decreases in synthesis levels.
18617575:58	Our findings using EMSA assays revealed that ribozyme-mediated gene silencing led to a concomitant attenuation of the target protein expression as observed by a decrease in Pax-5B DNA-binding activity.
18617575:59	This reduced binding was not associated with a general decrease in DNA-binding activity as revealed by NF-κB control experiments.
18617575:60	Our findings suggest that high levels of Pax-5B suppression are incompatible with survival of B cells (REH).
18617575:61	Following selection of stably-transfected REH clones, the maximum level ribozyme-mediated suppression of Pax-5B was 85% of control cells.
18617575:62	( A).
18617575:63	Despite numerous attempts, we were unable to identify any stably-transfected SOFA-HDV Rz clones with a greater reduction of Pax-5B expression.
18617575:64	These findings are consistent with our results of Pax-5B knock-down experiments using RNAi (unpublished data; Robichaud, G.A. and R. Ouellette).
18617575:65	In these experiments, we found that with Pax-5B -directed RNAi sequences we were able to completely suppress Pax-5B expression.
18617575:66	However, total suppression of Pax-5B led to complete cell death of REH cells compared to control REH cells that received a scrambled RNAi sequence.
18617575:67	Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a minimal requirement of Pax-5B expression is required for cell survival.
18617575:68	It also reveals the usefulness of the SOFA-HDV Rz system as a tool to selectively suppress and study vital cellular elements.
18617575:69	We then used our Pax-5B -attenuated B-cell system to study the effects on a known downstream target of Pax-5A in this case, the CD19 gene.
18617575:70	In previous studies, the DNA-binding motif of the Pax-5A protein or BSAP has been shown to bind the CD19 promoter region via a cluster of proximal Pax-5 recognition sites.
18617575:71	Subsequently, this protein–DNA interaction induces CD19 gene expression which acts as a developmental checkpoint for early B-lineage commitment.
18617575:72	Surprisingly, we observed a marked increase in CD19 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels in our Pax-5B knockdown B cells which, taken together, imply that Pax-5B is a negative regulator of CD19 . This finding is contrary to the positive regulatory effect of Pax-5A on CD19 observed in previous studies.
18617575:73	Interestingly, CD19 is a key molecule in the B lymphocyte signal transduction complex, where it associates with other proteins including the B-cell antigen complex (BCR) which has been shown to regulate B-cell fate and function.
18617575:74	The CD19 surface protein modulates basal signaling thresholds and accelerates BCR signals thus serving as a general ‘rheostat’ that defines downstream signaling critical for B-cell responses, growth and autoimmunity.
18617575:75	Furthermore, in certain instances, CD19 has also been shown to attenuate B-cell activation and proliferation events.
18617575:76	It is precisely these CD19 events that could explain the lower proliferation rates observed in Pax-5B attenuated B lymphocytes.
18617575:77	Previous studies have also demonstrated that a decrease in the expression of the human Pax-5 gene (with no discrimination to Pax-5A or Pax-5B ) is associated with decreased B-cell growth rates.
18617575:78	In addition to the lower proliferation rates seen in Pax-5B knockdown cells, we observed that these B lymphocytes undergo apoptotic events that are mediated through the activity of CASPASES 3\7.
18617575:79	Apoptosis is a key cellular pathway that mitigates the production of defective cells that occur during aberrant cellular processes such as hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, infection, mutation, anergy and oncogenesis.
18617575:80	Apoptosis is particularly important during the development of lymphocytes when it removes both ineffective and potentially harmful cells via the withdrawal of survival signals.
18617575:81	Interestingly, Pax-5 expression has been primarily associated with the development and maintenance of B-cell progenitors, then subsequently decreases and ceases in terminally differentiated plasma cells.
18617575:82	Our findings suggest that Pax-5B may be closely involved in the differentiation checkpoints that ensure the precise regulation of the development and proliferation programs.
18617575:83	This is consistent with data from Rahman et al., which show that the suppression of Pax-5 results in the growth arrest of pre-B cells—results that were not observed in either pro-B or mature B-cell lines.
18617575:84	Apoptosis also plays a role in the prevention of oncogenic transformation associated with the development of cancer.
18617575:85	Numerous studies have shown that aberrant expression of Pax-5 has been associated with the onset of different types of cancers, whereas others have also shown that Pax-5 is overexpressed in many types of B cell lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia.
18617575:86	Therefore, it appears that Pax-5 gene products are responsible on the one hand for the promotion B-cell commitment, and on the other, for the homeostasis of cell fate events.
18617575:87	As a key switch in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis, Pax-5B could represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
18617575:88	Further analysis of other downstream cell-fate regulators and known Pax-5 pathway components [i.e. p53, Ets-1, PD-1 etc.] will help elucidate the complex networks and cell-fate events involved in B-cell development and oncogenesis.
18617575:89	We are presently addressing some of these issues.
18617575:90	More recently, we and others have newly identified and characterized Pax-5 isoforms which result from the alternative splicing of the Pax-5 coding regions.
18617575:91	On a functional basis, these protein variants possess different transactivation potential and have the ability to interact with different protein partners, and in certain cases, specific Pax-5 isoforms have been correlated with different types of cancers.
18617575:92	These findings begin to address the complexity of the Pax-5 transcript and protein isoform function in B lymphocytes.
18617575:93	Through the use of isoform-specific gene-silencing tools such as SOFA-HDV Rz, we are now able to better interrogate these regulators involved in B-cell development, cell-fate events and oncogenesis.
19664219:0	Background 
For hundreds of years, the written prescription has been the method of choice for physicians to communicate decisions on drug therapy, and for pharmacists to dispense medications, while at the same time being a source for the patient about how to use the medication in order to maximize its benefit.
19664219:1	Currently, the medical prescription is at the transitional stage between paper and the electronic state.
19664219:2	When adapting a traditional process to the new electronic era, unique opportunities and challenges are offered the involved actors: patients, prescribers, pharmacists, and also health care and EHR-system providers and other stakeholders . 
New technologies may introduce new risks with the extended use of the prescription information in large-scale databases . A mistake by a prescriber may result in the incorrect medication being dispensed at the pharmacy, and also in the wrong documentation being recorded for future consultations.
19664219:3	A mistake by a system programmer may also result in the incorrect medication being dispensed, but for a large group of patients.
19664219:4	Future clinical decisions may also be based on wrong facts and assumptions, due to poor quality of the data provided.
19664219:5	Thus, quality issues are even more accentuated in the electronic world . 
The penetration rate of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in Sweden is extensive, 86% of the employees in health care used EHR-systems in 2007 .
19664219:6	However, many different EHR-systems are employed, with varying ePrescription designs and functionalities.
19664219:7	Even within a health care region or a single hospital, different EHR-systems are employed.
19664219:8	Regardless of the EHR-system used, the prescriber must be confident with its functionality, effectiveness and safety.
19664219:9	The Swedish experience of ePrescribing began in 1983 with the world's first Electronically Transferred Prescription (ETP) for outpatients, between the computer systems in a doctor's office and a nearby outpatient pharmacy . The first pilot project was followed by several others during the 1980's.
19664219:10	After a new national strategy was decided at the end of the 1990's, the number of ePrescriptions in Sweden has escalated (Figure ), with a penetration rate for ePrescriptions of about 70% of all new prescriptions in September 2008 . More formal requirements (National ePrescription format, NEF) on the electronic communication process with automated quality checks are currently being implemented nationwide.
19664219:11	Figure illustrates how ePrescriptions are transmitted, stored and dispensed in Sweden.
19664219:12	An online prescription repository allows patients to store their prescriptions electronically for refills, and to have access to valid prescriptions (iterations included) at any pharmacy with the presentation of valid identification, making paper prescriptions obsolete.
19664219:13	Patients may also have access to their stored prescriptions on the Internet by means of a secure digital authentication, enabling new services like mail-order delivery of prescription drugs.
19664219:14	The aim of the present study was to evaluate experienced ePrescribers' attitudes towards ePrescribing for suggesting improvements.
19664219:15	Methods 
Results 
A majority of the respondents regarded their EHR-system easy to use in general (81%; 146/180) and for the prescribing of drugs (88%; 158/180) (Table ).
19664219:16	Most respondents believed they were able to provide the patients better service by ePrescribing (92%; 166/180), and regarded ePrescriptions to be time saving (91%; 164/180).
19664219:17	Eighty-three percent (149/180) stated that ePrescriptions were safer than handwritten prescriptions.
19664219:18	The different packages and the price were regarded clearly displayed by 78% (141/180) and 51% (91/180), respectively.
19664219:19	We found a difference in attitudes between physicians that were rare (< 5 ePrescriptions/day), intermediate (5–10 ePrescriptions/day) and extensive (> 10 ePrescriptions/day) users of ePrescribing.
19664219:20	The intermediate and extensive users, to a greater extent than the rare users, regarded their EHR-system easy to use (p = 0.0003), easy to prescribe drugs with (p = 0.0001) and to be time saving (p ≤ 0.0001).
19664219:21	The intermediate and extensive users, to a greater extent than the rare users, also regarded the patient's security number (p = 0.01) and name (p = 0.04), together with the price of the drug (p = 0.0002), to be clearly displayed.
19664219:22	To the statements concerning safety and better service to the patients, extensive users agreed to a higher degree than intermediate and rare users (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0005, respectively).
19664219:23	We found no differences in attitudes towards how the EHR-systems display different packages.
19664219:24	Respondents who had been using their EHR-system for ePrescribing more than one year, were more likely than respondents who had been using ePrescribing for less than a year, to regard their EHR-system easy to use (p = 0.004) and easy to prescribe drugs with (p = 0.004).
19664219:25	They also, to a greater extent, regarded the patient's personal security number (p = 0.003) and name (p = 0.01) to be clearly displayed in their EHR-system when ePrescribing.
19664219:26	However, there was no evidence that respondents who had been ePrescribing through their EHR-system for more than one year were more likely to regard ePrescriptions as time saving, safer or to perceive that they provided better service to patients.
19664219:27	Also, we could not show any differences in attitudes concerning how the price and packages were displayed.
19664219:28	The respondents' opinions on strengths and weaknesses are presented in Table and . The most frequently reported opinion of strengths with ePrescribing was 'fast and easy' (30%); the most frequently expressed weakness was 'complicated drug choice' (21%).
19664219:29	Suggested improvements are reported in Table . 
A minority of the respondents (13%; 23/180) perceived that it was possible to handle more than one patient at a time when ePrescribing.
19664219:30	A majority (73%; 132/180) reported that they were always or often performing a final check of the ePrescription before transmitting; 25% (45/180) declared that they were seldom or never performing a final check.
19664219:31	The routines of cancelling prescriptions and of handling the situation when the ePrescription transfer is disrupted showed great variability (Figure and ).
19664219:32	This variability could also be observed within the different EHR-systems.
19664219:33	The answers to the question 'After sending an ePrescription to the pharmacy, do you get a receipt from the pharmacy that the ePrescription is received?'
19664219:34	differed; 62% (111/180) reported they did not get a receipt, 26% (47/180) reported they got a receipt, and 12% (21/180) did not know.
19664219:35	Discussion 
The group of Swedish physicians studied was generally satisfied with their specific EHR-system and with ePrescribing as such.
19664219:36	However, we identified some problems that may affect the ePrescribing process, e.g. one quarter of the physicians seldom or never performed a final check of the ePrescription before transmission, the drug choice was perceived to be complicated, and there were different routines among physicians when cancelling ePrescriptions or in case of disrupted ePrescription transmission.
19664219:37	Also, more than half of the respondents reported a lack of receipt from the pharmacy after successful transmission of the ePrescription.
19664219:38	These weaknesses in the ePrescribing process warrant improvements of the provided EHR-systems per se, as well as of their implementation in the individual health care organisation, and the associated training for users.
19664219:39	The present study was not designed to quantify differences or to rank the six different EHR-systems.
19664219:40	Rather, it was useful to identify general attitudes among users, and also to reveal strengths and weaknesses in the ePrescribing processes.
19664219:41	We regard our study to reflect the situation for the Swedish physicians in 2007 in the selected health care regions but not to be representative for all physicians, since the population included was selected and thus not a random sample.
19664219:42	However, physicians from 7 out of 21 health care regions and 4 different disciplines were included.
19664219:43	Furthermore, the six EHR-systems included in the study dominate the Swedish market.
19664219:44	We cannot exclude that attitudes and behaviour differ from other health care regions depending on the EHR-system used, the organisation, and how the prescribers are trained and supported.
19664219:45	The results should be regarded as hypothesis generating, depending on the non-random method of recruitment.
19664219:46	Our selections of regions and clinical heads as well as the clinical heads' ways to provide us with e-mail addresses represent potential risks for selection biases.
19664219:47	A random sample of physicians and a higher response rate would have improved the validity of the study.
19664219:48	In contrast to many other countries, Sweden has a single-payer health care system which might result in a less complex ePrescribing process.
19664219:49	Consequently, the generalisability of the results to other nations might be limited.
19664219:50	We did not collect data about how long respondents had used handwritten prescriptions, and we cannot exclude that some respondents had never used handwritten prescriptions.
19664219:51	However, given that the ePrescribing systems have been implemented at one clinic at a time, mainly during the last five years, and physicians work at a number of different clinics during their education and further training, we estimate the probability that a substantial proportion of the respondents had never used handwritten prescriptions as small.
19664219:52	A majority of the respondents stated that ePrescriptions are time saving, in agreement with previous studies [ , ].
19664219:53	A study using time-motion techniques to compare prescribing times for paper-based prescribing and ePrescribing reported no differences in prescribing times . In our study, more than 90% of the physicians felt they were able to offer their patients better service by ePrescribing.
19664219:54	An example of the improved service according to the respondents is that patients are able to fill the prescription at any Swedish pharmacy.
19664219:55	The varying answers to the questions about cancelling prescriptions and disrupted ePrescription transmission might be explained by the lack of distinct routines and training.
19664219:56	When cancelling prescriptions, prescribers should always inform the pharmacy and cancel the prescription in the EHR.
19664219:57	How to proceed when the ePrescribing transmission is disrupted depends on which EHR-system the prescriber is using.
19664219:58	In some EHR-systems, the prescription is automatically sent when the transfer is restored, in others this function is missing.
19664219:59	The prescriber needs to be aware of how disrupted ePrescribing transmission is managed in his/her specific EHR-system; otherwise the result could be duplicate prescriptions or no prescription at all.
19664219:60	The finding that 13% of the physicians perceived it possible to handle more than one patient at a time was hard to interpret, as all EHR-vendors state that this is impossible.
19664219:61	For some of the survey items, rare users of ePrescriptions were found to have more negative attitudes and extensive users more positive attitudes towards ePrescribing.
19664219:62	Physicians transmitting more than five ePrescriptions per day were more positive towards ePrescribing than those prescribing less with respect to ease of use, time savings, and how clearly the patient's personal security number and name together with the price of the drug were displayed.
19664219:63	A similar pattern was seen when analysing differences between prescribers who had used their EHR-system for less than a year and prescribers who had used it for more than a year; the more inexperienced users being more negative about ease of use and how the personal security number and name were displayed.
19664219:64	One explanation to the differences in attitudes between these groups might be that physicians have to use the ePrescribing function regularly and extensively in order to fully appreciate it .
19664219:65	The ePrescribing function of the EHR-systems might not be intuitive enough for being fully appreciated also by rare users.
19664219:66	ePrescriptions were considered as safer compared to handwritten prescriptions by the majority of the respondents; an opinion supported by others [ - ].
19664219:67	However, prescribers and pharmacists need to be aware that EHR-systems may introduce new types of errors [ , ].
19664219:68	We revealed important weaknesses, which could be attributed to the user interface, special features in the EHR-systems or lack of distinct routines.
19664219:69	None of the EHR-systems investigated was "perfect" overall.
19664219:70	Some of these shortcomings might imply an increased risk for medication errors.
19664219:71	Based on our findings, we suggest that: 
- The prescriber should get a receipt when the transmission is complete, and know how it is displayed.
19664219:72	- It should be mandatory to check the ePrescription a last time before transmitting it to the pharmacy.
19664219:73	- There have to be distinct routines how to handle situations when the ePrescription transfer is disrupted.
19664219:74	- The EHR-system must clearly and unambiguously display the patient's name and personal security number.
19664219:75	To improve the ePrescribing process, there is a need for extensive guidelines and distinct requirements from the authorities.
19664219:76	There is also a need for good cooperation between EHR-system software providers and health care providers to enable compliance to these guidelines.
19664219:77	We believe that it is necessary to have a more formal certification procedure of EHR-systems and ePrescribing.
19664219:78	Since ePrescription during the last few years has developed to be the regular way to prescribe drugs in Sweden, repeated user studies are warranted aiming at further improvement of quality and security of the ePrescription process.
19664219:79	We also recommend research studies for investigation of new types of prescribing errors, including risk assessment for patients.
19664219:80	Conclusion 
The Swedish physicians in the group studied were generally satisfied with their specific EHR-system and with ePrescribing as such.
19664219:81	However, identified weaknesses warrant improvements of the EHR-systems as well as of their implementation in the individual health care organisation.

21436988:1	Introduction 

				Development of computational tools has been one of the central topics in the computational neuroscience community.
21436988:2	Several simulators of bioelectrical activity are publicly available and considered well-established tools.
21436988:3	Both the cellular mechanisms behind this activity and the communication between cells, through the exchange of activity, can be modeled and analyzed using these tools . In addition to the bioelectrical activity, the morphological structure of neurons and neuronal networks can be reconstructed by methods based on the experimentally verified morphological constraints . Recently, two simulators were proposed, aiming to reproduce the morphological and structural changes of neuronal networks during growth . These two tools reproduce the morphological characteristics of neurons in each step of growth and not only in its final phase.
21436988:4	Both provide a set of components that can be combined in a user-defined model, including functions defining axonal and dendritic growth, morphology of different types of neurons, or environmental constraints.
21436988:5	They can reproduce growth in planar and three-dimensional space.
21436988:6	Currently, they simulate solely the morphological aspects of neuronal circuits, but they will likely be extended, in the near future, to include the development of bioelectrical activity.
21436988:7	Various aspects of growth in neuronal systems can be analyzed using models . Some models concentrate on details of biophysical processes related to one phenomenon, while others describe several processes with less details . Examples of analyzed phenomena are initialization of dendritic and axonal arbors , dynamics of intracellular chemicals involved in axonal and dendritic outgrowth , and selection of axon growth direction following guidance cues in the environment . The framework for phenomenological modeling of growth is proposed in [ , ].
21436988:8	Here, the statistics of morphological changes, including branching and elongation, are computed without a reference to the intracellular or extracellular processes leading to those changes.
21436988:9	Finally, the models of growth of neuronal populations and formation of networks are proposed in . In , the influence of guidance cues on axonal growth and the developed network properties are studied.
21436988:10	In , a study of activity-dependent growth of neuronal networks is presented.
21436988:11	Recently, an activity-dependent model of growth was utilized to examine the self-tuning to criticality . 
In this work, we assess the applicability of NETMORPH and CX3D simulators, proposed in , to study the growth in neocortical cultures.
21436988:12	The neocortical cultures represent an experimental model of moderate size neocortical circuits, consisting of 10,000–100,000 neurons.
21436988:13	The immature neurons are extracted from the neocortex of rat embryos and plated on a dish.
21436988:14	Such neurons, regularly supplied with nutrients, develop their full morphology and functionality.
21436988:15	The proportion of different neuronal subtypes observed in cultures is similar as in the neocortex . The neurons retain similar morphological and functional properties as those found in the neocortex  . Still, the cultures contain only a moderate number of cells which live in a suboptimal environment.
21436988:16	Their organization is substantially different from the one observed in the neocortical tissue, since neurons form planar networks different from the layered three-dimensional columns in the neocortex.
21436988:17	Several aspects make cultures a valuable tool for the study of cortical circuits.
21436988:18	In cultures, the study of relation between morphology and functionality is feasible, since both can be studied simultaneously using the established experimental techniques.
21436988:19	The morphological changes can be followed using a combination of cell staining and microscopy  .
21436988:20	At the same time, their functionality can be assessed using either the patch-clamp recordings from single neurons  or by recording the activity from several locations in the network using the microelectrode arrays (MEA) . The morphological and functional properties of neurons can be manipulated by changing the content of the extracellular space.
21436988:21	Properly maintained cultures can survive for several months , and all of the described methods can be applied at different times during the culture life which provides an experimental framework for study of growth.
21436988:22	The simulated model of neocortical cultures is constructed using the information available in the literature.
21436988:23	We opted for a model based on the statistical description of morphological changes during growth, proposed in , without trying to model intracellular or extracellular biophysical processes.
21436988:24	These models are the intrinsic part of NETMORPH simulator and the implementation of fundamentally different growth rules would require changing the core of the simulator.
21436988:25	The CX3D allows more flexibility in model description, and the adopted growth rules are implemented following [ , ].
21436988:26	The considered model allows the precise reconstruction of single neuron morphology and the constraints it imposes on the connectivity between neurons.
21436988:27	Still, the model employs relatively simple rules and does not depend on many parameters.
21436988:28	Therefore, it is suitable for the analysis of structural changes in neuronal networks during growth.
21436988:29	The implemented model does not consider the role of activity that spontaneously emerges in neuronal cultures, but it mimics the synapse formation.
21436988:30	Potential synapses are formed whenever the presynaptic and the postsynaptic sites are close enough.
21436988:31	A certain percentage of these synapses can be considered “functional”.
21436988:32	According to , the percentage of potential synapses that can be considered functional is 25% in vivo .
21436988:33	This percentage might be significantly different in cultures, due to the absence of columnar organization, smaller number of neurons that form synapses, and smaller density of dendrites and axons.
21436988:34	The experimental studies estimate that in a culture a neuron directly connects to 10–30 of other neurons through functional synapses .

In this section, the adopted model of neuronal growth in neocortical cultures is presented in detail, together with the implementation details in the two simulators.

21436988:46	Results 
This section summarizes the results and conclusions obtained by simulating the described model of growth using the two tools, NETMORPH and CX3D.
21436988:47	A network of 100 neurons was constructed using the parameter set described in and . Some of the parameters were varied, namely, the initial elongation rate ( ν 0) for axons and all types of dendrites.
21436988:48	The proportion between the elongation rates of axons, basal, apical, and nonpyramidal dendrites is fixed and only the overall intensity of growth influencing all of them is varied.
21436988:49	Five different parameter sets were tested for each of the simulators.
21436988:50	The simulations reproduce the growth of neurons from the first day after plating them on a dish until the end of the third week (day 21) on the dish.
21436988:51	The simulation step size was fixed to 0.1 h, a value sufficiently small to ensure stable simulations with both tools.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common multi-component condition including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.
21767357:1	It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes . A central question in understanding the MetS is why these traits cluster together . The clustering may be explained by a complex physiological cascade of events, in which the occurrence of one trait initiates the occurrence of a second.
21767357:2	Alternatively, a causative factor common to several metabolic traits may explain the clustering.
21767357:3	This factor could be either of genetic or environmental nature . 
Family and twin studies indicate that the different features of the MetS share a common genetic component [ - ].
21767357:4	Twin studies show that the correlation between the features of the metabolic syndrome is higher in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins [ , ].
21767357:5	Family studies also show significant genetic correlations between the different features of the metabolic syndrome . Heritability estimates of the MetS itself range from 13-27% [ - ].
21767357:6	However, despite the evidence from these heritability studies, only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to multiple features of the MetS.
21767357:7	Disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism may lead to the development of one or more MetS features . Therefore, genes involved in these pathways are potentially pleiotropic for multiple MetS features.
21767357:8	In a population based cohort study, we studied 373 SNPs mainly selected from transcriptional pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism, and their association with multiple features of the MetS.
21767357:9	Methods 
Results 
Baseline characteristics among the 3575 subjects of the Doetinchem cohort are presented in table . Hypertension was the most prevalent MetS feature (41.6% of the subjects were stable hypertensive and 32.3% of the subjects were stable normotensive).
21767357:10	The least prevalent MetS feature was low HDL-cholesterol (18.7% were stable for low HDL and 64.1% were stable for high HDL).
21767357:11	The most frequent combination of co-occurring MetS features was hypertension and abdominal obesity (14.5% were stable positive, 21.2% were stable negative).
21767357:12	The least frequent combination was decreased HDL-cholesterol levels and hyperglycemia (3.5% were stable positive, 32.6% were stable negative).
21767357:13	19 SNPs were related to at least one of the stable MetS features with P < 0.01 (table ).
21767357:14	Two of them, Ile405Val (rs5882) in the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) gene and Cys112Arg (rs429358) in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene were related to 2 MetS features each with P < 0.01.
21767357:15	This number differs significantly from the expected 0.12 SNPs to be associated with two features or more by chance alone (p < 0.005 chi-square with Yates correction).
21767357:16	Both SNPs were in HWE ( Ile405Val P = 0.21; Cys112Arg P = 0.48).
21767357:17	The minor Val allele of Ile405Val in the CETP gene was associated with both a decreased prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels (PR/allele 0.76, 95%CI 0.69; 0.86) and a decreased prevalence of abdominal obesity (PR/allele 0.90, 95%CI 0.83; 0.97) (table ).
21767357:18	The minor Arg allele of the Cys112Arg in the APOE gene was associated with an increased prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels (PR/allele 1.21, 95% CI 1.07; 1.37) and an increased prevalence of abdominal obesity (PR/allele 1.12, 95% CI 1.03; 1.23) (table ).
21767357:19	Results for both SNPs remained significant after adjusting the abdominal obesity analyses for HDL-cholesterol and vice versa.
21767357:20	Further analyses showed that both SNPs were associated with the simultaneous occurrence of abdominal obesity and low HDL-cholesterol levels, with decreased HDL-cholesterol levels in a subgroup of people without abdominal obesity, and with abdominal obesity in a subgroup of people with normal HDL-cholesterol levels (table ; table ).
21767357:21	The Cys112Arg genotype of the APOE gene is part of the ε2, ε3, ε4 haplotype.
21767357:22	Results of the ε2ε3ε4 haplotype analyses were similar to the results of the Cys112Arg analyses.
21767357:23	Compared to the ε3/ε3 isoform, the ε4/- isoforms (ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4) were associated with an increased prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels (PR 1.24, 95%CI 1.07; 1.44) and an increased prevalence of abdominal obesity (PR 1.13, 95%CI 1.01; 1.26).
21767357:24	No associations were found with the ε2/- isoforms (ε3/ε2 and ε2/ε2).
21767357:25	Discussion 
In this explorative study of 373 SNPs, mainly located in pathways related to lipid and glucose metabolism, we found a significant association between the Ile405Val genotype in the CETP gene and the Cys112Arg genotype in the APOE gene, with multiple features of the metabolic syndrome, i.e. the prevalence of abdominal obesity and prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol.
21767357:26	For both SNPs, the association with abdominal obesity was partly independent of the association with HDL-cholesterol, and vice versa.
21767357:27	No, association was found between SNPs in genes involved in glucose metabolism or blood pressure regulation and multiple MetS features.
21767357:28	In humans, CETP and ApoE are expressed in the liver and in peripheral tissues, such as adipose tissue . Both genes are involved in plasma lipid homeostasis.
21767357:29	CETP stimulates the clearance of HDL-cholesterol from plasma . Furthermore, CETP increases the formation of small dense LDL particles and triglycerides . ApoE removes atherogenic lipoproteins, such as VLDL, from the circulation .
21767357:30	This results in lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
21767357:31	Besides having a role in lipid homeostasis, a few studies indicate that CETP and ApoE may be involved in other metabolic processes such as weight regulation.
21767357:32	For example, APOE plays a role in the deposition of dietary fat in adipose tissue . As CETP is synthesized in the adipose tissue, CETP may affect adipose tissue characteristics . 
The Ile405Val polymorphism in the CETP gene induces a change in amino acid sequence.
21767357:33	Therefore it is likely to be a functional SNP.
21767357:34	In our study, the Val allele of the Ile405Val genotype was associated with a lower prevalence of abdominal obesity and a lower prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels.
21767357:35	The stratified and adjusted analyses in our study suggested that the association with prevalence of abdominal obesity and prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels was partly independent of each other.
21767357:36	This suggests that CETP regulates weight and HDL-cholesterol via independent pathways.
21767357:37	In line with our results, a meta-analysis of 29 studies, showed that Val allele carriers had higher HDL levels . Furthermore, a Chinese case-control study in 934 obesity cases and 924 controls showed a decreased obesity risk for Val/Val homozygotes, which persisted after adjustment for HDL-cholesterol levels . In previous studies, the 405Val allele has been associated with lower CETP mass and lower CETP activity . Lower CETP plasma levels are correlated with a lower obesity risk . The 405Val allele has also been associated with other positive health outcomes such as, increased HDL and LDL particle size , decreased coronary heart disease risk , and increased longevity , all of which are related to the MetS.
21767357:38	In summary, cumulative evidence indicates that Ile405Val is involved in several metabolic processes, including lipid level control and weight regulation.
21767357:39	The Cys112Arg genotype of the APOE gene is a non-synonymous genotype.
21767357:40	Together with Arg158Cys (rs7412) the Cys112Arg forms the ε2ε3ε4 haplotype.
21767357:41	The ε2, ε3 and ε4 ApoE isoforms differ markedly on the structural and functional level . In our study the Arg allele of the Cys112Arg genotype was associated with an increased prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels and an increased prevalence of abdominal obesity.
21767357:42	Again the stratified and adjusted analyses suggested that the associations with the prevalence of abdominal obesity and prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol levels were partly independent of each other.
21767357:43	The ε4 isoform showed a similar, though less pronounced, pattern of associations.
21767357:44	No associations were observed with Arg158Cys or ε2 isoform, of the ε2ε3ε4 haplotype.
21767357:45	Previous studies generally focused on the ε2, ε3 and ε4 haplotype and did not take associations with the individual Arg158Cys and Cys112Arg into account.
21767357:46	In line with our study, the ε4 isoform was associated with a more detrimental metabolic profile in most studies.
21767357:47	A meta-analysis of 19 studies in 9751 subjects, showed that ε3/ε4 carriers had lower HDL-cholesterol levels than ε3/ε3 carriers . Most studies showed either a positive [ - ] or no [ - ] association between the ε4 isoform and body weight.
21767357:48	However, some showed a negative association . Arbones Mainar et al.  showed that compared to ApoE3 mice, ApoE4 mice fed a western diet were more prone to the development of several MetS features, such as increased insulin resistance, decreased fat tolerance and increased fat cell size.
21767357:49	However, they gained less body weight.
21767357:50	This suggests that the positive association between the ε4 isoform and abdominal obesity may be driven by the development of other MetS features, such as insulin resistance . Furthermore, these results suggest that the ε4 isoform may be associated with MetS.
21767357:51	This has indeed been shown in other epidemiological studies [ , ].
21767357:52	Strength of our pathway driven candidate gene study was the relatively large sample size.
21767357:53	Contrast and precision were increased by exclusively including people with consistent MetS phenotype, i.e. classified as healthy or not healthy for a particular metabolic phenotype over two measurement rounds.
21767357:54	Furthermore we tried to keep the probability of chance findings low by including only those SNPS that were related to two or more MetS features with P < 0.01 into the second round of data-analysis.
21767357:55	We found 2 SNPs, which differed significantly from the expected 0.12 SNPs (p < 0.005 chi-square with Yates correction).
21767357:56	However, the 0.12 expected SNPs were obtained assuming independent random outcomes.
21767357:57	As HDL-cholesterol and abdominal obesity are not completely independent, this assumption is partly violated.
21767357:58	However, the associations with abdominal obesity and HDL-cholesterol remained significant in our stratified and adjusted analyses.
21767357:59	A weakness of our study may be that blood samples were taken from non-fasting subjects.
21767357:60	This may have randomly affected the glucose measurements.
21767357:61	Another weakness is that triglycerides levels were not measured in our study.
21767357:62	Therefore, we may have missed SNPs which were related to hypertriglyceridemia and one or two other MetS feature.
21767357:63	For example, the CETP Ile405Val mutation has been associated with triglycerides in previous studies . We therefore expect that in our study population this SNP will not only be associated with HDL-cholesterol and abdominal obesity, but also with triglyceride levels.
21767357:64	In this explorative study of 373 SNPs among 3575 subjects, we emphasized on the intricate links between several MetS features.
21767357:65	We have showed that two SNPs, mainly known for their role in lipid metabolism, influenced both abdominal obesity and low HDL-cholesterol levels, partly independent of each phenotype.
21767357:66	If the pleiotropic effects of these genes are further confirmed by others it might be possible to develop medication which increases HDL-cholesterol leves and reduces waist circumference, and so affects the development of MetS

18507829:0	Background 
To optimize means to find the best solution, the best compromise among several conflicting demands subject to predefined requirements (called constraints).
18507829:1	Mathematical optimization has been extremely successful as an aid to better decision making in science, engineering and economics.
18507829:2	Optimization and optimality are certainly not new concepts in biology.
18507829:3	The structures, movements and behaviors of animals, and their life histories, have been shaped by the optimizing processes of evolution or of learning by trial and error .
18507829:4	Moreover, optimization theory not only explains current adaptations of biological systems, but also helps to predict new designs that may yet evolve . The use of optimization in the close fields of computational biology and bioinformatics has been reviewed recently elsewhere . Here, I aim to illustrate the capabilities, opportunities and benefits that mathematical optimization can bring to research in systems biology.
18507829:5	First, I will introduce several basic concepts that can help readers unfamiliar with mathematical optimization.
18507829:6	The key elements of mathematical optimization problems are the decision variables (those which can be varied during the search of the best solution), the objective function (the performance index which quantifies the quality of a solution defined by a set of decision variables, and which can be maximized or minimized), and the constraints (requirements that must be met, usually expressed as equalities and inequalities).
18507829:7	Decision variables can be continuous (represented by real numbers), resulting in continuous optimization problems, or discrete (represented by integer numbers), resulting in integer optimization (also called combinatorial optimization ) problems.
18507829:8	In many instances, there is a mix of continuous and integer decision variables.
18507829:9	As an illustrative example, consider the "diet problem", one of the first modern optimization problems , studied in the 1940s: to find the cheapest combination of foods that will satisfy all the daily nutritional requirements of a person.
18507829:10	In this classical problem, the objective function to minimize is the cost of the food, the decision variables are the amounts of each type of food to be purchased (assumed as continuous variables), and the constraints are the nutritional needs be satisfied, like total calories, or amounts of vitamins, minerals, etc., in the diet.
18507829:11	The "diet problem" has certain interesting properties: it is a continuous problem where both the objective function (total cost, i.e. sum of the costs of each food purchased) and the constraints are linear with respect to the decision variables, so this problem belongs to the important class of linear programming, or LP (note that due to historical reasons, programming is used here in the sense of planning).
18507829:12	These linear constraints define a feasible space (space of decision variables where constraints are satisfied) which is a convex polyhedron, so it is a convex problem.
18507829:13	Convex optimization problems  are particularly interesting, since they have a unique solution (i.e. they are unimodal) and they can be solved very efficiently and reliably, even for very large number of decisions variables.
18507829:14	Non linear programming (NLP) deals with continuous problems where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear.
18507829:15	In contrast to LP, NLP problems are much more difficult to solve.
18507829:16	Further, the presence of nonlinearities in the objective and constraints might imply nonconvexity, which results in the potential existence of multiple local solutions (multimodality).
18507829:17	Thus, in nonconvex problems one should seek the globally optimal solution among the set of possible local solutions.
18507829:18	For the simple case of only two decision variables, one can visualize the objective function of a multimodal problem as a terrain with multiple peaks.
18507829:19	Simple examples of unimodal and multimodal surfaces are presented in Figure . 
The solution of multimodal problems is studied by the subfield of global optimization [ - ].
18507829:20	Many continuous problems and the vast majority of combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class.
18507829:21	Most problems in global optimization are very hard to solve exactly in a reasonable computation time.
18507829:22	Fortunately, recent developments indicate that convex optimization problems are more prevalent in practice than was previously thought . Thus, it is highly desirable to formulate (or re-formulate) the statement of any optimization problem as a convex one.
18507829:23	The book by Boyd and Vandenberghe  gives detailed information on how to recognize, formulate, and solve convex optimization problems.
18507829:24	Model-based optimization is a key methodology in engineering, helping in the design, analysis, construction and operation of all kind of devices.
18507829:25	Since engineering approaches are playing a significant role in the rapid evolution of systems biology [ - ], it is expected that mathematical optimization methods will contribute in a significant way to advances in systems biology.
18507829:26	In fact, optimization is already playing a key rôle.
18507829:27	Examples of applications of optimization in systems biology, classified by the type of optimization problem, are given in Table . Below, I highlight several topics where optimization has already made significant contributions.
18507829:28	Optimization of biochemical reaction networks 
Optimization methods have been applied in both metabolic control analysis  and biochemical systems theory . Further, optimization (and, more in particular, linear programming) has been the engine behind metabolic flux balance analysis, where the optimal flux distributions are calculated using linear optimization, and are used to represent the metabolic phenotype for certain conditions.
18507829:29	This flux balance methodology provides a guide to metabolic engineering and a method for bioprocess optimization . Examples of success stories are the in silico predictions of Escherichia coli metabolic capabilities , or the genome-scale reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network . 
Metabolic engineering exploits an integrated, systems-level approach for optimizing a desired cellular property or phenotype . New optimization-based methods are being developed by using genome-scale metabolic models, which enable identification of gene knockout strategies for obtaining improved phenotypes.
18507829:30	However, these problems have a combinatorial nature, so the computational time increases exponentially with the size of the problem for exact methods, so there is a clear need of developing approximate yet faster algorithms . Not surprisingly, optimization will also help in the bioengineering of novel in vitro metabolic pathways using synthetic biology, as the key component in rational redesign and directed evolution [ - ].
18507829:31	Coupling constraint-based analysis with optimization has been used to generate a consistent framework for the generation of hypotheses and the testing of functions of microbial cells using genome-scale models . Extensions and modifications of flux balance analysis continue to use optimization methods extensively [ - ].
18507829:32	A particularly interesting question in this context concerns the principles behind the optimal metabolic network operation, i.e . "which are the criteria (objective functions) being optimized in these networks?", a question which has been addressed in detail recently . Constrained evolutionary optimization has also been used to understand optimal circuit design .
18507829:33	Moreover, optimization principles have also been used to explain the complexity and robustness found in biochemical networks [ - ], and much more work in this topic is to be expected in the near future.
18507829:34	Related to this, the hypothesis that metabolic systems have evolved optimal strategies as a result of evolutionary pressures has been used in cybernetic models , an approach which may offer advantages over traditional methodologies.
18507829:35	Reverse engineering, modeling and experimental design 
Reverse engineering in systems biology aims to reconstruct the biochemical interactions from data sets of a particular biological system.
18507829:36	Optimization has been used for inferring important biomolecular networks, such as e.g. transcriptional regulatory networks , gene regulatory networks [ - ], signaling pathways  and protein interaction networks . 
System identification  is a methodology widely used in engineering for building mathematical models of dynamical systems based on measured data.
18507829:37	Roughly, this involves selected the structure of the model and estimating the parameters of such model from the available experimental data.
18507829:38	The problem of parameter estimation in biochemical pathways, formulated as a nonlinear programming problem subject to the pathway model acting as constraints, has also received great attention [ - ].
18507829:39	Since these problems are frequently multimodal, global optimization methods are needed in order to avoid local solutions.
18507829:40	A local solution can be very misleading when calibrating models: it would indicate a bad fit even for a model which could potentially match perfectly a set of experimental data.
18507829:41	Since biological experiments are both expensive and time consuming, it would be ideal if one could plan them in an optimal way, i.e. minimizing their cost while maximizing the amount of information to be extracted from such experiments.
18507829:42	This is the purpose of optimal experimental design and optimal identification procedures [ - ], a topic which can make a great impact in the near future, especially in connection with high-throughput techniques.
18507829:43	Conclusion 
Although, as already mentioned, it would be desirable to formulate all the optimization problems as convex ones, in many occasions this is not possible, so we face the solution of global optimization problems, most of which belong to the class of NP-hard problems , where obtaining global optima with guarantees will be impossible in many instances.
18507829:44	In these situations, approximate techniques like stochastic global optimization can at least locate a near globally optimal solution in a reasonable time, although the cost to pay is that these methods do not offer full guarantees of global optimality.
18507829:45	In this context, evolutionary computation methods are a class of stochastic methods which have shown good performance in systems biology applications [ - ].
18507829:46	Hybrid methods, combining global and local techniques, have also shown great potential with difficult problems like parameter estimation [ , ].
18507829:47	Much more work is needed to further enhance the efficiency and robustness of these approaches in order to make then applicable to large scale models.
18507829:48	Another important issue is the stochasticity that is inherent in biomolecular systems . This stochastic nature requires advances in optimization methods, and a number of researches are already providing useful approaches, such as in parameter estimation in stochastic biochemical reactions  or in the optimization of stochastic gene network models . 
As stated in , it would be desirable to have computer-aided design tools for biological engineering, similarly to what already happens in many other areas of engineering.
18507829:49	Such software would guide the improvement of the behaviour of a biological system in silico by optimizing design parameters targeting a selected objective function.
18507829:50	The optimization of such synthetic biological systems is in fact receiving increasing attention: optimization algorithms could search for the components (promoters, operators, regulatory proteins, inducers, etc.) and find the best configurations optimizing the dynamic behaviour according to predefined design objectives . A promising example of what can be done is the OptCircuit framework , which can be used as an optimization-based design platform to aid in the construction and fine tuning of integrated biological circuits.
18507829:51	Other researches are adapting the workflow developed by the electronics industry to the design and assembly of very large scale integrated genetic systems, claiming that the computer assisted design and fabrication of genetic systems will be a reality by 2012 .
18507829:52	Moreover, optimization could also be used after the design and construction phases, inside a model predictive control framework , to optimally manipulate the resulting biological systems.
18507829:53	This is the dream of metabolic engineering  and synthetic biology [ , ].
18507829:54	We are still not there, but the purpose of this paper has been to show that we are getting close.
18507829:55	Several issues must be addressed before we reach that goal.
18507829:56	First, we need robust and efficient methods for optimization under uncertainty, and for the optimization of stochastic models, that are also able to scale-up, hopefully even at the level of genome-scale models.
18507829:57	Second, since neither we nor nature rarely have a single objective, we need multicriteria optimization methods that are better able to cope with the scale and complexity of models from systems biology .
18507829:58	Finally, it should be recognized that standard optimization can be sometimes insufficient for gaining deeper insights regarding certain aspects of systems biology, such as in the evolution of biological systems.
18507829:59	While evolving towards optimal properties, the environment may change or organisms may even change their own environment, which in turn alters the optimum.
18507829:60	In an evolutionary system, continuing development is needed so as to maintain its fitness relative to the systems it is co-evolving with.
18507829:61	In other words, everyone has to keep improving in order to survive, which is known as the "Red Queen" effect . Thus, game-theoretic approaches, such as evolutionary game theory , may provide a better framework studying the evolution of biochemical systems.
18507829:62	Sutherland  claims that, in a context of increasing calls for biology to be predictive, optimization is the only approach biology has for making predictions from first principles.
18507829:63	This claim is substantiated by an increasing body of research.
18507829:64	We should expect, therefore, even wider use of optimization theory and practice in systems biology.
21694985:0	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study was a prospective study, approved by the institutional ethical committee of JSS College of Pharmacy, Mysore.
21694985:1	This study was conducted at the JSS Community Pharmacy of JSS College of Pharmacy, Mysore.
21694985:2	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Forty eight community pharmacists were registered for the CPD programme.
21694985:3	Majority (45) participants were male, the mean age of the pharmacists was 36.41±7.17
21694985:4	y and mean duration of practice was 11.5±6.25 y.
21694985:5	Of the 48 enrolled pharmacists, majority (93.75%) of pharmacists were qualified with D.
21694985:6	Pharm, an entry level qualification to practice as pharmacist and only three (6.25%) pharmacists were pharmacy graduates.
21694985:7	The details of the participants are presented in . 
In our study, the post training KAP scores were improved significantly from baseline with p value of less than 0.05 which is significant.
21694985:8	Before attending the CPD programme the mean KAP scores of pharmacists was 13.77±3.51 and it was improved to 23.27±3.25 after providing training.
21694985:9	This significant improvement was may be due to the improvement of knowledge during the training.
21694985:10	Prior to the CPD programme, all the respondents were not knowing about the professional skills such as patient counseling, health screening services and ADR detection, management and reporting.
21694985:11	But after the training, during skills assessment evaluation a significant improvement was observed in patient counseling scores and ADR reporting.
21694985:12	The results of KAP are presented in . 
Another important finding of our study was that before administration of KAP questionnaire none of the pharmacists were aware of the concept of CPD which resulted in low scoring of pharmacists in pre-training KAP questionnaire.
21694985:13	The significant improvement in post training KAP scores was due to awareness created during the study period among pharmacists towards the concept of CPD.
21694985:14	From the post training KAP scores it may be concluded that, this change is due to the participation of pharmacists in CPD programme where they were motivated towards professional practices rather than being traders.
21694985:15	At every CPD session, the impact of CPD session on knowledge of pharmacists was assessed using suitably designed pre and post training questionnaires.
21694985:16	In every CPD session statistically significant improvement in pharmacists’ knowledge was observed.
21694985:17	The pre and post training scores in each CPD session is presented in .
21694985:18	The study results have shown that the percentage improvement from baseline was improved to 12.91% (pharmaceutical care), 13.63% (health screening services), 15.2% (drug-interactions), 21.25% (HIV and AIDS), 17.4% (diabetes mellitus), 20% (tuberculosis), 23.3% (hypertension), 34.06% (asthma), 20% (peptic ulcer disease) and 15.8% (iron deficiency anaemia).
21694985:19	This indicates that the CPD sessions had helped the pharmacists to gain more knowledge regarding diseases and pharmaceutical care services which is an essential element during the practice as a professional.
21694985:20	The data on percentage improvement is presented in . 
Patient counselling is considered as an important responsibility of community pharmacists and is mandated by law in some countries.
21694985:21	Although in India, counseling is not legalised but if pharmacists wish to offer counseling to their patients certainly this service will increase their customer patronage and in turn an increased sales.
21694985:22	A study reported by Kansanaho et al, . assessed the impact of continuing education (CE) course on pharmacists’ patient counselling skills.
21694985:23	The study involved seventeen community pharmacists.
21694985:24	The participants expressed that the CE course had helped them to learn new skills and knowledge in patient counselling.
21694985:25	In our study it was observed that the patient counseling skills were improved to an extent of 24.4% from baseline.
21694985:26	The mean pre-training score was 72.2±12.96 which was improved to 120.9±12.68
21694985:27	after training.
21694985:28	During the study period, a total of sixty three patients benefited from the counseling session.
21694985:29	This suggests that training to community pharmacists on patient counseling not only improved the skills of pharmacists but also helped them to counsel their patients which ultimately resulted in achieving positive health outcomes.
21694985:30	Community pharmacies are the first point of contact on matters related to drugs and drug use.
21694985:31	Community pharmacists by virtue of their skills in drug and disease state management and education, may provide screening services to patients.
21694985:32	In our study, about 89.58 % of pharmacists were unaware of health screening services which can be provided in the community pharmacy.
21694985:33	This percentage was reduced to 4.16% after participating in CPD programmes.
21694985:34	We assessed the CBG recording skills of enrolled pharmacists at baseline and after providing the training.
21694985:35	Most of the pharmacists were engaged only in selling of glucometer in their pharmacies.
21694985:36	By end of the study, it was observed that about 25 (52%) pharmacists were engaged in CBG recording in their pharmacies.
21694985:37	At baseline, the mean pre-training score in recording CBG was 4.75±0.4443 and was improved to 6.000 after the training was given.
21694985:38	The data on professional services is presented in 
The pharmacists expressed that this change not only increased their financial income but also fulfilled the needs of poor patients who can not afford to own a glucometer.
21694985:39	In addition, this approach helped pharmacists to monitor health out comes of their patients.
21694985:40	A study was conducted in Australia by Krass et al .,  for assessing the benefits of diabetic screening services in community pharmacies.
21694985:41	This study involved 30 pharmacies and total of 1,286 patients were screened.
21694985:42	About 1.7% of patients who were screened using finger prick test for capillary blood glucose were diagnosed to have diabetes.
21694985:43	In another study conducted by Valerie et al .,  the community pharmacy based diabetic education programme improved the clinical profile of 381 patients who were enrolled into the programme.
21694985:44	The results of this study shown that hemoglobin A 1Cresults, fasting blood glucose levels, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements and diabetes knowledge scores were improved statistically.
21694985:45	Authors concluded that the community pharmacies may serve as the centre for provision of diabetic education and screening to the patients.
21694985:46	In our study 473 individuals were screened for diabetes mellitus through CBG measurement and it was found that about 47 (9.93%) individuals were found to have high blood glucose levels (newly detected) and were referred to physicians for further diagnosis and management.
21694985:47	A study conducted by Wandikayi et al .,  assessed the pharmacists’ knowledge regarding the accuracy of BP measurement devices and their knowledge regarding high BP and resources for self measurement of BP.
21694985:48	The study involved 174 community pharmacists of which only 25 pharmacists identified the correct procedure for checking the accuracy of the devices and correctly identify the cut off points for systolic and diastolic BP.
21694985:49	In our study, we observed that the BP measurement skills of the participants were improved by 43.12% from the baseline.
21694985:50	At base line the mean pre-training score in measuring BP was 4.55±0.83 and was improved to 8.00 after training was given.
21694985:51	These results suggest that pharmacists are capable of serving the community by providing health screening services like CBG recording and BP measurements if they are properly trained.
21694985:52	In addition to the provision of patient counseling and health screening services, detection, and management and reporting of ADRs is also considered as an important professional service of the pharmacist to the community.
21694985:53	At baseline about 21 (56.25%) pharmacists were unaware of concept of ADRs.
21694985:54	This percentage was reduced to 4.16% after the CPD programme.
21694985:55	In a study reported from Jamaica, Gossell-Williams and Adebayo assessed the attitudes of community pharmacists to report ADRs.
21694985:56	The study results have shown that of 102 community pharmacists who were participated in the study, 67% were not aware of ADR reporting, but 86% of participants strongly agreed that ADR reporting was a professional responsibility.
21694985:57	A total of 45 reports were collected in a three month prospective follow up.
21694985:58	Authors conclude that the awareness of ADR reporting among participants is inadequate.
21694985:59	However, continuous training and motivation may help the pharmacists to actively participate in ADR reporting.
21694985:60	In our study, during the CPD training on ADR detection, management and reporting, incidences of ADRs, influence of ADRs on budget and health outcomes was discussed and briefed about the roles of community pharmacists in reporting the ADRs.
21694985:61	During the study period a total of 23 ADRs were reported through the pink form which was designed for reporting suspected ADRs by community pharmacists.
21694985:62	The reported ADRs were then analysed for causality using WHO causality scale.
21694985:63	twenty (86.95%)
21694985:64	ADRs belong to *probable, 2 (8.69%) ADRs belong to *certain and one (4.34%)
21694985:65	ADR belongs to *possible category on WHO causality scale.
21694985:66	The data on ADR reports is presented in .
21694985:67	A study was conducted by Rouleau et al .,  to assess the impact of an asthma CE program provided to community pharmacists on their knowledge, intervention frequency and the appropriateness of asthma medication use.
21694985:68	The results of this study have shown that following a CE program the pharmacists’ knowledge was improved but the practice of pharmacists was not improved to an extent of achieving statistically significant difference.
21694985:69	But in our study it was found that most of the pharmacists not only improved their professional knowledge and skills but also started to implement these knowledge and skills in their practice.
21694985:70	This change may be due to the influence of CPD program.
21694985:71	In addition to improved knowledge, it was also observed that most of the pharmacists started engaging in provision of different community pharmacy services such as patient counseling, CBG recording, BP measurement and ADR reporting in their pharmacies.
21694985:72	In UK, a prospective longitudinal study was conducted by Raisa et al .,  with the aim of exploring community pharmacists’ perceptions on individual factors influencing engagement in CPD.
21694985:73	The participants of study expressed that the three main barriers for engaging in CPD were lack of information about CPD, lack of motivation and lack of time.
21694985:74	In our study few pharmacists expressed the similar kind of barriers in implementing the community pharmacy services.
21694985:75	The most important barrier was found to be lack of time, lack of space in the pharmacy to provide community pharmacy services and lack of economic benefits.
21694985:76	Self motivation is the best strategy in order to overcome these barriers.
21694985:77	Pharmacists were motivated to plan their work appropriately so that they can find time to serve the community as a Health Care Professional by engaging in provision of different community pharmacy services.
21694985:78	As stated by FIP, “Participation of each individual in structured CPD is essential for all practising pharmacists and that results in continuous improvement in skills performance which is necessary for patient care, contemporary and competent practice, which in turn helps for flexible career choices, career satisfaction and ultimately improves patient health care outcomes”.
21694985:79	In our study, the overall results suggest that participation of community pharmacists in the CPD programmes improved their knowledge and skills, which helped them to perform better as a health care professional in the community.
21694985:80	In addition, pharmacists expressed that practice of community pharmacy services in their pharmacies such as patient counseling and health screening services helped them in developing good rapport with their patients which in turn increased the patient patronage to their pharmacies.
21694985:81	The present study has shown that the knowledge, attitude and practice of the pharmacists towards professional responsibilities were improved.
21694985:82	Significant improvements were observed in post training scores, that has shown impact of CPD programme on knowledge and provision of professional services by the pharmacists.
21694985:83	Our study results imply that continuous motivation and provision of training helps community pharmacists to perform well as professionals in the community.
21694985:84	Pharmacists also realised that only continuous updating of knowledge and skills makes them more confident and able to perform as desired.

DISCUSSION 
This study provides evidence that S. aureus and other bacterial pathogens generate adenosine to promote their survival during host infection.
19808256:1	We identified and characterized AdsA, a cell wall–anchored protein of S. aureus with 5′-nucleotidase signature sequences, and its functional homologue in B.
19808256:2	anthracis . We show that adsA is required for synthesis of adenosine during infection and that the structural gene contributes to the survival of S. aureus and B. anthracis in animal or human blood.
19808256:3	Further, in a renal abscess model of S. aureus infection in mice, adsA was required for pathogen replication in organ tissues and for the formation of abscess lesions.
19808256:4	5′-Nucleotidases are present in many different bacterial species, but their potential as virulence factors has hitherto not been appreciated.
19808256:5	We provide evidence that AdsA may be a clinically relevant virulence factor of CA-MRSA strain USA300, the causative agent of the majority of community-acquired skin and soft-tissue infections in the United States.
19808256:6	previously reported that sasH ( adsA ) was significantly associated with invasive disease isolates as compared with nasal carriage isolates, further distinguishing a pivotal role for adsA in staphylococcal disease.
19808256:7	Although the extraordinary immunosuppressive attributes of adenosine are generally known, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first mechanistic link between bacterial pathogenesis and adenosine synthesis.
19808256:8	S. aureus is primarily an extracellular pathogen, and the main thrust of host defenses against this pathogen relies on PMNs and phagocytic killing.
19808256:9	Adenosine is known to inhibit neutrophil degranulation, adhesion to vascular surfaces, and superoxide burst ( ; ; ).
19808256:10	Our experiments reveal the effect of adenosine on staphylococcal survival in blood at an early stage of infection (30–90 min), when tissue damage and AMP release is limited.
19808256:11	At a later stage of infection, when S. aureus seeds abscesses and causes liquefaction necrosis, AMP levels are expected to increase as a consequence of staphylococcal toxins, e.g., α-hemolysin, leukocidins, or phenol-soluble modulins, that form pores in membranes and precipitate cellular lysis.
19808256:12	We observed further that adsA -deficient S. aureus were cleared more rapidly from the bloodstream of BALB/c mice than wild-type staphylococci, correlating with the reduced ability to grow during infection and/or seed abscesses; presumably, lower numbers of adsA mutant staphylococci can disseminate through the vasculature and form abscess lesions.
19808256:13	In addition to neutrophils, tissue macrophages are essential for the clearance of bacterial infections.
19808256:14	Adenosine directly impairs the ability of macrophages to combat infection by decreasing the phagocytic activity of these cells.
19808256:15	Further, adenosine attenuates macrophage antibacterial activity by suppressing the production of superoxide and nitric oxide ( ; ), both of which are integral to the killing of phagocytosed bacteria.
19808256:16	Macrophage deactivation by adenosine also suppresses antibacterial defense mechanisms by decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines that both orchestrate inflammatory/immune functions of other cell types and act as regulators of macrophage function.
19808256:17	For example, TNF is a regulator of neutrophil, endothelial cell, and lymphocyte function, and the production of TNF has been shown to be under negative control of adenosine.
19808256:18	Finally, an important consideration is that adenosine, through the activation of macrophages, may decrease T cell antibacterial effector mechanisms.
19808256:19	In support of this conjecture, adenosine decreases the expression of MHC II on macrophages and dendritic cells, and it decreases macrophage production of IL-12, a pivotal stimulus for Th1-type immune responses.
19808256:20	Examination of the genomes of Gram-positive bacteria identified genes with similarities to putative 5′-nucleotidases.
19808256:21	Many of these proteins harbor sortase A–specific sorting signals (LPXTG), indicating that their mature products are localized in the bacterial cell-wall envelope.
19808256:22	Such localization appears relevant, as surface-exposed adenosine synthases should release their product in close proximity to phagocytic cells.
19808256:23	Other microorganisms secrete 5′-nucleotidases into the extracellular environment, as recent studies have described a panel of nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes secreted by Trichinella spiralis parasites and Vibrio cholerae a Gram-negative pathogen.
19808256:24	Collectively, our results suggest that S. aureus and other Gram-positive pathogens increase extracellular concentrations of the potent immunosuppressive molecule adenosine and, through this mechanism, are likely able to perturb immune defenses and promote their survival in host tissues.
18691438:0	Background 
Molecular studies of angiosperm model plants have identified large numbers of genes that are expressed during stamen and pollen development.
18691438:1	Genetic analyses have revealed the roles of some of these genes in the specification of stamen identity, the regulation of anther cell division and the differentiation of anthers, the control of male meiosis, the development of pollen, and anther dehiscence . Pollen development in gymnosperms and angiosperms involves several similar developmental and physiological processes . Homologs to floral transcription factors in angiosperms have been isolated from gymnosperm strobili and characterized.
18691438:2	For example, the B-class MADS-box genes, which in angiosperms determine petal and stamen identities, and C-class genes that control the identities of stamens and carpels have been identified in conifers [ - ].
18691438:3	The Norway spruce gene DAL1 belongs to the AGL6 subfamily and DAL10 belongs to gymnosperm-specific subgroup were identified as other MADS-box genes in conifers . The flowering time gene, SOC1 and LEAFY and A class gene APETALA2 have also been identified [ - ].
18691438:4	However, available information about transcripts that are expressed in the male reproductive structures of the gymnosperms is still limited . 
The gymnosperm Cryptomeria is a monoecious plant that is distributed throughout Japan and in some parts of China.
18691438:5	Cryptomeria japonica D.
18691438:6	Don is widely grown in Japan because of its high productivity and utility.
18691438:7	This species comprises 18% of the forests and covers 12% of the landmass of Japan.
18691438:8	However, allergic reactions to its pollen have become a severe public health problem in Japan.
18691438:9	A recent nationwide epidemiological survey found that at least 13% of the Japanese population suffers from pollinosis due to pollen of C. japonica . 
The male strobili of C. japonica develop in axils of small branches near the tips of these branches.
18691438:10	The primordia of male strobili are initiated from June to August and first become visible from July to September under natural conditions .
18691438:11	The development of strobili can also be initiated by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA 3).
18691438:12	The promotion of flower formation by exogenous GA 3 occurs even in one-year-old seedlings in spite of the fact that formation of strobili usually requires around 20 years after germination under natural conditions . Meiosis of microsporocytes begins in the middle of October, and microspores are formed from late October to late November.
18691438:13	Differentiation of generative cells and tube cells occurs in December.
18691438:14	The staminate strobili then remain in an arrested state of development until the following March when pollen grains are released.
18691438:15	Each male strobilus is oval, pale yellow, and close to 5 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter, and each consists of microsporophylls attached to a main axis.
18691438:16	Three to five rounded microsporangia develop on the lower surface of each microsporophyll.
18691438:17	Each microsporangium contains 3,000 or more pollen grains, and as many as 400,000 pollen grains may be produced in a single strobilus . 
Large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) should help us to clarify the overall expression of genes in the male strobili of C. japonica . Some ESTs have already been derived from male strobili and from the pollen of C. japonica .
18691438:18	However, the numbers of ESTs were relatively small, namely, 739 from male strobili and 3,655 from pollen, and most isolated cDNAs were not full-length.
18691438:19	In the present study, we constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library using RNA derived from male strobili at various developmental stages, and we obtained more than 30,000 ESTs.
18691438:20	We performed sequence-similarity searches using TBLASTX and BLASTX to compare the ESTs from C. japonica male strobili to sequences in UniProt, amino acid sequences from Arabidopsis and rice ( Oryza sativa L.), and EST sequences from poplar, spruce and pine.
18691438:21	We also identified ESTs that encoded MADS-box genes, which play a variety of important developmental roles in plants.
18691438:22	In this report, we discuss both the utility of full-length cDNAs for gene discovery and the characterization of MADS-box genes in C. japonica .
18691438:23	Results 
Discussion 
The genomes of gymnosperm species are usually large and replete with highly repetitive sequences.
18691438:24	The haploid DNA content of C. japonica was estimated to correspond to 11 pg of DNA .
18691438:25	This value is about half of the mean value for Pinaceae species , but about eighty times that of the Arabidopsis genome.
18691438:26	EST analysis is a low-cost approach to characterization of the coding component of the genome.
18691438:27	ESTs derived from several tissues of C. japonica were analyzed previously [ , ].
18691438:28	However, most of the previously analyzed ESTs were not full-length.
18691438:29	Full-length cDNAs are essential for the determination of sites of initiation of transcription and the functional analysis of genes . In the present study, we constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library from C. japonica male strobili at various stages of development.
18691438:30	To our knowledge, this is the first report of a full-length enriched cDNA library from a gymnosperm.
18691438:31	In fact, the information of 6,464 Sitka spruce full-length cDNA sequences were registered in GenBank (accession numbers to ), but it has not been published.
18691438:32	These full-length cDNAs should be a valuable tool for gene discovery and analysis in gymnosperms.
18691438:33	We found that 90% of our cDNA clones included G at the 5' ends (Table ).
18691438:34	The G at the 5' end of full-length cDNA can be explained by the addition of C to the 3' end of full-length first-strand cDNA in a non-template-directed manner by the reverse transcriptase . Our observation of bias towards G at the 5' end of cDNAs is consistent with the addition of C to the 3' end of full-length cDNAs.
18691438:35	The sequences of 5' ends imply that our cDNA library had been enriched for full-length cDNA clones.
18691438:36	We also found that the second nucleotide of most cDNAs at their 5' termini was a purine nucleotide, which is common at sites of initiation of transcription in Arabidopsis and rice .
18691438:37	This result suggests that a purine nucleotide is common at sites of initiation of transcription in C. japonica as well as Arabidopsis and rice.
18691438:38	However, further studies about the comparison between genome sequences and the full-length cDNAs are needed to identify the sequence characteristics around the transcription start site in C. japonica . 
We isolated 36,011 ESTs from either one or both ends of 19,437 cDNA clones.
18691438:39	These ESTs were clustered into 23,658 consensus sequences (7,686 tentative contigs and 15,972 singletons) by PHRAP.
18691438:40	The redundancy is extremely low compared with assemblies of ESTs derived from other conifers.
18691438:41	In previous studies, the assembly of 49,101 ESTs derived from 16 cDNA libraries from different tissues of white spruce resulted in 16,578 consensus sequences , and that of 59,797 ESTs from wood-forming tissues of loblolly pine represented 20,377 consensus sequences . The normalization step in the generation of our cDNA library contributed the high rate of gene discovery.
18691438:42	We obtained 10,463 transcripts after a round-robin BLASTN search and clustering of 5'- and 3'-end sequences derived from the same respective clones.
18691438:43	We found that 1,317 transcripts (12.6%) did not exhibit any similarity in terms of predicted amino acid sequences to those encoded by Arabidopsis and rice genomes or to those derived from Pinus, Picea and Populus ESTs using BLASTX and TBLASTX ( E- value > 1e-5).
18691438:44	These results indicate that the ESTs generated in the present study have added to the known complement of gymnosperm transcripts.
18691438:45	We classified and annotated the transcripts isolated in this study (Fig. ; Table ; Additional file ).
18691438:46	In our functional classification, categories with no concrete assignment, such as "prediction of general function only", "function unknown" and "unassigned", accounted for a large fraction of transcripts (Fig. ).
18691438:47	Among assigned pollen transcripts of C. japonica close to 31% of the predicted proteins are involved in the synthesis and modification of proteins, which are categorized as J and O .
18691438:48	However, the percentage in those categories was only approximately 14% in the present study.
18691438:49	The difference might be due to the large population of transcripts in the present study and/or to the specific characteristics of the male strobili of C. japonica . Table shows the functional annotation of the most abundant families identified in this study.
18691438:50	Protein kinase, cytochrome P450, and the RNA recognition motif were the most frequent domains.
18691438:51	These domains are also present at relatively high levels in deduced products of the genome of Arabidopsis . We also found that the numbers of transcripts that encoded certain protein families or domains, such as NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, the C3HC4 type zinc finger, the WD domain, aspartyl proteases and aldo/keto reductases, were larger than those that encoded the corresponding protein families or domains in the Arabidopsis genome.
18691438:52	In general, the degree of complexity of multigene families seems to be correlated with the size of the plant genome.
18691438:53	Southern hybridization patterns and comparative sequence analysis of conserved ortholog sets suggested that genomes of gymnosperms include complex families of genes . Our results suggest the increased complexity of gene families in C. japonica as compared to Arabidopsis .
18691438:54	Since the number of cDNA clones in the present study was insufficient to allow us to prove this hypothesis and since the complete sequence of each clone has not been determined, further studies are needed to clarify the complexity of gene families in C. japonica . 
We also searched potential candidates for novel allergens in C. japonica . In previous study, we analyzed similarity of the deduced proteins encoded by ESTs derived from C. japonica pollen and known plant allergens, and found cDNA clones that encoded proteins similar to six types of pollen allergens, eight types of food allergens and three types of latex allergens . In the present study, we found 180 transcripts that encoded proteins similar to 22 pollen allergens including all of five known allergens in C. japonica (Table ).
18691438:55	The major allergens in C. japonica are known to have similarity to pollen allergens of other plants . The existence of numerous allergens in C. japonica pollen has been suggested but only a few antigens have been identified.
18691438:56	These newly deduced proteins in C. japonica are potential candidates for novel plant allergens.
18691438:57	In this study, we identified 207 transcripts that encoded Pfam domains of transcription factors, including those encoded by MADS-box genes.
18691438:58	In plants, MADS-box genes are involved in various aspects of vegetative and reproductive growth, including the morphogenesis of flowers.
18691438:59	Plant MADS-box genes are classified into types I and II . Most of plant type II genes have three more domains than type I, namely, an intervening (I) domain, a keratin-like (K) domain, and a C-terminal (C) domain.
18691438:60	The plant type II genes are divided into two types based on the intron structure, namely, MIKC C- and MIKC*-type genes . The MIKC C-type genes can be subdivided into several well-defined gene clades, known as 'subfamilies' . We found twelve MADS-box genes derived from transcripts from male strobili of C. japonica one of which was a type I gene while the other eleven were MIKC C-type genes.
18691438:61	The MIKC C-type genes in C. japonica could be subdivided into five subfamilies: DEF/GLO/GGM13-, TM8-, AG-, AGL6- and TM3 -like genes.
18691438:62	To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify type I genes and TM8 -like genes in a gymnosperm.
18691438:63	Functional characterization of type I genes in plants has been very limited to date.
18691438:64	The type I gene in C. japonica (CMFL_009_N22) was most similar to AGL80 which is required for development of the central cell of the female gametophyte . The functions of type I genes in reproductive organs in C. japonica remain to be determined.
18691438:65	The MADS-box gene family has been subjected to a model of birth-and death evolution . TM8 -like genes have been found in rosids (Cucurbitaceae) and asterids (Solanaceae) but not in Arabidopsis . A recent review noted that TM8 -like genes exist in the basalmost angiosperms (Amborellaceae) and in magnoliids (Lauraceae) . We found evidence for at least one TM8 -like gene in Cryptomeria (Cupressaceae sensu lato).
18691438:66	None has been reported in Pinaceae to date, to our knowledge.
18691438:67	These results suggest that TM8 -like genes were established in the common ancestor of angiosperms and gymnosperms and that they have been lost relatively recently in some lineages.
18691438:68	It seems likely that the rate of birth-and-death evolution of TM8 -like genes has been high.
18691438:69	We identified six DEF/GLO/GGM13- like genes in this study.
18691438:70	DEF - and GLO -like genes are known as B-class MADS genes, which are key regulators of petal and stamen specification in model species of angiosperms, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus and Petunia hybrida.
18691438:71	GGM13- like genes are the sister lineage of the B-class genes and are, hence, also known as Bsister (Bs) genes . Bs genes are expressed mainly in female reproductive organs and a member of the Bs gene family is involved in development of the seed coat . B-class and Bs genes were treated as one clade in the present study.
18691438:72	Three genes (CMFL_009_E12, CMFL_023_G10, CMFL_052_L02) seem to be ancestral DEF - and GLO -like genes, while the other three genes (CMFL_007_I11, CMFL_018_D08, CMFL_046_H20) seem to constitute a sister clade of B-class and Bs genes.
18691438:73	Several gene duplications appear to have occurred in the lineage to Cryptomeria after it diverged from other conifers.
18691438:74	The phylogenetic analysis of MADS-box genes in the present study has implications for the evolution of gymnosperms.
18691438:75	The phylogenetic tree of TM3 -like genes indicates that the Gnetales and the Pinaceae are nested as sister groups and that Cryptomeria is a sister of the Gnetales plus Pinaceae clade.
18691438:76	A similar result was obtained for AG -like genes, but the bootstrap support was not very strong.
18691438:77	Our data support those in prior multigene phylogenetic studies that suggested that all conifers, with the exception of Pinaceae, are a sister clade of the Gnetales plus Pinaceae clade . The evolution and divergence of the MADS-box family of genes has been studied extensively.
18691438:78	However, most of the studied MADS-box genes in gymnosperms were derived from Gnetum, Pinus and Picea . The identification and characterization of MADS-box genes in Cryptomeria and other gymnosperms should help us to understand the evolution of the structure of MADS-box genes and their roles in reproductive development.
18691438:79	Conclusion 
We established a full-length enriched cDNA library using RNA derived from male strobili at various developmental stages, and we obtained 36,011 ESTs that was grouped into 10,463 clusters as unique transcripts.
18691438:80	These full-length cDNAs provide information on expression of genes during the development of male reproductive organs.
18691438:81	Our full-length enriched cDNA library will be useful for large-scale gene discovery for studies of gymnosperm species.

20592948:0	ALS: A Multifaceted Disease 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable fatal motoneuron disease with a lifetime risk of 1:800.
20592948:1	It is characterized by progressive weakness, muscle wasting and death ensuing 3–5 years after diagnosis (Mitchell and Borasio, ).
20592948:2	Since the first description of ALS by Charcot, around 150 years ago, and despite tremendous work, the cause(s) of ALS remain(s) unclear.
20592948:3	A number of genes have been identified that, when mutated, cause familial ALS (Valdmanis et al., ). In addition, several polymorphisms have been identified that pose a genetic risk of developing sporadic ALS (Dunckley et al., ; Schymick et al., ).
20592948:4	From these data, and a wealth of pre-clinical and clinical investigations it is clear that the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of ALS is complex with many players involved that lead to the functional decline of the motor pathway (Pasinelli and Brown, ; Rothstein, ).
20592948:5	On the tissue level, it is clear that cells beyond motoneurons are involved in ALS pathophysiology.
20592948:6	This involves astrocytes, which are reactive and apparently toxic in ALS (Schiffer et al., ; Nagai et al., ; Blackburn et al., ).
20592948:7	Also, reactive microglia and protective T-cell infiltration have been noted as players in non-cell-autonomous toxicity (Engelhardt and Appel, ; Xiao et al., ; Beers et al., ). On the motoneuron level, it is a matter of ongoing research where the disease process is initiated, candidates being the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Fischer et al., ), the axon (Collard et al., ; Strom et al., ), mitochondria (Dupuis et al., ; Bacman et al., ; Martin, ), or the cell nucleus (Kinoshita et al., ). On the molecular level, a lot of possible culprits have been followed including glutamate excitotoxicity (Corona et al., ), reactive oxygen species (Carter et al., ), lipid metabolism (Dupuis et al., ), and others.
20592948:8	Currently, the only available treatment option is riluzole that prolongs life by 2–3 months, with questionable functional improvement (Miller et al., ). The broad spectrum of molecular and cellular players in ALS obviously makes drug development difficult.
20592948:9	We argue that in the absence of one specific causative mechanism identified, protection of the motoneuron with multipotent growth factors remains the most rational approach available.
20592948:10	Discovery and Activities of Growth Factors 
The story of growth factors in the nervous system was started by Rita Levi-Montalcini, Viktor Hamburger, and Stanley Cohen with the discovery of the nerve growth factor (NGF) in the 1950’s (Levi-Montalcini and Hamburger, ; Levi-Montalcini et al., ; Cohen and Levi-Montalcini, ; Levi-Montalcini and Cohen, ), for which Levi-Montalcini and Cohen received the Nobel prize in 1986.
20592948:11	Interestingly, the Nobel prize in Medicine and Physiology was awarded for the “discovery of growth factors”, which at that time already acknowledged the scope of their work for opening up a large area of research and potential therapeutic approaches.
20592948:12	Presently, the group of proteins regarded as neurotrophic growth factors has immensely grown, and a lot has been learned about common and specialized activities of these factors.
20592948:13	Some of them, the neurotrophins, were first described as acting on neuronal cells, whereas others, more recently described neurotrophic factors, were initially discovered in a non-neuronal context.
20592948:14	Neurotrophic growth factors have an array of activities in the nervous system that consist of functions in development, plasticity, neurogenesis, disease and injury.
20592948:15	Today it is clear that these activities are reaching far beyond the original “neurotrophic theory”, which postulated that only neurons that encounter these tissue target-derived factors in a critical phase of their development will survive, and that the availability of limited amounts of survival factors is a key factor in the development of the nervous system and other organs.
20592948:16	One essential activity of these factors is an intrinsic autocrine survival effect that is modulated during development (Lamballe et al., ; Valdes-Sanchez et al., ).
20592948:17	Other effects are stimulation of neurite outgrowth and axon guidance (Tuttle and O'Leary, ; Huang and Reichardt, ), securing correct connectivity in the brain and spinal cord.
20592948:18	Moreover, growth factors in the nervous system influence dendrite and synapse formation, thus directly impacting on plasticity mechanisms (Lo, ; Vicario-Abejon et al., ).
20592948:19	An additional basic activity of many growth factors in the nervous system are influences on the proliferation, migration and differentiation of stem cells in the developing and adult nervous system (Cattaneo and McKay, ; Kuipers and Bramham, ).
20592948:20	These basic properties are also employed by the nervous system in the case of disease and injury, and thus constitute a powerful endogenous repair and maintenance system.
20592948:21	The potential for a therapeutic application of these factors has been realized early on, and the last two decades have seen a number of approaches to exploit this potential in several neurological disorders, one of the most prominent being ALS.
20592948:22	In the following we review growth factors that have been studied pre-clinically and clinically in ALS.
20592948:23	Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) together with the related factors NGF, Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and Neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) belongs to the group of “Neurotrophic factors” or “Neurotrophins”, which constitute the most narrowly defined and oldest group of nervous growth factors.
20592948:24	This narrow definition is justified as these factors are all related to the first member of that family (NGF), and share related receptors (trkA,B,C; p75NTR).
20592948:25	BDNF is historically the second neurotrophic factor directly described as such (Barde et al., ). Several groups published promising results on rescuing axotomized motoneurons (Sendtner et al., ; Yan et al., ; Gimenez y Ribotta et al., ) and on improving the phenotype of wobbler mutant mice (Ikeda et al., ), a model for motoneuron disorders (Table ).
20592948:26	In addition, BDNF protects neurons from in vivo excitotoxicity (Bemelmans et al., ), a mode of action of relevance to ALS.
20592948:27	Several clinical studies were conducted after those encouraging data (Table ).
20592948:28	More than 1000 patients were enrolled in a trial published in 1999 (The BDNF Study Group (Phase III) 1999).
20592948:29	In this trial, the tolerability of BDNF was shown to be better than of Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), despite some adverse effects such as diarrhea.
20592948:30	While the results failed to show an amelioration for patients’ condition or survival after treatment with BDNF, it appeared that a subgroup of patients responded positively to the treatment and demonstrated a higher survival rate.
20592948:31	This subgroup consisted of patients having the lowest vital capacity and receiving the highest dose of BDNF, suggesting that BDNF could be beneficial for patients in advanced stages of the disease.
20592948:32	The investigators suggested to use higher doses or intrathecal delivery to deliver BDNF to the diseased spinal cord.
20592948:33	One year later, a phase 1 trial was published, showing the feasibility of intrathecal delivery of BDNF.
20592948:34	Indeed, delivering BDNF with this method leads to a detectable level of BDNF in the cerebrospinal fluid, especially at the lumbar level (Ochs et al., ). The method being feasible, two clinical trial were conducted in 2003 and 2005.
20592948:35	In 2003, eleven ALS patients were enrolled in a trial to receive an intrathecal delivery of BDNF.
20592948:36	Another trial with intrathecal delivery was conducted in 2005 with 13 patients (Kalra et al., ; Beck et al., ). Both trials were too small to detect any meaningful efficacy signal.
20592948:37	The failure of BDNF in clinical trials could be explained by several reasons.
20592948:38	First of all, it remains controversial if and to what degree BDNF passes the BBB (Pardridge et al., ; Poduslo and Curran, ; Pan et al., ), rendering it problematic to treat the spinal cord by subcutaneous delivery.
20592948:39	The lack of any efficacy signals in the relatively small number of patients treated by direct delivery of BDNF to the central nervous system (CNS) might however point to additional problems.
20592948:40	The second concern with BDNF is that it might not have been the most ideal growth factor to test clinically.
20592948:41	It appears that BDNF could have the potential to exacerbate the disease to some extent, as p75, a receptor for BDNF, appears involved in ALS pathophysiology (Lowry et al., ; Dupuis et al., ). Indeed, when p75 is not bound to trk receptors, it might induce apoptosis in both animal models of ALS and patients.
20592948:42	A report in 2004 actually showed that an antagonist for p75 slows progression of ALS in SOD-1 animals (Turner et al., ). Thus, the potential beneficial effect of BDNF could be concealed by the concomitant activation of pro-apoptotic pathways through the p75 receptor.
20592948:43	Doubts in the suitability of BDNF for ALS treatment are also supported by animal experiments conducted after the clinical trials.
20592948:44	A study performed on SOD-1 transgenic mice using a gene therapy approach with BDNF among others neurotrophic factors (Park et al., ) could not observe any positive effects of BDNF neither on disease progression nor on survival, questioning the rationale for clinical trials with BDNF in ALS.
20592948:45	Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor 
After the discovery of NGF, a number of other, unrelated growth factors in the nervous system were discovered, that have a similar scope of activities, but do not belong to the group of “neurotrophins” in its restricted sense.
20592948:46	The most well-known of these are the Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (Lin et al., ) and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Lin et al., ). The history of CNTF in ALS is similar to the one of BDNF.
20592948:47	CNTF was one of the earliest neurotrophic factor shown to have a direct neuroprotective effect on degenerating motoneurons in stress-induced conditions (Table ).
20592948:48	Two studies in 1990 demonstrated that CNTF protects motoneurons in cell culture (Arakawa et al., ), and in vivo after axotomy-induced apoptosis in the rodent (Sendtner et al., ). Those results were strengthened by the beneficial effect of CNTF in a mouse model of neuronopathy with motoneuron degeneration (Sendtner et al., ), and by increased vulnerability of spinal motoneurons in a knock-out mouse line for CNTF (Masu et al., ). These results were published in the early 90s, prior to the development of mutated super oxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) transgenic mice in 1994 (Gurney et al., ), today the most frequently employed mouse model for ALS.
20592948:49	Because of these promising effects on motoneurons, CNTF went directly to the clinic, and became the first growth factor investigated clinically for ALS.
20592948:50	Two clinical trials were conducted in 1996 and enrolled 570 and 730 patients, respectively (Table ).
20592948:51	The investigators focused mainly on daily living activities outcomes and survival (ALS CNTF Treatment Study Group, ; Miller et al., ). Unfortunately, both of those trials reported no observable benefit of treatment.
20592948:52	Moreover, adverse effects, especially for the doses over 5 μg/kg, were severe, leading to the cessation of treatment in many patients.
20592948:53	What could be the reasons to explain the lack of efficiency of CNTF after such promising pre-clinical outcomes?
20592948:54	Apart from possible general aspects of failure discussed further below (e.g. lacking translatability of rodent findings) we see two main specific reasons.
20592948:55	First of all, it has to be pointed out that despite CNTF's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (Pan et al., ), a pharmacokinetic study in the rodent showed that CNTF has a half-life of only 2.9 min after intravenous injection.
20592948:56	Due to this low half-life, subcutaneous application of CNTF appeared not appropriate to target the central nervous system.
20592948:57	Secondly, the doses used in animals were about 1 mg/kg, whereas the highest safe dose in the human is 200 times lower than that (5 μg/kg).
20592948:58	This limited dose and short half-life of CNTF could easily account for the inefficiency of CNTF in patients.
20592948:59	No further clinical projects were pursued with CNTF in ALS after these two trials.
20592948:60	Glial Cell-Line Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was studied a few years later than CNTF and BDNF.
20592948:61	As it was the case for the other neurotrophic factors, the pre-clinical results were encouraging, with rescue of motoneurons after axotomy-induced degeneration and numerous positive in vitro data, (Buj-Bello ; Gimenez y Ribotta et al., ; Bilak et al., ; Kosuge et al., ). including excitotoxity-induced stress (Kosuge et al., ). Unlike BDNF and CNTF, GDNF effects were tested in SOD-1 animals in a number of studies prior to initiation of clinical studies (Table ).
20592948:62	The outcomes of those studies argued for a benefit of GDNF treatment despite several controversial data.
20592948:63	GDNF treated motoneurons of SOD-1 animals are clearly protected (Mohajeri et al., ; Acsadi et al., ; Li et al., ; Suzuki et al., ; Park et al., ). The effects of GDNF on survival and functional outcomes appear more problematic, as well as the rescue of neuromuscular junctions.
20592948:64	While some studies report a benefit on disease progression and/or survival (Mohajeri et al., ; Acsadi et al., ; Li et al., ), others find no effect on disease progression and integrity of neuromuscular junctions (Li et al., ; Suzuki et al., ; Park et al., ).
20592948:65	With respect to extrapolation to the clinic, it has to be mentioned that Park and associates were the only ones who initiated treatment at the onset of the disease, and they observed a protection of motoneurons but not an increase in survival.
20592948:66	Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor has not yet been tested clinically for the treatment of ALS patients.
20592948:67	Clinical observations demonstrated that the level of GDNF is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients (Grundstrom et al., ), and that its receptor is expressed in the spinal cord, even at late stages of the disease (Mitsuma et al., ). Due to its in vivo neuroprotective effects on motoneurons GDNF remains a potential candidate for a clinical trial in ALS, despite controversial efficacy data on survival.
20592948:68	However, as there is evidence that GDNF does not cross the BBB (Kastin et al., ), a future challenge remains in developing a protocol to resolve this issue, such as using an intrathecal delivery device for GDNF.
20592948:69	Although there were signs of biological efficacy of GDNF in Parkinson's disease (PD) (Gill et al., ; Patel et al., ), the further development of direct intracerebral delivery in PD was halted by the originator of the drug due to possible safety issues.
20592948:70	Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 
Beside the classic neurotrophins, other growth factors (“Non-classical’’ neurotrophic factors) show prominent neuronal activity but were first described as acting in other compartments of the body.
20592948:71	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has a multitude of actions and targets in the body, and the discovery of its effect on neurons dates from the end of the 80’s (Shemer et al., ). Neurons in the central nervous systems express functional receptors of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Shemer et al., ). In vitro and in vivo IGF-1 was able to rescue motoneurons (Caroni, ; Li et al., ; Bilak et al., ) and to reduce glutamate excitotoxicity (Nakao et al., ; Vincent et al., ). Therefore IGF-1 became an interesting drug candidate for ALS.
20592948:72	Several clinical studies with IGF-1 in ALS were conducted early, before testing IGF-1 in SOD-1 animals (Table ).
20592948:73	In the late 90’s, two investigations were published with different conclusions (Lai et al., ; Borasio et al., ). Lai et al. enrolled 266 patients and administrated IGF-1 subcutaneously.
20592948:74	The conclusion of the investigators were that IGF-1 is safe, slows progression of motor-impairment, and increases quality of life.
20592948:75	In a second trial, Borasio et al. enrolled 183 patients with the same mode of administration.
20592948:76	The investigators focused on disease progression but found no improvement after treatment.
20592948:77	Indeed, IGF-1 treatment appeared to be safe but did not improve quality of life of the patients nor motor functions.
20592948:78	Additionally, a pilot study was conducted with intrathecal delivery of IGF-1 (Nagano et al., ). Investigators claimed that the treatment was beneficial for the patients.
20592948:79	Two groups of patients were compared, receiving high or low doses of IGF-1 and it was observed that the motor functions decline was slowed down with the high dose of IGF-1 compared to the low dose.
20592948:80	However, as this study was not placebo-controlled, the results should be considered with caution.
20592948:81	Some years later, pre-clinical reports investigating the effects of IGF-1 in SOD-1 animals were published (Table ).
20592948:82	The majority of the reports argue in favor of a potential protective effect in ALS, with an increase in survival and motor function parameters (Kaspar et al., ; Dobrowolny et al., ; Nagano et al., ; Lepore et al., ; Dodge et al., ; Franz et al., ).
20592948:83	Also, IGF-1 mediates NMJ regeneration in a non-ALS related animal model (Apel et al., ), although some contradictory results are published (Grumbles et al., ). Nevertheless, two studies did not observe an improvement of survival in the SOD-1 transgenic model after IGF-1 treatment (Messi et al., ; Franz et al., ), and the work of Lepore et al. suggested that IGF-1 effect were only observed in male mice.
20592948:84	At the same time, a new clinical trial was initiated, with subcutaneous administration of IGF-1.
20592948:85	This clinical trial enrolled 330 patients and studied the effects of IGF-1 on muscular strength and survival (Sorenson et al., ). Unfortunately, IGF-1 treated patients did not improve relative to the control patients.
20592948:86	There may be explanations for the lack of success of this trial apart from the conclusion that IGF-1 is ineffective in ALS, especially since clinical observations show that the distribution of IGF-1 is increased at the spinal level of ALS patients (Wilczak et al., ; Corbo et al., ).
20592948:87	One point of critique against the pre-clinical work is that no subcutaneous administration of IGF-1 was performed, indeed, only genetic therapies (Kaspar et al., ; Lepore et al., ; Dodge et al., ; Franz et al., ) or intrathecal administration (Nagano et al., ) were used to treat SOD-1 animals.
20592948:88	A genetic approach can not be translated into subcutaneous delivery in patients, due to the high and constant expression of IGF-1 over time and the intrathecal administration which directly delivers IGF-1 to the CNS in contrast to the subcutaneous injections studied in the large trials.
20592948:89	Also, treatment in the SOD-1 model ideally should be started at later time points during disease progression, and not before the disease onset.
20592948:90	Indeed, as Howe et al. observed, it is highly unlikely that meaningful levels of IGF-1 were reached in the CSF and CNS tissue with the dose of IGF-1 used in the latest clinical trial (Sorenson et al., ). 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
Discovered in the late 80’s as a growth factor for vascular endothelial cells, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis (Connolly et al., ). The first evidence for neurotrophic proprieties of VEGF arose in the early 2000’s, with studies on neuronal regeneration (Sondell et al., ; Hobson et al., ). VEGF was implicated as a growth factor possibly involved in ALS by the discovery that mice with deletion of the HIF-response element in the VEGF promoter developed an ALS-like phenotype (Oosthuyse et al., ). Subsequent genetic analyses however failed to produce clear evidence for an effect of VEGF polymorphisms on the risk of developing ALS in the human (Gros-Louis et al., ; Lambrechts et al., ; Van Vught et al., ; Chen et al., ; Fernandez-Santiago et al., ; Zhang et al., ).
20592948:91	However, apart from the genetic discussion, VEGF promotes survival of cells over expressing a mutated SOD1 G93A protein (Li et al., ; Lunn et al., ) and ameliorates effects of glutamate excitotoxicity (Tolosa et al., ; Bogaert et al., ). In rodents (Table ), VEGF treatment leads to a delay of disease onset, an improvement of motor functions, protection of motoneurons and neuromuscular junctions, and increase in survival (Azzouz et al., ; Storkebaum et al., ; Wang et al., ; Zheng et al., ; Hwang et al., ). 
These data are promising for a clinical investigation of VEGF in ALS.
20592948:92	Beside the pre-clinical evidence for a potential benefit of VEGF in the treatment of ALS, clinical observations did show that VEGF is down regulated in the late stage of ALS (Devos et al., ), and restoring its level therefore could bring benefit for the patients.
20592948:93	The potential of VEGF as a therapeutic agent is further strengthened by its ability to cross the BBB (Wang et al., ; Dobrogowska et al., ; Yang et al., ). There are no published clinical trials so far, but a clinical trial is ongoing in Belgium and is currently recruiting patients.
20592948:94	Clearly, angiogenic side effects of VEGF treatment will have to be monitored closely.
20592948:95	The Fibroblast Growth Factors 
The Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) proteins are growth factors with homologous structure that promote angiogenesis and the proliferation of fibroblasts.
20592948:96	Members of this family were tested for their effects on motoneurons.
20592948:97	It was demonstrated that FGF-1 and FGF-2 can protect motoneurons after axotomy-induced apoptosis, and that they support neuronal regeneration (Cuevas et al., ; Piehl et al., ; Klimaschewski et al., ) (Table ).
20592948:98	However, one recent report points out that, in ALS, FGF-1 might activate motoneuron apoptosis by astrocytes, thereby possibly contributing to ALS pathophysiology (Cassina et al., ). More work is needed to establish if the FGFs can be drug candidates for ALS.
20592948:99	Hepatocyte Growth Factor 
Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) was discovered in 1984 as a growth factor acting on the liver (Nakamura et al., ).
20592948:100	This growth factor exerts anti-apoptotic activity in the liver after endotoxin-induced hepatic failure (Kosai et al., ). Neuronal effects consist of activity in the guidance and survival of neurons in the developing nervous system (Ebens et al., ).
20592948:101	Moreover, HGF is protective on motoneurons in culture and in vivo after axotomy (Wong et al., ; Okura et al., ). In rodent models of ALS, HGF reduces motoneuron degeneration and increases survival (Sun et al., ; Ishigaki et al., ; Kadoyama et al., ) (Table ).
20592948:102	Hepatocyte Growth Factor appears to be a good candidate for the treatment of ALS, especially since HGF levels in ALS patients appear to be dysregulated (Tsuboi et al., ).
20592948:103	However, additional pre-clinical work is required.
20592948:104	Indeed, more insight at the level of the neuromuscular junctions is welcome since it seems that HGF can have an influence on the formation of the NMJs (Madhavan and Peng, ; Tatsumi et al., ) but appears to be inefficient on their regeneration unless used in conjunction with other growth factors (Grumbles et al., ).
20592948:105	It can be also of interest for the design of a clinical trial to investigate whether a systemic delivery of HGF can reproduce the promising results observed after intrathecal administration in rodents.
20592948:106	Bone Morphogenetic Proteins 
The Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are a family of growth factors influencing bone formation.
20592948:107	BMPs have potent actions in the nervous system (Ebendal et al., ). A recent report on a drosophila model of ALS suggests an implication of the BMP signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of the disease (Ratnaparkhi et al., ). Only one report on transgenic ALS models was published with one of the BMPs, BMP-7 (Dreibelbis et al., ). The protocol used to treat the mice was certainly ambitious with a single injection of BMP-7 which likely resulted in the negative outcome of this experiment (Table ).
20592948:108	BMPs appear as an interesting growth factor family for the treatment of ALS, however, much more work is needed to come to a judgement whether BMPS are clinical candidates for ALS.
20592948:109	Erythropoietin 
The first hematopoietic growth factor identified as a possible neuronal growth factor was Erythropoietin (EPO).
20592948:110	Research on its ability to counteract effects of hypoxia in general led to the discovery of the expression of EPO and its receptor in the central nervous system (Lewczuk et al., ; Siren et al., ; Ehrenreich et al., ). EPO is able to counteract apoptosis of neurons after hypoxia and ischemia.
20592948:111	It is also able to enhance regeneration of the NMJs in rats after crush injury (Toth et al., ). 
Recently, EPO was tested in SOD-1 transgenic animals (Table ).
20592948:112	Three studies were published in 2007 by three different groups.
20592948:113	All report a beneficial effect of EPO (Koh et al., ; Grignaschi et al., ; Grunfeld et al., ). Koh et al. describe protection of motoneurons against degeneration and an increase in survival of the SOD-1 animals after treatment.
20592948:114	In contrast, despite a delay on symptom progression, Grignaschi et al. and Grunfeld et al. did not observe an extension of survival.
20592948:115	Previous work on EPO in brain injury demonstrated that EPO is able to cross the BBB (Statler et al., ), making it a good candidate to target the CNS.
20592948:116	Especially carbamylated EPO (CEPO) might be a good candidate for ALS treatment, as it lacks hematopoietic effects of EPO while preserving neuroprotective properties (Leist et al., ; Mennini et al., ; Kirkeby et al., ).
20592948:117	However, more pre-clinical work is needed before concluding on the relevance of EPO for ALS.
20592948:118	Thrombopoietin 
Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a glycoprotein involved in the regulation of the thrombocytosis.
20592948:119	Recently the receptor for TPO has been detected in the central nervous system (Yang et al., ). In contrast to other hematopoietic factors with neuroprotective activity, TPO induces apoptosis in neurons and inhibits neuronal differentiation (Ehrenreich et al., ; Samoylenko et al., ). Despite those negative results, the effects of TPO were investigated in the SOD-1 transgenic mouse model.
20592948:120	TPO did not show any benefit in this model (Caraganis et al., ). 
Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor 
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein responsible for the generation of neutrophilic granulocytes.
20592948:121	G-CSF is currently used clinically in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
20592948:122	Recently, neuroprotective and regenerative properties in the brain and in the spinal cord have been described (Schneider et al., ). The G-CSF receptor is expressed in diverse areas of the CNS with a predominantly neuronal localization, including spinal motoneurons.
20592948:123	In rodent models for stroke, G-CSF displays anti-apoptotic properties.
20592948:124	In addition, G-CSF induces neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and is able to cross the brain blood barrier (Schneider et al., ). G-CSF enhances neurite outgrowth in vitro and preserves tract integrity in spinal cord injury (Pitzer et al., ).
20592948:125	It also enhances axonal regeneration and muscle reinnervation after axotomy in rodents (Pan et al., ). 
We investigated the effects of G-CSF on animal models of motoneuron diseases (Table ), including axotomized neonatal mice (Henriques et al., ) and SOD-1 transgenic animals (Pitzer et al., ). Subcutaneous delivery of G-CSF, as well as transgenic over expression, is able to slow down disease progression and increase survival of SOD1 mice by rescuing motoneurons.
20592948:126	Curiously, the potential of G-CSF in ALS was investigated in patients before our pre-clinical study was published (Table ).
20592948:127	Up to now, three clinical pilot studies were conducted with G-CSF in ALS patients showing that subcutaneous G-CSF treatment is reasonably tolerated in the doses given (Cashman et al., ; Zhang et al., ; Nefussy et al., ). Effects of G-CSF on disease progression can not be deduced from these studies since the size of patient cohorts was too small.
20592948:128	Nevertheless, in one trial, an interesting trend for slowing down disease progression was reported (Nefussy et al., ).
20592948:129	Similarly, Zhang et al. report on a delay in motor decline.
20592948:130	Another clinical trial used G-CSF indirectly by treating ALS patients with an autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells into the cerebrospinal fluid.
20592948:131	The conclusion of the investigators was that the treatment results in an improvement of the patients’ quality of life and a delay of disease progression (Martinez et al., ).
20592948:132	It is not clear whether the reported benefit might be caused by treatment with G-CSF or by the transplantation of stem cells, or both.
20592948:133	Due to its good tolerability (Morstyn et al., ; Nefussy et al., ), its capability to cross the BBB (Schneider et al., ; Zhao et al., ), a clinically translatable dose range, and the initial promising hints from the published clinical studies, G-CSF is a good candidate for a larger clinical trial in ALS.
20592948:134	General Reasons for Clinical Failures 
The demonstration of therapeutic effects of neurotrophic factors for various CNS disease conditions did raise great enthusiasm about their use as therapeutic agents in the 80’s and early 90’s.
20592948:135	Therefore, a number of clinical trials in neurodegenerative conditions in the peripheral and central nervous system have been conducted.
20592948:136	The fact that these early studies did not immediately bear striking success was likewise received with great disappointment.
20592948:137	Today we can better weigh the opportunities and pitfalls of growth factor treatment in the nervous system, and come to a balanced understanding why individual factors have failed, and why others may be successful.
20592948:138	The clinical failure of growth factors has to be viewed with great diligence, and is in no way ascribable to one single reason especially in ALS.
20592948:139	We have grouped the likely main causative factors below: 
Lessons Learned 
The need for a therapy is urgent.
20592948:140	However, urgency should not lead to rushed decisions for initiating clinical trials that will be negative because necessary key data were lacking.
20592948:141	Every negative trial in the field will lead to further frustration of physicians, patients, and funding agencies, and undermine the most powerful weapon we have, hope for finding a real therapeutic option for the patients.
20592948:142	On the pre-clinical side, we need a consensus of what are minimal requirements or an assessment strategy for a pre-clinical efficacy package.
20592948:143	In the field of stroke, this has been done by the so-called STAIR (Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable) criteria (Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable II (STAIR-II) ; Fisher, ; Fisher et al., , ; Saver et al., ). Attempts to do so have been initiated by the ALS TDI with the idea of a unified test battery (Scott et al., ).
20592948:144	However, it is also clear that without a precedence of successful translation of pre-clinical data to the patient (with the possible exception of Riluzole) it is very difficult to select strict cut-off criteria for pre-clinical efficacy, as these might pose a danger for unwillfully discarding exactly those drugs that would have worked in the human.
20592948:145	In the absence of proof for the predictiveness of all models used, we should use a combination of different animal models that monitor different aspects of ALS disease pathophysiology, e.g. two different SOD1-mutant models, possibly in mice and rats, and axotomy models.
20592948:146	Ideally, a dose-effect relationship should be established.
20592948:147	All tests have to be conducted in a rigorously blinded and randomized manner, and ideally be performed in at least two independent labs.
20592948:148	If novel animal models become available, they should be immediately tested for effects.
20592948:149	In addition, we have to have a very good understanding of how the drug in question works, and if it addresses several of the mechanisms likely relevant to ALS.
20592948:150	For example, growth factors should show some efficacy against cell death, both apoptotic and excitotoxic, demonstrated on motoneurons, other primary neurons and/or motoneuron lines.
20592948:151	Also, effects on the integrity of the NMJ should be ascertained.
20592948:152	Only VEGF is known to preserve the innervations of NMJs in ALS (Zheng et al., ). For other growth factors, even if there is no direct evidence in an ALS model so far, some of them may have a beneficial effect on the NMJs and their regeneration, such as G-CSF (Pan et al., ), IGF-1 (Apel et al., ) and EPO (Toth et al., ). The available mode of action and animal model data should then be reviewed by an expert panel with the aim to decide whether the evidence package as a whole is sufficient to initiate clinical development.
20592948:153	This appears advantageous to us in contrast to relying on single strict cut-off criteria, as each growth factor has a specific spectrum of activities that in each case will generate a blend of mode of actions and animal data that have to be appreciated on a case by case basis.
20592948:154	On the pharmacokinetic side, we have to be certain that the protein in question passes the BBB, and reaches motoneurons in sufficient concentration, and over a reasonable time period.
20592948:155	The delivery route and formulation need to be fitted to that purpose.
20592948:156	Measurements of the protein levels in the CSF should be performed within the trial.
20592948:157	Indeed, drug delivery to the CNS appears to be the most crucial problem to address, because pharmacokinetic problems otherwise preclude to reach a concise conclusion of whether a specific growth factor is indeed without effect in ALS trials.
20592948:158	This appears to be the case with all growth factors that have been tested in larger clinical trials (BDNF, CNTF, IGF-1).
20592948:159	Novel delivery tools and application forms should also be explored, such as gene therapy with a viral injection or cellular transplants (for review, see Hedlund et al., ; Bjorklund and Kordower, ). Those approaches have made progress in terms of safety and efficacy at pre-clinical level (Vercelli et al., ; Hester et al., ; Kim et al., ), and indeed clinical trials with cellular therapies have been recently conducted in ALS patients with no major safety concerns (Deda et al., ; Mazzini et al., ). Likewise, viral delivery has been explored in patients with Parkinon's disease (Kaplitt et al., ). These approaches are promising, but remain much more complicated in terms of safety than using pure proteins.
20592948:160	The side effects of the delivered growth factors have to be well characterized prior to gene therapy, with special regard to long term CNS delivery.
20592948:161	One principal disadvantage of many of those delivery systems is that it is difficult to stop delivery should any serious safety problems emerge.
20592948:162	One potentially attractive but also difficult delivery method, intrathecal delivery, should be further improved as a application route that would largely eliminate peripheral adverse effects.
20592948:163	Finally, in clinical trials we should continue to try and identify meaningful surrogate parameters that would allow a rational dose-finding strategy with relatively small patient numbers (e.g. EMG, MR tensor imaging, biomarkers).
20592948:164	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in sporadic ALS should be intensified to allow genome-based subgroup analyses in trials (Dunckley et al., ; Schymick et al., ; Valdmanis et al., ).
20592948:165	Finally, innovative trial designs that may allow to judge early on whether a drug likely has no efficacy (futility designs), or smaller trials against cleverly controlled database controls need to be further explored (Bryan et al., ; Moore and Miller, ; Palesch and Tilley, ; Shefner et al., ; Cheung et al., ; Czaplinski et al., ; Gordon et al., ; Schoenfeld and Cudkowicz, ; Gordon, ; Simmons, ; Aggarwal et al., ). 
Why are Growth Factors Still the Most Rational Approach to ALS?
20592948:166	The largest consensus on ALS is that its origin(s) remain(s) unknown despite tremendous work since decades.
20592948:167	As long as the precise etiopathology(-ies) of the disease is not be known, no specific and fully rational therapy can be designed to treat ALS.
20592948:168	However, in ALS, disease progression is due to the disruption of the motor unit, whatever the triggering factor(s) may be.
20592948:169	As long as we do not have more insights into the disease pathway(s), the most rational strategy remains to rescue and to strengthen the motor units as a whole, from the neuromuscular junctions up to the motoneuron cell body.
20592948:170	In that respect, neurotrophic growth factors are the best tool we have.
20592948:171	As detailed before, almost all growth factors are able to rescue the motoneuron cell bodies in the spinal cord once they reach the CNS.
20592948:172	Despite the considerable number of clinical trials undertaken with growth factors in ALS, it appears in retrospect that the hypothesis of growth factors for the treatment of ALS has never really been put to test in the human system, as all trials were inadequate in dosing and/or application of the protein in question.
20592948:173	There are growth factors with excellent rationale on the shelf, that should be evaluated further with stringent criteria.
20592948:174	One particularly interesting group are the hematopoietic growth factors EPO and G-CSF: These appear to have many of the above discussed properties of nervous growth factors, but may be advantageous with regard to the above identified problematic issues.
20592948:175	In particular, they have an excellent history of safety, a well-known pharmacokinetic profile, pass the blood-brain barrier, and the doses efficacious in animal models can be easily translated into the clinic.

19756725:0	Introduction 
Understanding the effects of near weightlessness on the functioning of cells is important for manned space exploration.
19756725:1	But above all, questions about the mechanisms of gravity sensing by cells are fundamental for understanding the evolution of terrestrial life and address the mechanism of mechanosensory responses and cell polarity development in organisms.
19756725:2	The microtubule cytoskeleton and cell wall play key roles in plant cell growth and division, together determining the final shape of plant cells and therefore the performance of (crop) plants.
19756725:3	The relationship between cortical microtubules and cellulose microfibrils, which lie at the opposite sides of the plasma membrane and mechanically determine the elongation axis, is a long-standing question of plant cell growth (Emons et al. ; Baskin ; Lloyd and Chan ).
19756725:4	In growing interphase cells, the cortical microtubules are ordered predominantly transverse to the cell’s elongation axis.
19756725:5	Cellulose synthases (CESA) in etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells move bidirectionally in the plasma membrane along tracks that are typically defined by cortical microtubules (Paredez et al. ; Emons et al. ; Gutierrez et al. ).
19756725:6	However, examples are known in which, vice versa, cellulose microfibrils impose orientation on newly formed cortical microtubules (Fisher and Cyr ; Roberts et al. ; Paredez et al. ).
19756725:7	The idea for studying these two structural arrays under near weightlessness conditions came from the following observations.
19756725:8	In vitro, tubulin self-organizes into parallel microtubule bands, but in near weightlessness (free fall phase of sounding rocket), clinostat-treated and magnetic levitated material (simulated near weightlessness) this pattern is not formed (Papaseit et al. ; Tabony et al. ; Portet et al. ; Glade et al. ; Tabony ).
19756725:9	In line with these results, it has been reported that in cultured mammalian cells microtubules show altered organizations under real or simulated near weightlessness (experiments on a sounding rocket, parabolic flights, spacecrafts, clinostat, and random positioning machine) (Lewis et al. ; Vassy et al. ; Lewis ; Meloni et al. ; Rösner et al. ). Also recovering Brassica napus protoplasts (wall-less single plant cells) are affected by real or simulated near weightlessness (experiments on a free-fall machine and on 2D and 3D-clinostats).
19756725:10	The microtubule density is temporarily reduced and after 3 days under these conditions, 50% fewer cells have parallel organized cortical microtubules (Skagen and Iversen ).
19756725:11	The mitotic index of the recovering protoplasts on the 2D-clinostat was reduced by more than half (Skagen and Iversen ).
19756725:12	Furthermore, space experiments with B.
19756725:13	napus protoplasts (Skagen and Iversen ) and 2D-clinostat experiments with B.
19756725:14	oleracea protoplasts (Nedukha ) resulted in reduced cellulose content of the recovering cell wall.
19756725:15	Iversen and coworkers conclude that “a unidirectional gravity force is a necessity for the reorganization of cortical microtubules in protoplasts from random to parallel arrays and that cortical microtubules act as responding elements that are able to sense different levels of gravity” (Skagen and Iversen ).
19756725:16	On the other hand, whole plants do not show significant changes in growth, flower production, cellulose microfibril ordering, protoxylem and metaxylem vessel element morphology or lignin content when grown in space (Halstead and Dutcher ; Musgrave et al. ; Levine et al. ). Nevertheless, cytological and chemical work indicates there are differences in cell wall texture, thickness, extensibility, and composition and levels of various polysaccharides (Nedukha ; Kwon et al. ; Soga et al. ; Hoson et al. ; de Micco et al. ). Some of these differences may be due to the lack of convection in plant growth chambers in space, which reduces heat distribution and gas exchange (Musgrave et al. ) or other not compensated for effects, such as radiation.
19756725:17	Cell elongation can only be optimal with a fully functional microtubule cytoskeleton.
19756725:18	Therefore, we investigated walled, single plant cells growing in an agarose matrix that were exposed to near weightlessness.
19756725:19	By using single-walled cells we were able to investigate whether the absence of microtubule ordering should be sought in the cell’s behavior in a tissue or in the effect of ordered wall elements and/or their production machinery, e.g., the cellulose synthase complexes.
19756725:20	We chose tobacco BY-2 suspension culture cells because the cells in this well-defined system posses robust viability, alternatively grow and divide without interference of differentiation processes, have large cell surfaces to be analyzed for cortical microtubules, and have been used for many plant cell biological studies, especially on the involvement of microtubules in cell elongation and cell division (Nagata et al. ; Vos et al. ).
19756725:21	The objectives of this study were to determine whether plant cells that are not in a tissue but do have a cell wall elongate and divide as under 1 g conditions when cultured for up to 8 days during our TUBUL space flight experiment and to ascertain whether the organization of the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton and the texture of cellulose microfibril wall are maintained at near weightlessness.
19756725:22	All imaging and measurements were performed on fixed material since live cell imaging is not yet possible at the ISS.
19756725:23	Because we did not find any obvious aberrations in the above characteristics in tobacco BY-2 suspension-culture cells at near weightlessness, we conclude that an organized tissue is not required for cell growth, division, and microtubule and cellulose microfibril organization in space.
19756725:24	Possibly, elements of the cell wall, or its production machinery, are involved in organizing the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton.
19756725:25	Materials and methods 
Results 
For the TUBUL experiments performed during the Dutch DELTA mission in April 2004 and the 12S mission in March–April 2006, both on board the Soyuz capsule and the International Space Station, we developed a method to culture and chemically fix plant suspension-cultured cells (Sieberer et al. ). Tobacco BY-2 cells were immobilized in thin agarose matrices that were reinforced with nylon mesh inside the culture chambers of the fully automated experiment cassettes (Plunger Box Units, PBUs) (Willemsen and Langerak ).
19756725:26	The PBUs allowed for liquid medium refreshment, passive oxygen supply via a gas-permeable membrane, chemical fixation, and a post-fixative wash.
19756725:27	Under laboratory conditions, the growth rate of cells in the PBUs was the same as in the agarose matrix covered with a gas permeable cellulose foil in Petri dishes, but delayed and slower than in liquid medium, probably due to the differences in nutrient and oxygen diffusion (Sieberer et al. ). Controls for the near weightlessness (μ g ) experiments were not only carried out in the laboratory in Wageningen (referred hereafter as the 1 g ground control), but also in a 1 g centrifuge inside the same KUBIK incubator as the samples exposed to near weightlessness (referred to as the on-board 1 g control).
19756725:28	This ensured that observed differences could be attributed to gravity rather than to radiation, vibrations, or other circumstances associated with the flight conditions.
19756725:29	Cells were chemically preserved at 6, 12, 132 (5.5 days), and 193 h (8 days) after launch.
19756725:30	Due to space limitations only one sample time point (193 h) was available for the on-board 1 g control.
19756725:31	Technically, the experiment was 100% successful; no leakage or other technical failure of the experiment hardware occurred and all experimental steps were executed nominally.
19756725:32	From a biological point of view, we had one loss; for unknown reasons in one out of four culture compartments of the flight experiment fixed at 132 h after launch the cells had not grown.
19756725:33	Due to technical problems after the Dutch DELTA mission (Sieberer et al. ), we only report results of the TUBUL2 experiment during the 12S mission.
19756725:34	Discussion 
As microtubule organization, both in vitro (Tabony et al. ) and in regenerating protoplasts (Skagen and Iversen ) were shown to be hampered at reduced gravity, we set out to investigate the influence of gravity on microtubule organization, cell wall texture, cell elongation, and cell shape, in single, walled plant cells.
19756725:35	We found that at near weightlessness during an 8-day space experiment, tobacco BY-2 suspension culture cells divided and grew as the control cells in the on-board 1 g centrifuge and the 1 g ground setup.
19756725:36	Their interphase cytoarchitecture and their cortical microtubule and cellulose microfibril ordering were also indistinguishable.
19756725:37	Not only did near weightlessness not alter these characteristics, the whole environment, including radiation and vibrations, also did not affect the processes that are crucial for plant cell growth and proliferation.
19756725:38	These are important and positive results if, in the future, plants have to be propagated from (frozen) cell culture stocks during long-term space missions.
19756725:39	In general, our results agree with several studies using whole plants (Halstead and Dutcher ; Musgrave et al. ; Levine et al. ), but contrast with the findings of Sato and coworkers (1999), who reported, based on electron microscopic observations, that Nicotiana tabacum stem explants grown in space had reduced microtubule quantities.
19756725:40	We conclude that plant cells do not need to be organized in a tissue to grow, divide and organize their microtubules and cellulose microfibrils in space.
19756725:41	Gravity is a mechanical force acting on Earth in one direction, which we counter in free-fall experiments.
19756725:42	Although weak, this force has been shown to influence cells that are not specialized in gravisensing (Lewis ; Loesberg et al. ).
19756725:43	The first change in a gravitational biological experiment is a mechanical change; all other changes depend on it and are subsequent (van Loon ).
19756725:44	Physics models show that for a mechanical effect, the sedimentation of the gravity-sensing element must outweigh diffusion and Brownian motion (Portet et al. ). Microtubules can function as these sedimenting mechano-sensing elements (Tabony et al. ).
19756725:45	However, unlike the direct link between gravity and microtubule ordering in polymerization experiments in vitro, there does not seem to be a correlation between the direction of gravity and the direction of cell elongation in the agarose-embedded non-differentiating tobacco BY-2 cell clusters (Fig.  a, b).
19756725:46	The combined results of the protoplast experiments by Skagen and Iversen and our suspension cell experiments may point to a mechanism in which the cell wall offers signals, or mechanical or spatial cues that facilitate cortical microtubule orientation as has been proposed before (Emons et al. ; Fisher and Cyr ; Baskin ; Paredez et al. ; Chu et al. ; Paredez et al. ). Protoplasts have no walls and do not experience the influence of cell shape (Cosentino Lagomarsino et al. ; Terenna et al. ), mechanical stress (Hamant et al. ) or cell wall texture (Fisher and Cyr ).
19756725:47	Cyr and coworkers (therefore) proposed that biophysical anisotropic strain of the cell wall is essential for setting up microtubule ordering and cell elongation (Wymer et al. ; Fisher and Cyr ).
19756725:48	So, only when the cell wall is absent, does gravity become influential to align the cortical microtubules (Skagen and Iversen ).
19756725:49	This notion is underpinned by the effect of weightlessness on the microtubule cytoskeleton in animal cells (Lewis et al. ; Vassy et al. ; Lewis ; Meloni et al. ; Rösner et al. ).
19756725:50	Our preliminary results using a random positioning machine also indicate that microtubule ordering and cell elongation are initially delayed in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts (Oudenhoven et al. unpublished results).
19756725:51	The bidirectional flow of information between the cell wall and microtubule array could be accomplished by the cellulose microfibrils proper or the cellulose synthase complexes, that partly travel in the same pseudo 2D space along the plasma membrane as the microtubules, since deletion of CESA2 or mutation of CESA6 both cause disordered microtubule arrays (Chu et al. ; Paredez et al. ).
19756725:52	It is generally believed that cell elongation needs parallel aligned cellulose microfibrils transverse to the elongation direction, which, at its turn, needs parallel aligned microtubules.
19756725:53	Microtubules could be aligned by cues from an anisodiametric cell shape, anisotropical mechanical stress, moving cellulose synthase complexes, a pre-existing cell wall pattern, or maybe gravity.
19756725:54	So, in combination with the use of protoplasts, mutants, and microtubule and cellulose microfibril inhibitors, near weightlessness is an experimental tool to further investigate the orientation mechanism of these two polymers at both sides of the plasma membrane.
19756725:55	The question currently under investigation in our laboratory is if recovering protoplasts (i.e., cells without pre-existing wall) at simulated near weightlessness can order their cellulose microfibrils in the absence of microtubules, and vice versa, if recovering protoplasts can order their microtubules in the absence of cellulose microfibril production.
19756725:56	Space flight experiments are technically and logistically demanding (and very expensive).
19756725:57	Fortunately, it is possible to approximate this type of biological experiments on a random positioning machine in which a state of functional near weightlessness may be simulated by constantly and randomly changing the direction of the gravity vector (Hoson et al. ; Kraft et al. ; van Loon ).
19756725:58	Such experiments also have the advantage that short-term studies can be done and gravity sensing can be studied separately from the cell’s adaptation to gravity.
19219611:0	Introduction 
Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies with approximately 357,000 new cases (273,858 males and 82,699 females) worldwide in 2002 . More than 90% of the bladder cancers are urothelial cell carcinomas (UCC)  and the majority (75–85%) presents initially as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) .
19219611:1	Of these patients, about 70% presents with papillary lesions that are non-invasive and limited to the mucosa (Ta), 20% with lesions that invade the subepithelial connective tissue (T1) and 10% with carcinoma in situ (CIS).
19219611:2	Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), followed by adjuvant intravesical instillations with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy are considered standard treatment for NMIBC.
19219611:3	In general, the probabilities of recurrence and progression in NMIBC at 5 years range from 31 to 78% and from less than 1–45% depending on grade and stage, respectively . These rates illustrate the modest success of currently available treatments and underline the need for improved adjuvant treatment.
19219611:4	Although in vitro models are useful for initial development and evaluation of therapeutic agents and modalities, adequate animal models are still essential in the preclinical development of new effective and safe therapies for many human malignancies.
19219611:5	It allows the investigation of aspects that cannot be studied under clinical conditions such as pharmacokinetics and toxicity.
19219611:6	For bladder cancer in particular, much effort has been devoted to the development of an appropriate tumor model for the evaluation of new chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents, drug regiments, or other anti-tumor modalities.
19219611:7	The ideal animal bladder tumor model that resembles human disease both histologically and in behavior should include the following characteristics : 
In this topic paper, we discuss existing in vivo rat bladder tumor models with their specific shortcomings.
19219611:8	In the second part of the paper, we describe the development of a potential new orthotopic rat bladder tumor model.
19219611:9	Existing in vivo models 
Rats and mice are the most common species used for in vivo UCC models.
19219611:10	Rodents have a lower urinary tract comparable to humans and neoplasms in the bladder are morphologically very alike . Bladder tumors in rodents can be established subcutaneously (heterotopically) or in the bladder (orthotopically) either by transplantation of tumor cells or by chemical induction.
19219611:11	Although murine orthotopic models are available [e.g. , ], these models are limited by the size of the animal, with a small urethral caliber, thin bladder wall and small bladder capacity as a consequence.
19219611:12	Catheterization of mice to introduce tumor cells, intravesical therapeutics or for example an ultrathin cystoscope is more difficult than in rats.
19219611:13	A rat bladder is approximately 10 times larger than the bladder of a mouse and the better developed muscular layer allows better histological assessment of depth of invasion and decreases the risk of perforation during bladder catheterization . Therefore, in important aspects the rat model offers significant advantages over the murine model and in this topic paper only the rat model is further discussed.
19219611:14	Potential new orthotopic ACI rat bladder tumor (RBT323) model 
In the search for the ideal animal bladder cancer model, we are currently developing a new orthotopic ACI rat bladder tumor (RBT323) model.
19219611:15	The RBT323 tumor is a non-carcinogen-induced tumor and arose spontaneously in an ACI rat.
19219611:16	In the past, this RBT323 tumor was used as a subcutaneous rat bladder tumor model in our laboratory . Histologically, the RBT323 tumor is a grade 2–3 pure urothelial cell tumor with no squamous cells and the RBT323 cell line closely resembles human non-muscle invasive UCC both phenotypically and cytogenetically . 
The rather short treatment window of the frequently used syngeneic orthotopic AY-27/Fischer F344 rat bladder tumor model hampers its use in the evaluation of new treatments for NMIBC .
19219611:17	Moreover, it was recently shown that carcinogen-induced rodent bladder tumors have gene expression profiles more similar to those of human invasive than non-invasive tumors and thus would be a better experimental model for the former . For these reasons, we anticipated an orthotopic RBT323 tumor in the ACI rat to be an appropriate syngeneic model to study the anti-tumor effects of possible new treatments.
19219611:18	To accomplish this, a RBT323 rat bladder UCC cell line was established and transplanted orthotopically into syngeneic female ACI/SeqHSD rats (Harlan Spraque Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.).
19219611:19	RBT323 UCC cells were grown in monolayer cell culture and instilled into preconditioned (mild acid washing) rat bladders as single cell suspensions.
19219611:20	Tumor growth was assessed by ultrathin cystoscopy (0,5 mm diameter) and 24 days after instillation of tumor cells all rats were sacrificed and subjected to necropsy.
19219611:21	Cystectomy was performed for histopathological examination.
19219611:22	Overall in three out of the four rats tumor was established.
19219611:23	All tumors were non-muscle invasive (T1a–T1c) except one T2a tumor (2002 TNM staging system).
19219611:24	No metastases were found.
19219611:25	Unfortunately, all tumors were covered with normal urothelium (Fig.  ).
19219611:26	Still, initial results of this new orthotopic rat bladder tumor model are promising, because after 24 days most of the tumors seem to be non-muscle invasive with a reasonably long time window for the administration of study drugs, as a consequence.
19219611:27	Further studies are now being performed to look for the reproducibility and longitudinal behavior of the model.
19219611:28	Additionally, a study is performed without bladder preconditioning, but with optimized other transplantation conditions, trying to establish Ta tumors.
19219611:29	Conclusion 
To enable efficacy testing of new potential chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents, an orthotopic syngeneic non-muscle invasive UCC rat bladder tumor model would be ideal.
19219611:30	However, especially tumor cell implantation methods and diagnostic procedures for the early detection of tumor growth, and follow-up monitoring still need to be refined.
18682436:0	Introduction 
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is the acute localized adaptive process whereby blood flow is directed away from poorly ventilated areas of the lung in order to maximize ventilation–perfusion matching.
18682436:1	In isolated pulmonary arteries, HPV is typically biphasic, characterized by a large but transient first phase and a sustained and often gradually developing second phase.
18682436:2	The first phase is associated with a sizeable transient elevation in intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+] i), whereas during the second phase, there is a relatively small and rapidly stabilizing increase in [Ca 2+] i, the effect of which is greatly enhanced by a Rho-kinase- dependent Ca 2+ sensitization pathway.
18682436:3	src -family kinases ( src FKs) are a group of closely related non-receptor tyrosine kinases, of which three ( src fyn and yes ) are highly expressed in pulmonary artery.
18682436:4	Although tyrosine kinases are essential components of cell growth and proliferation signalling, they have also been implicated in vascular smooth muscle contraction.
18682436:5	We have recently shown in rat pulmonary artery, as have others in porcine coronary artery, that agonist-induced Rho-kinase-mediated Ca 2+ sensitization and force generation is dependent on src FKs.
18682436:6	,
Ca 2+ sensitization of the contractile apparatus occurs through inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP), leading to increased phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light-chain (MLC 20), independently of changes in [Ca 2+] i.
18682436:7	MLCP inhibition occurs through phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit MYPT-1 via Rho-kinase.
18682436:8	We have shown that the second phase of HPV is selectively inhibited by the Rho-kinase blocker Y27632 but not by the PKC blocker Ro31-8220.
18682436:9	In addition, hypoxia enhances phosphorylation of MYPT-1 and MLC 20 in cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs).
18682436:10	Rho-kinase- mediated Ca 2+ sensitization is also a key factor in the pathogenesis of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.
18682436:11	,
Two studies using broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase blockers (genistein and tyrphostin) have suggested the involvement of tyrosine kinases in HPV.
18682436:12	src and fyn are both activated by hypoxia in cardiac myocytes, and src plays a crucial role in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) induction in vascular smooth muscle cells.
18682436:13	However, a specific role of src FKs in HPV and the contractile pathways affected remains to be determined.
18682436:14	In the present study, therefore, we evaluated the role of src FKs in HPV of rat small distal pulmonary arteries and determined how this relates to the hypoxia-mediated Rho-kinase-dependent Ca 2+ sensitization and [Ca 2+] i responses.
18682436:15	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
This study provides the first direct evidence for a role or roles of src FKs in HPV and firm supportive evidence for the importance of Ca 2+ sensitization in the sustained phase of the contraction.
18682436:16	Our observations also forge a clear link between the actions of Y27632 on hypoxic force generation and on hypoxia-mediated enhancement of Rho-kinase-dependent MYPT-1 and MLC 20 phosphorylation.
18682436:17	Our findings that hypoxia both activates src FK and enhances PP2-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein targets, coupled with the inhibition of HPV by both SU6656 and PP2, are suggestive of an active role of these kinases in HPV.
18682436:18	Hypoxia has been previously shown to activate src and the closely related kinase fyn in cardiac myocytes, and to enhance src FK- specific tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion kinases p125 FAK and paxillin.
18682436:19	p125 FAK may be the ∼120 kDa protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced by hypoxia and inhibited by PP2 in the present study.
18682436:20	HPV is believed to involve a change in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria.
18682436:21	Many protein kinases, including src FK, are activated by ROS, indeed src appears to play an essential role in many of the intracellular pathways activated by hypoxia and ROS in the systemic vasculature.
18682436:22	Exactly how src FK activity may be induced by ROS, assuming ROS production is enhanced during hypoxia in IPAs, remains to be determined.
18682436:23	The time course of the phosphorylation responses to hypoxia was complex.
18682436:24	In the absence of PGF 2α, hypoxia caused a multi-phasic phosphorylation response ending in sustained enhancement at the maximum time point of 30 min.
18682436:25	The initial drop at 1 min was large enough to become significant with regards to MLC 20 at ser-19.
18682436:26	A similar drop (although not significant) was also apparent with MLC 20 in the presence of PGF 2α, and indeed, in isolated IPAs, we sometimes observe a small very transient relaxation immediately after inducing hypoxia that precedes the first-phase contraction (unpublished observations).
18682436:27	The causes of these fluctuations are unknown.
18682436:28	In the presence of PGF 2α, hypoxia caused a large sustained increase in MYPT-1 phosphorylation.
18682436:29	This, however, was not exactly mirrored by MLC 20 phosphorylation, the time course of which resembled the time course of contraction, with a distinct transient first phase at 5 min followed by a sustained phase of up to 30 min.
18682436:30	This is not surprising since the first phase of HPV is clearly associated with a large transient increase in [Ca 2+] i, whereas the sustained phase of HPV is primarily associated with a Ca 2+ sensitization pathway, as shown previously.
18682436:31	,,
Prostanoids cause vascular smooth muscle contraction in part via Rho-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT-1.
18682436:32	In addition, we have recently demonstrated a direct involvement of src FK in PGF 2α-mediated Ca 2+ sensitization and contraction in rat IPAs, in which we showed that src FKs were activated by PGF 2α and provided evidence that src FKs were upstream mediators of Rho-kinase translocation, and phosphorylation of MYPT-1 and MLC 20.
18682436:33	Similarly, in this study, Rho-kinase-mediated MYPT-1 phosphorylation was inhibited by SU6656, and hypoxia-induced translocation of Rho-kinase in PASMCs was completely prevented by siRNA knockdown of src and strongly inhibited by knockdown of fyn . Therefore, src FKs are clearly involved in the upstream regulation of hypoxia-mediated Rho-kinase activity.
18682436:34	Since both hypoxia and PGF 2α activate src FKs and enhance MYPT-1 and MLC 20 phosphorylation, we confirmed that the action of hypoxia on this phosphorylation or of src FK blockers on HPV was independent of any action on the underlying pre-constriction.
18682436:35	Hypoxia caused enhancement of Rho-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT-1 in the absence as well in the presence of PGF 2α, and this enhancement was sensitive to an inhibitor of src FKs ( Figure  B ).
18682436:36	However, the relative effectiveness of hypoxia in the presence of PGF 2α at enhancing phosphorylation (MYPT-1 at 30 min: 94%; and MLC 20 at 30 min: 70%) was apparently greater than the sum of the individual effects of hypoxia alone and PGF 2α alone (MYPT-1 at 30 min: 28 + 29 = 57%; and MLC 20 at 30 min: 21 + 25 = 46%), suggesting a synergistic action of the two stimuli.
18682436:37	This is mirrored by force generation, where hypoxia in the absence of pre-constriction produced very small contractions of only 3–4% the size of that caused by 80 mM K +PSS, and yet in the presence of 5 µM PGF 2α which produces contractions of 10–15% of K +PSS, hypoxia caused additional sustained contractions of up to 30% of K +PSS.
18682436:38	Thus, stimulation of src FKs by both PGF 2α and hypoxia may explain at least part of the enhancement of HPV seen in the presence of this agonist.
18682436:39	In addition to an involvement in Ca 2+ sensitization, we have also found that the src FK inhibitor PP2 blocks the hypoxia-mediated [Ca 2+] i response in IPAs.
18682436:40	It is well established that the net phosphorylation status of MLC 20 at ser-19 involves a balance between Ca 2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation by MLCK and constitutive de-phosphorylation by MLCP.
18682436:41	Concomitant phosphorylation of MYPT-1 by Rho-kinase together with even a small elevation of [Ca 2+] i will, therefore, greatly enhance the phosphorylation of MLC 20.
18682436:42	Inhibition of either MYPT-1 phosphorylation or [Ca 2+] i-mediated MLCK activation, or both will thus inhibit force generation.
18682436:43	In addition to triggering Rho-kinase-mediated Ca 2+ sensitization, both hypoxia and PGF 2α cause an elevation of [Ca 2+] i, which in both cases is comprised of transient and sustained components.
18682436:44	,– In our hands, the transient component of the hypoxic [Ca 2+] i response is partly due to voltage-dependent Ca 2+ influx and partly due to capacitative Ca 2+-influx triggered by release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores, whereas the sustained component is probably due to influx through another as yet uncharacterized voltage-independent pathway.
18682436:45	Other studies propound the importance of influx through voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels.
18682436:46	In any case, src FKs have been implicated in both voltage-dependent and -independent mechanisms of Ca 2+ mobilization as triggered by either agonists or ROS.
18682436:47	,
In summary, our results suggest a direct role of src FKs in the acute contractile response to hypoxia in small pulmonary arteries of rat.
18682436:48	Since src FK inhibitors block both hypoxia-mediated Rho-kinase-dependent MYPT-1 phosphorylation and the hypoxic [Ca 2+] i response in IPAs, we may speculate that src FKs may act upstream of both key pathways to MLC 20 phosphorylation and contraction.
18682436:49	The specific phosphorylation targets of src FKs as activated by hypoxia, whether they be guanine exchange factors or guanine dissociation inhibitors leading to RhoA/Rho-kinase activation, or L-type Ca 2+ channels or phospholipase-Cγ, resulting in [Ca 2+] i mobilization, remain to be determined.

19856038:0	Experimental Methods 
The amount of experimental work on the mobilization of joints in animals is relatively small.
19856038:1	The amount of experimental work which has been done on human beings is, unfortunately, very large indeed.
19856038:2	In this paper it is particularly the knowledge which had been gained from experimental animal work which will be considered.
19856038:3	The discussion will be limited to the methods which have been used within the joint cavity.
19856038:4	It is realized that a joint may be made perfectly stiff by changes in and about the capsule, but in the great majority of cases, the most important changes are within the joint capsule, and have to do with the joint surfaces.
19856038:5	In other words, only the work bearing on the mobilization of ankylosed joints by the interposition method will be considered.
19856038:6	The experimental work will be reviewed under three divisions according to the character of the material interposed.
19856038:7	Clinical Methods 
The attempt to reestablish motion in a stiff joint in the human being has for a long time appealed to surgeons.
19856038:8	Many and diverse methods have been used.
19856038:9	No method has as yet given satisfactory results.
19856038:10	The means which have been used are briefly as follows: 
The attempt to reestablish motion in a stiff joint by forcible manipulation dates back to the earliest period of surgical treatment.
19856038:11	At the present time, this method is still in use.
19856038:12	There are few instances, however, in which success has followed its use, and the rule is that the joint progresses to complete ankylosis in spite of oft-repeated manipulation treatment.
19856038:13	The production of a pseudarthrosis in the region of an ankylosed joint was probably the first open operative attempt to reestablish function in a stiff hip.
19856038:14	In 1826, at the Pennsylvania Hospital, Ehea Barton divided the neck of the femur in a case of hip joint ankylosis and corrected a deformity.
19856038:15	The operation was followed by non-union, and the patient lived for six years and had a good weight-bearing leg with some motion in all directions at the hip joint.
19856038:16	This operation was performed again in 1830 by Rogers of New York with even more satisfactory results.
19856038:17	Berard, Esmarch, Rizzoli, Verneuil, and McIlhenney devised similar operative methods for the treatment of ankylosis of the temporo-maxillary joint.
19856038:18	Richet also used this operative method in the treatment of various ankylosed joints.
19856038:19	He advised the covering of the ends of the divided bone by flaps of periosteum to prevent subsequent union.
19856038:20	For obvious reasons this method of treatment is not to be recommended even if a pseudarthrosis could always be produced.
19856038:21	The actual resection of the ankylosed joint, with the idea of obtaining a flexible fibrous joint, has been used in the treatment of ankylosis of the jaw, elbow, and hip, with good functional results in a certain proportion of cases.
19856038:22	It is worth while emphasizing that many so-called arthroplasties are in reality joint resections.
19856038:23	Simple arthrolysis, in which the ankylosis is broken up and the joint surfaces made smooth, followed by closure of the joint, has been extensively used in the treatment of ankylosis.
19856038:24	Wolff has reported nine cases operated on by this method and claims good results.
19856038:25	Von Eiselsberg reported two cases treated in this manner with one good result and one poor result.
19856038:26	As a rule, cases operated on by this method are unreported.
19856038:27	Kocher suggested in the operative treatment of ankylosis of the knee joint, that after arthrolysis the joint be put in a state of dislocation for short period, and subsequently the dislocation be reduced.
19856038:28	There is nothing in the literature which indicates success following such a procedure.
19856038:29	Lexer has excised the entire ankylosed joint and transplanted into its place the entire joint of another individual, the transplant being obtained from a recently amputated leg or from an individual soon after death.
19856038:30	Satisfactory results have not followed the use of this formidable procedure.
19856038:31	Arthrolysis followed by the interposition of various substances between the joint surfaces has come to be the most widely used method of treatment of ankylosis of joints.
19856038:32	This method has given the largest proportion of improved cases, and as operating surgeons appreciate more clearly the pathology of the process of joint ankylosis and the macroscopic and microscopic changes which occur in the tissues following the interposition of various substances in joints, the possibilities and limitations of the interposition method will become more clear and the results of the use of the method will improve.
19856038:33	Various kinds of substances have been used as interposition material.
19856038:34	Carnochan, of New York, in 1840, interposed bits of wood and cotton in the attempt to reestablish motion in an ankylosed jaw.
19856038:35	Orlow, Roser, Chlumsky, Hoffa and others have used various sorts of inorganic nonabsorbable material, such as plates of magnesium, silver, gold, celluloid, zinc, rubber, etc.
19856038:36	The results, however, of the use of non-absorbable inorganic material have been such that it has been almost completely discarded.
19856038:37	The material which is now used almost universally is either free or pedunculated transplants of living tissue or implants of an absorbable organic substance.
19856038:38	Verneuil in 1860 successfully used a piece of muscle and fascia as interposition material in the treatment of an ankylosed jaw.
19856038:39	Helferich in 1894 first brought this operation to general notice, and Richet, Nelaton and others soon applied similar methods in the treatment of ankylosis of other joints.
19856038:40	Murphy in 1904 increased the general interest in this country as to the possibilities of reëstablishment of motion in ankylosed joints by the interposition method by reporting good results in 12 cases operated on by him.
19856038:41	Murphy advocated the use of pedunculated transplants of fascia and fat.
19856038:42	In Europe, Payr has been the chief exponent of this method of treatment.
19856038:43	He has devised several very ingenious procedures.
19856038:44	He uses large pedunculated flaps of muscle, fat and fascia.
19856038:45	He, particularly, has emphasized the importance of removing a large amount of bone.
19856038:46	Following the demonstration by Kirschner that free transplants of fascia remained viable, many operators have used free pieces of fascia as interposition material.
19856038:47	Payr states that he did not get as good results after free transplantation of fascia as those which followed the use of the pedunculated transplants.
19856038:48	W. S. Baer was the first to use an absorbable animal membrane.
19856038:49	He states that the use of a pedunculated transplant of living tissue is often followed by a painful, unstable joint, and he has reported good results following the use of his animal membrane in various joints.
19856038:50	Baer’s animal membrane is obtained by the hardening of pieces of pig’s bladder in chromic acid and subsequent sterilization by boiling in kumol.
19856038:51	This substance is absorbed after a period of about 40 days.
19856038:52	It is a thin, relatively pliable substance which can be adjusted to fit in the joint cavity and separate the denuded joint surfaces.
19856038:53	Allison and Brooks have used as interposition material a specially prepared fascia.
19856038:54	It is a thin, pliable membrane which heals into the joint cavities with little local reaction, and which is absorbed at the end of a period of about 30 days.
19856038:55	They emphasize the non-irritating qualities of this animal membrane.
19856038:56	At the present time, we believe there is no longer question that the interposition method is the best method of treatment of joint ankylosis.
19856038:57	The kind of material interposed, the operative technic, and postoperative care are still matters for discussion.
19856038:58	The viewpoint of those advocating the use of living tissue is expressed by Neff in the following manner: 
“From even a superficial study of the theory of operation and of the various methods proposed to produce permanent and useful motion in ankylosed joints, two points are clear: The first is that a pad of connective tissue must be present between the bone ends before the bursa or new joint can be formed; and the second is that the simplest, quickest, and most direct way of accomplishing this must be the method of choice.
19856038:59	This being the case, there can be no doubt that the interposition of joint capsule or a flap of fascia, either pedunculated or free, constitutes the ideal operation of arthroplasty.”
19856038:60	Baer has stated that it is his belief that the success of the operation depends on the character of the membrane used.
19856038:61	He enumerates the following requirements: 
Our own beliefs as regards the character of the substance best suited for interposition material in arthroplasties agree with these requirements as stated by Baer, except we emphasize the fact that the substance used must have the least possible irritating properties.
19856038:62	The views of those advocating the use of living tissue and those advocating the use of an absorbable non-living substance as interposition material can be briefly stated as follows: 
The former interpose the living tissue between the ends of the bones with the expectation that a new joint cavity will develop as a result of certain degenerative changes within the interposed tissue, and the latter interpose an absorbable non-living substance between the joint surfaces, with the idea that it will preserve the cavity created in the operative procedure.
19856038:63	We believe there is little experimental or clinical evidence that anything approximating a normal joint cavity develops as a result of degenerative changes in living tissue interposed between joint surfaces.
19856038:64	The small cavities which form may serve to increase the range of motion following the use of living tissue as an interposition material in operations on the hip or the elbow, as the small cavities which form between the ends of the bones in an ununited fracture probably increase the range of false motion of the fragments; but we do not believe this method ever results in the formation of a joint cavity which permits of the sliding motion necessary to the normal function of a knee joint.
19856038:65	On the other hand, we believe that experimental work on animals has shown conclusively that union of approximated denuded joint surfaces may be permanently prevented by the interposition of a non-irritating absorbable animal membrane.
19856038:66	Time does not permit the consideration of the application of operative methods to individual cases, but, briefly, the operative method which has seemed best consists in separating of the ankylosis in a manner to produce joint surfaces which conform as nearly as possible to the original joint architecture, and placing the absorbable animal membrane so as to separate all opposed denuded joint surfaces.
19856038:67	In operations on the hip joint, the lateral curved transverse incision, followed by the temporary removal of the great trochanter, has seemed to be the best method of exposing the joint.
19856038:68	In operations on the knee joint the method of exposure which has seemed best consists in an anterior longitudinal incision, followed by a longitudinal splitting of the patella and tendons.
19856038:69	The ankylosis is then broken up and the joint surfaces are exposed by marked hyperflexion of the knee.
19856038:70	This method gives a good exposure and does not harm any of the vital holding structures of the joint.
19856038:71	The method described by Payr, of temporary removal of the tibial tubercle and reflection of the patella and tendon upward, gives a very excellent exposure.
19856038:72	It has been used in a few of our cases, but we have discontinued it for the reason that it seems desirable for the patient to begin active and passive motion of the joint as soon after operation as possible.
19856038:73	This is before the time we have felt safe in risking the union of the replaced tibial tubercle.
19856038:74	In operations on the knee joint the removal of a large amount of bone is not advisable, for the reason that subsequent instability may result.
19856038:75	A rigid knee joint is preferable to one with good motion and poor stability.
19856038:76	In operations on the elbow, the joint has been exposed by a posterior longitudinal incision through the triceps muscle and tendon.
19856038:77	As regards the post-operative care of the patients, it is to be emphasized that every patient must have very careful supervision for a long period of time.
19856038:78	After operation the patients should be encouraged to begin active motion of the joint as soon as the operation wound is healed.
19856038:79	In the case of the hip joint this is at the end of 4–6 weeks, but in all other joints active motion should be begun at the end of 10–14 days.
19856038:80	No joint should ever be moved actively or passively to the point of causing pain or inducing visible local inflammatory reaction.
19856038:81	Repeated baking and massage must be continued as long as there is any indication of increase in joint function.
19856038:82	In conclusion it is to be emphasized that the results of all known operative methods for the relief of joint ankylosis are at best most often unsatisfactory.
19856038:83	In general the hip, elbow and jaw results are fairly good.
19856038:84	The results of arthroplasties on the knee joint are the least satisfactory.
19856038:85	Every patient should, previous to operation, be clearly and frankly as possible told of the impossibility of restoration of complete normal joint function, and that the most he can hope for is improvement after a long and tedious treatment.
18958218:0	Introduction 
Top-down control from attentional orienting based on our changing expectations and task goals is recognized to have pervasive effects upon perceptual functions at many levels of stimulus analysis (Kastner and Pinsk, ; Luck and Hillyard, ; Nobre, ).
18958218:1	Intensive investigation across diverse methodologies has made significant headway in revealing the neural systems and cellular mechanisms of attentional modulation of perceptual representations (e.g., Luck et al., ; Mesulam, ; Moore, ; Reynolds and Chelazzi, ; Rushworth and Taylor, ; Serences and Yantis, ; Womelsdorf and Fries, ).
18958218:2	Extrapolating, it would be reasonable to conjecture that the effects of attentional orienting extend to the domain of memory.
18958218:3	Volitional control over long-term memory retrieval is implied by our ability to retrieve facts or episodes that are relevant to our current interest or task goal.
18958218:4	Likewise, it is intuitive to propose that attentional orienting can bias our access to the contents of short-term memory enabling us to focus upon particularly relevant objects or features from those currently maintained on-line.
18958218:5	Surprisingly, however, this form of flexibility is not an established feature of most memory models, and very little research has considered the existence or the mechanisms of top-down attentional control over memory representations.
18958218:6	Visual short-term memory (VSTM) provides a suitable entry point for the investigation of this basic and important issue.
18958218:7	Most views of VSTM emphasize its limitations and stability rather than its flexible control.
18958218:8	VSTM is highly limited in its capacity (Cowan, ; Davis and Holmes, ; Luck and Vogel, ; Wheeler and Treisman, ; Xu and Chun, ).
18958218:9	Its contents, to a large extent, are already the product of focused attention (Atkinson and Shiffrin, ; Schmidt et al., ), and are considered to remain stable during the maintenance period across saccadic eye movements or distraction (Irwin, ; Irwin and Andrews, ; Phillips, ).
18958218:10	Retrieval from VSTM is usually thought to proceed in an automatic and serial fashion (Sternberg, ).
18958218:11	However, a growing number of studies have recently begun to challenge this rigid view VSTM.
18958218:12	Studies using retrodictive cues (“retro-cues”) to orient attention to particular locations or objects within arrays held in VSTM have reported consistent performance benefits in change-detection and memory-search tasks (Griffin and Nobre, ; Landman et al., ; Lepsien and Nobre, ; Lepsien et al., ; Makovski and Jiang, ; Makovski et al., ; Matsukura et al., ; Nobre et al., ; Sligte et al., ). The mechanisms by which attentional orienting enhances VSTM functions are just beginning to be explored.
18958218:13	Work so far has ruled out possible uninteresting, artifactual explanations for the effects, such as: speed-accuracy trade-offs (Griffin and Nobre, ; Lepsien et al., ), response biases (Griffin and Nobre, ), eye movements (Griffin and Nobre, ; Matsukura et al., ), or articulation (Makovski and Jiang, ; Makovski et al., ; Matsukura et al., ). Several, more interesting, possibilities remain, which are not mutually exclusive.
18958218:14	To date, studies have investigated how attentional orienting may influence the maintenance of items in VSTM.
18958218:15	Some studies have suggested that attentional orienting may enhance the active maintenance of relevant items and/or suppress maintenance of irrelevant items (Lepsien and Nobre, ).
18958218:16	Other studies have suggested that attentional orienting may protect the maintenance of specific items from decay or proactive interference (Makovski and Jiang, ; Makovski et al., ; Matsukura et al., ; Sligte et al., ). 
The present study complements and extends this growing literature, by exploring the ability of spatial attentional orienting to optimize VSTM retrieval functions.
18958218:17	Specifically, we exploited the high temporal resolution and functional sensitivity of event-related potentials (ERPs) to test the ability of spatial orienting to optimize the retroactive search through VSTM for a target probe.
18958218:18	Spatial orienting was manipulated by providing spatially informative (spatial) or non-informative (neutral) retro-cues presented 1500–2500 ms after arrays containing different VSTM loads (1, 2 or 4 colored items) and before the target probe (similar to Lepsien et al., ). As is well established, in the absence of attentional orienting, response times (RTs) for searching for items within VSTM increases linearly with load (Sternberg, ).
18958218:19	Event-related potentials elicited by the probe stimulus in the neutral retro-cue trials also provided a direct neural correlate of retroactive search through VSTM.
18958218:20	We discovered a new ERP component, which we termed N3 RS, specifically linked to retroactive search through VSTM.
18958218:21	Both the amplitude and duration of the N3 RS increased monotonically with VSTM load.
18958218:22	If spatial orienting is able to optimize the search path through VSTM and prioritize retrieval of the item at the relevant location, the decrement of RT over VSTM load should be attenuated.
18958218:23	Furthermore, if spatial orienting provides an effective short-cut to the relevant item, its effects should become increasingly pronounced as VSTM load increases.
18958218:24	Attenuation of the N3 RS ERP component by spatial retro-cues would provide the strongest direct evidence for modulation of search-related neural activity, ruling out alternative explanations for the behavioral effects.
18958218:25	Finding that attentional orienting can change the search path through VSTM would pose a strong challenge to standard theories of VSTM.
18958218:26	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Data from the sixteen subjects with good behavioral performance and clean ERP data were used to characterize both the behavioral and ERP effects.
18958218:27	Behavioural and ERP results converged to demonstrate that spatial orienting optimized search for a target item within VSTM.
18958218:28	Discussion 
In this study, we used ERPs and behavioral measures to test the ability of spatial orienting to bias retrieval functions in VSTM.
18958218:29	In particular, we manipulated VSTM load to identify neural activity specifically related to searching retroactively for an item within VSTM and to test its modulation by spatially retrodictive retro-cues.
18958218:30	Our experimental approach was successful in identifying behavioral and ERP correlates of search-related activity, which varied systematically as a function of VSTM load.
18958218:31	Our results yielded clear evidence that spatial orienting can influence search in VSTM directly.
18958218:32	The behavioral pattern of results was consistent with previous studies showing increases in accuracy and decreases in response time when predictive retro-cues are used to orient attention to relevant locations of arrays maintained in VSTM (Griffin and Nobre, ; Landman et al., ; Makovski and Jiang, ; Makovski et al., ; Matsukura et al., ; Sligte et al., ). In particular, as in a previous study (Lepsien et al., ), spatial retro-cues attenuated the behavioral costs and diminished the RT slopes associated with retrieving probe items from progressively larger arrays (Sternberg, ), with more pronounced effects for probe-present compared to probe-absent trials.
18958218:33	Further analysis of the behavioral results showed that the effects of retro-cues became progressively accentuated as the load increased.
18958218:34	Increasing effects of retro-cues in the context of increasing competition between items in VSTM is consistent with top-down attentional biasing of selective aspects of the maintained VSTM representation, such that the information related to the relevant item is enhanced and/or competition from irrelevant items is diminished.
18958218:35	The pattern of results is consistent with that obtained in the previous fMRI study by Lepsien using a very similar task (Lepsien et al., ), but retro-cueing effects have not been found to increase significantly with load in other studies (Makovski et al., ; Matsukura et al., ). Makovski and colleagues found that the protective effects of retro-cues against proactive interference did not increase in magnitude beyond the case of load-1, in which attention is summoned automatically to the occupied location (though they do not analyze effects on response times, only on accuracy and sensitivity).
18958218:36	They used their findings to argue against attentional biasing effects of retro-cueing, and to support mechanisms that protect selective aspects of the VSTM representation against interference.
18958218:37	In the study by Matsukura and colleagues, the number of items cued by the hemifield retro-cues increased as the VSTM load increased, making it difficult to draw inferences from the null effect of load.
18958218:38	In the current experiment, the arrays were not subjected to proactive interference, and therefore it was not possible to test whether the increasing advantages for retro-cues in the context of larger VSTM loads would survive such a manipulation.
18958218:39	Additional experiments will be required to determine the boundary conditions for VSTM load to influence the effects of retro-cues.
18958218:40	Based on the current results, it is possible to conclude that retro-cues can trigger attentional biasing effects, at least in the absence of interfering stimulation.
18958218:41	The conclusions are consistent with the observation that maintenance-related neural activity in specialized posterior brain regions is modulated after retro-cues (Lepsien and Nobre, ).
18958218:42	Analysis of ERPs triggered by the probe stimuli in the present experiment further showed that orienting attention to locations within VSTM arrays has direct consequences for the retrieval functions.
18958218:43	By focusing our analysis on the topographies and amplitudes of the potentials triggered by probes present in VSTM arrays of different loads, we were able to identify a stage of neural processing associated with VSTM search and to chart its modulation by spatial orienting.
18958218:44	Starting around 300 ms, a fronto-centrally distributed negative potential was systematically related to the degree of retroactive search required to locate the probe within VSTM array (N3 RS).
18958218:45	The topographical segmentation showed the duration of this functional state to increase as VSTM load increased in neutral retro-cue trials.
18958218:46	In contrast, this functional state was completely absent when probes followed spatial retro-cues.
18958218:47	The amplitude analysis showed the N3 RS to be increasingly negative as load increased after neutral retro-cues, but found no significant modulation during this time period after spatial retro-cues.
18958218:48	The topographical differences during this period of neural processing suggest a difference in the kind of neural processing engaged by probes after neutral vs. spatial retro-cues.
18958218:49	Topographical differences indicate activation of different neural generators or, at least, the differential weighting of activation in a common set of neural structures.
18958218:50	The ERP findings are therefore compatible with spatial retro-cues enabling the direct retrieval of the item at the retrodicted location, and circumvention of VSTM search altogether.
18958218:51	However, they are also compatible with a significant attenuation of search-related activity by spatial retro-cues, so that the brain areas participating in VSTM search do not contribute much to the scalp topography relative to other areas engaged in other, temporally overlapping functions.
18958218:52	The small, but still significant, residual behavioral effects of VSTM load in spatial retro-cue conditions attest to some degree of load-varying search even when spatial retro-cues specified the relevant location with 100% certainty.
18958218:53	In order to settle whether spatial orienting modulates VSTM retrieval by circumventing vs. diminishing the amount of search, more behavioral testing will be informative.
18958218:54	Using larger numbers of spatial retro-cue trials, it may be possible to characterize the distribution of response times.
18958218:55	Bimodal distributions would suggest that participants may fail to use the spatial retro-cues on some trials.
18958218:56	If so, it will be interesting to test how spatial retro-cues influence responses around each mode of the distribution to determine whether it is possible to eliminate load costs completely when retro-cues are used effectively.
18958218:57	As far as we can tell, the N3 RS is one of the first descriptions of an ERP marker for search through VSTM representations (see also Gomarus et al., ). Further experiments capitalizing on this kind of approach should prove fruitful in investigating the neural mechanisms and dynamics of VSTM retrieval more generally, as well as of its modulation by attentional orienting.
18958218:58	At this stage, the modulation of the N3 RS by retro-cues clearly shows that the search path through VSTM is flexible and under voluntary control.
18958218:59	The findings are compatible with two types of mechanisms.
18958218:60	(1) Retro-cues could exert effects during the maintenance period, so that the nature of the maintained representation is changed to emphasize the relevant item and/or exclude the uncued items.
18958218:61	As a consequence, the load of the maintained array in effect would shrink around the retro-cued item.
18958218:62	According to this interpretation, when the probe item appears, it triggers a search through a VSTM array of reduced load.
18958218:63	(2) Alternatively, or additionally, retro-cues could tag the relevant aspects of the VSTM representation for prioritized retrieval.
18958218:64	When the probe is presented, it triggers a shift of attention to the relevant location or object, and in the case of a successful match, any additional search can be avoided.
18958218:65	Our findings suggest a direct action upon VSTM search and retrieval, in addition to any possible mechanisms during maintenance.
18958218:66	The topographical segmentation revealed search-related activity only in the case of neutral retro-cues (N3 RS, map 4).
18958218:67	When it was possible to orient attention to a relevant location, both in the case of spatial retro-cues and when only one item had been present in a neutral retro-cue trial, a different potential occurred, starting around 250 ms, with a posterior parietal distribution (P3e, map 3).
18958218:68	We speculate that this positive parietal potential may index spatial orienting of attention within a VSTM array and/or engaging with a selected target, perhaps in a fashion analogous to the N2PC, related to orienting attention to and/or selecting a relevant item from within a perceptual search array (Eimer, ; Hickey et al., ; Luck and Hillyard, ; Luck et al., ; Wascher and Wauschkuhn, ; Woodman and Luck, ).
18958218:69	Unfortunately, it was not possible to separate trials into those where the relevant target item had occurred within the left vs. right visual field, in order to test whether this parietal potential varies in a way that is specific to the direction of spatial shifts.
18958218:70	Future experiments will test directly the functional relation of this potential to spatial orienting within VSTM search, as well as its laterality.
18958218:71	Our results do not rule out the possibility that retro-cues also exerted top-down biasing effects during the period of VSTM maintenance.
18958218:72	Indeed, we are partial to such possibility, but the current design was not optimally suited to test VSTM maintenance, since there was no direct ERP marker for maintenance that was independent from the physical appearance of the preceding arrays.
18958218:73	Recently, an ERP marker of spatially lateralized maintenance-related delay activity has been described.
18958218:74	After detection and encoding of a set of items to be maintained in VSTM, a negative posterior sustained potential develops over the contralateral scalp, termed CDA (contralateral delay activity) or SPCN (sustained posterior contralateral negativity) (Dell'Acqua et al., ; Klaver et al., ; Vogel and Machizawa, ).
18958218:75	In perceptual search tasks, the CDA follows the N2PC, from which it can be dissociated on the basis of its latency and more medial topography (McCollough et al., ). Its magnitude varies systematically with VSTM load, becoming saturated as the load reaches an individual's capacity (Vogel et al., ). In order to test for direct effects of retro-cues on VSTM maintenance, it will be possible to measure modulation of the CDA triggered by lateralized arrays across several VSTM loads after spatial vs. neutral retro-cues.
18958218:76	After neutral retro-cues, the CDA should continue to vary according to load.
18958218:77	However, if retro-cues effectively diminish the maintained load, the differences in the CDA across load should be significantly reduced or eliminated.
18958218:78	Whereas the topographical segmentation in the present study was highly effective at pinpointing differences between functional neural states between conditions, it cannot point to the neural sources of these differences.
18958218:79	The clear fronto-central distribution of the N3 RS would be consistent with the participation of prefrontal cortical areas, but other areas are also likely to form part of a network for searching through VSTM.
18958218:80	The exact brain areas and their pattern of interaction may furthermore vary depending on the type of VSTM arrays implicated.
18958218:81	Convergent data from methods with complementary high spatial resolution, such as fMRI and TMS, will prove especially useful to delineate the areas involved in VSTM search mechanisms.
18958218:82	Many studies have examined the neural system involved in visual VSTM maintenance and retrieval generally, and have shown it to include prefrontal cortical areas, as well as posterior parietal and specialized occipital-temporal areas (Song and Jiang, ; Todd and Marois, ).
18958218:83	However, less is known about areas specifically involved in searching through the contents of VSTM.
18958218:84	After search-related activity, in the case of neutral retro-cue trials, or the state we suggest is associated to attentional orienting in the case of spatial retro-cue trials, the waveforms display equivalent functional stages, which continue to be characterized by broadly distributed positive potentials that are maximal over midline parietal electrodes.
18958218:85	The strong correlation between the onsets of these functional stages and reaction times, suggests that these potentials are closely linked to decision making and response selection that follow the retrieval of an item from the VSTM array.
18958218:86	Conclusions 
Building on recent work suggesting a high degree of voluntary attentional control over VSTM, we have investigated the ability of spatial orienting to bias search for a target item within a VSTM representation.
18958218:87	By varying the load of the VSTM arrays through which retroactive search was required, we were able to identify search-related behavioral measures and neural activity that varied systematically with load.
18958218:88	In the absence of spatial orienting, behavioral accuracies and response times became increasingly impoverished as VSTM load increased.
18958218:89	A new ERP marker of retroactive search through VSTM was also identified (N3 RS), whose duration and amplitude increased monotonically with the degree of search under increasing VSTM loads.
18958218:90	Spatial orienting had large and significant effects upon both behavioral and ERP markers of load-varying VSTM search.
18958218:91	Effects of load were attenuated or abolished by spatial retro-cues that retrodicted the relevant location for retrieving the target item within VSTM.
18958218:92	The combined behavioral and ERP evidence showing that attentional orienting can optimize search through VSTM poses a strong challenge to standard theories emphasizing the stability and rigidity of VSTM.

21427085:0	INTRODUCTION 
Almost 20 human genetic diseases are caused by specific trinucleotide repeat expansions in different single genes.
21427085:1	The best known of these diseases are fragile X syndrome (FXS), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Huntington’s disease (HD) and a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA).
21427085:2	The mechanisms of pathogenesis differ between these diseases and include impaired transcription (FXS), transcript toxicity (DM1) and protein toxicity (HD and SCAs).
21427085:3	In several SCAs and HD, the expanded CAG repeats present in the open reading frame (ORFs) of the implicated genes ( ATXN and HTT respectively) are translated into polyglutamine tracts in the encoded, functionally unrelated proteins.
21427085:4	This subgroup is commonly referred as the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases.
21427085:5	Pathogenesis in polyQ diseases is triggered by a single mutant allele of the particular gene, which acts in a dominant ‘gain-of-function’ fashion.
21427085:6	Therefore, the allele-specific inhibition of mutant gene expression is considered a promising strategy for establishing causative therapies for these diseases.
21427085:7	Mutant transcript silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) has been attempted in several studies.
21427085:8	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to repeat expansions were targeted.
21427085:9	The efficiency of this approach has increased with the advances in single nucleotide difference discrimination by RNAi reagents.
21427085:10	SNP targeting, however, is limited by the low frequencies of suitable SNPs in the human population, and prospective treatments need to be tailored to individual patients.
21427085:11	The recent identification of specific SNPs associated with CAG repeat expansion in HTT may increase the potential of this strategy.
21427085:12	Non-allele-specific inhibition of HTT gene expression by RNAi has also been shown to offer some advantages.
21427085:13	The specific inhibition of mutant allele expression by targeting expanded CAG repeats could be developed into a more universal therapeutic approach that would potentially be applicable to all polyQ diseases.
21427085:14	But how could it be possible to selectively silence a mutant allele containing ∼40–100 CAG repeats and discriminate it from both the normal allele and the numerous other human transcripts typically containing <20 CAG repeats?
21427085:15	The RNAi approach was initially abandoned after discouraging results were obtained using repeat-targeting siRNAs.
21427085:16	Both alleles of HTT and ATXN3 genes were shown to be silenced in cell culture in response to 21-nt siRNA duplexes composed of CUG/CAG repeats.
21427085:17	Recently, a high degree of selectivity in mutant HTT allele inhibition has been achieved using repeat-targeting PNA and LNA antisense reagents.
21427085:18	The allele-discriminating abilities of these reagents were considerably stronger than those of repeat-targeting siRNA.
21427085:19	In this study, we explored the potential of repeat-targeting RNA duplexes to discriminate between the mutant and the normal HTT transcript to achieve the desired allele selectivity.
21427085:20	We also analyzed the gene selectivity of CAG/CUG duplexes, which is understood as discrimination between HTT and other mRNAs containing CAG and CUG repeat tracts.
21427085:21	We observed some modest discrimination between mutant and normal HTT alleles by repeat-targeting siRNA.
21427085:22	Then, we introduced mutations at specific positions of the repeat-targeting duplex what improved its gene and allele selectivity.
21427085:23	Gene selectivity was further improved through CAG strand inactivation, which was achieved by reducing its length.
21427085:24	We also provide first clues for the mechanism by which preferential mutant huntingtin inhibition and concomitant normal huntingtin activation may occur.
21427085:25	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
CAG and CUG repeats are often polymorphic in length and are among the most frequently occurring triplet repeats in the human transcriptome.
21427085:26	Nearly 200 mRNAs contain CAG repeat tracts, and >100 mRNAs contain tracts of CUG repeats composed of at least six repeated units.
21427085:27	This makes the repeat-targeting therapeutic strategy quite challenging.
21427085:28	We showed that RISC, programmed by either strand of the repeat-targeting CAG/CUG siRNA (d7), was highly active in the silencing of several normal transcripts containing complementary sequences, what resulted in significant loss of cell viability.
21427085:29	In recent years, several rules have been proposed for the design of efficient allele-specific siRNAs, targeting single nucleotide polymorphism sites in RNAs.
21427085:30	These rules showing the importance of specific nucleotides and nucleotide positions for allele discrimination have provided some clues on how to increase the selectivity of the CAG repeat-targeting duplex.
21427085:31	Our strategy was to introduce specific mutations at selected d7 positions to modulate RISC activity.
21427085:32	The mutations at positions 13 and 16 of the antisense strand were selected as these positions were among the ones providing the strongest allele discrimination.
21427085:33	By applying this strategy in the design of the W13 and W13/16 duplexes, we achieved improved gene selectivity and allele selectivity of mutant HTT allele silencing.
21427085:34	The gene selectivity of the W13 and W13/16 duplexes was further increased by taking advantage of recent developments in asymmetric siRNA design.
21427085:35	However, to achieve efficient silencing of mutant huntingtin, the asymmetric duplexes had to be used at a higher concentration than their symmetric counterparts.
21427085:36	Increased gene selectivity was positively correlated with cell viability after transfection with reagents composed of CAG/CUG repeats.
21427085:37	It may be speculated that the similar toxicity order of the reagents composed of repeats will be observed in neurons which are predominant sites of HD pathology.
21427085:38	Notably, d7, which possessed full complementarity to its HTT target, and the W13 and W13/16 duplexes, having either one or two G:U mismatches, silenced the expression of the mutant HTT allele very likely through different mechanisms, as shown by transcript and protein analyses from the same silencing reactions.
21427085:39	The d7 siRNA acts according to the typical RNAi mechanism, in which mutant transcript level decrease is followed by a decrease in mutant huntingtin.
21427085:40	On the contrary, the silencing of the mutant HTT allele by W13/16 seems to occur predominantly, through translational repression, what is suggested by the data presented in . We cannot exclude, however, some contribution from mRNA cleavage mechanism, and deadenylation and degradation mechanism (not addressed in this study), which was recently shown to be the major mechanism by which miRNAs regulate their targets.
21427085:41	As previously demonstrated in miRNA and siRNA studies, the increased number of target sites located in the 3′-UTR of exogenous transcripts facilitates gene silencing.
21427085:42	Here, we show that this phenomenon occurs in overlapping target sites formed by CAG repeats located in the ORF of endogenous HTT transcript.
21427085:43	The observed preferential silencing of the expanded HTT allele also indicates that the possession of a higher number of target sites (rCAG units) is more significant than the effect of a more stable secondary structure, which is likely to be formed by the expanded CAG repeats in cells as it is in vitro.
21427085:44	The observation that W13/16 duplex does not discriminate between the normal and mutant mRNAs of HTT and ATXN3 genes with similar allele selectivity is intriguing and the reason for this difference remains unknown.
21427085:45	The HTT and ATXN3 mRNAs differ in their length, the localization of CAG repeat within ORF and in the structural details of their CAG repeat regions.
21427085:46	These structural differences are, however, unlikely to account for differences in the silencing selectivity of HTT and ATXN3 mRNAs as none of these structures inhibits mutant transcript targeting by RISC.
21427085:47	Little is known about the antisense transcriptomes of HTT and ATXN3 genes which may be implicated in generating differences in allele selectivity of their silencing.
21427085:48	This issue needs further exploration as silencing duplexes composed of repeats may target both sense and antisense transcripts spanning the repeat region and thus influence their normal regulatory functions.
21427085:49	Finally, it was shown earlier that miRNA, fully complementary to target sequence, can induce mRNA cleavage, and that siRNA forming mismatches with its target in the ORF sequence can induce translational inhibition.
21427085:50	We demonstrated here that such mechanistic transition also occurs for repeat-targeting reagents, which substantially improves their gene and allele discriminating properties.
21427085:51	The most intriguing discovery of this study was the observation that the transcriptional up-regulation of normal huntingtin gene expression occurred together with translational mutant huntingtin inhibition.
21427085:52	The transcriptional activation of gene expression using duplex RNAs have recently been demonstrated, and it has been shown that RNAi comes in many types and that its activity is not restricted to silencing effects.
21427085:53	The upregulation of normal HTT level could also result from some unknown compensatory mechanism triggered by mutant HTT silencing.
21427085:54	The transcriptional activation and concomitant translational repression of the two alleles of the same gene using repeat-targeting dsRNA is novel from a mechanistic viewpoint and should be considered a beneficial feature from the perspective of HD therapy using duplex RNA.

20376262:0	Introduction 
Transfusion carries the risk of adverse reactions such as allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, transfusion-related lung injury, and hemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B.
20376262:1	Plasma can transmit most of the infections present in whole blood.
20376262:2	Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a blood product produced from plasma that is separated from packed red cells and platelets, after centrifugation of donated whole blood, and frozen to −30°C or below within six hours after collection.
20376262:3	It is a good source of coagulation factors, including labile factors V and VIII.
20376262:4	The indications for transfusing FFP, cryo precipitate, and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited.
20376262:5	Guidelines for the use of FFP have been developed by several expert groups.
20376262:6	The “Practice Parameters for the use of FFP” by the Task Force of the College of American Pathologists in 1994, was used in this retrospective study, to provide the basis for the appropriate use of FFP . 
There are few indications for FFP usage, which will be similar to the replacement of multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, such as, in liver disease, warfarin overdose, or depletion of coagulation factors in patients receiving large volume transfusions.
20376262:7	Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) will be other indications.
20376262:8	In certain cases where there is a history or clinical course suggestive of coagulopathy, it must be documented by at least one of the following to justify administration of FFP — PT more than 1.5 times the midpoint of normal range, aPTT more than 1.5 times the top of the normal range, or coagulation assay of less than 25% activity.
20376262:9	Our hospital is a teaching hospital as also a referral center for various disciplines in the East Coast of Malaysia, such as, Neurosurgical, Cardiothoracic, Oncology (adult and Pediatric), Solid tumor (Orthopedics), as well as burn cases.
20376262:10	We have noted that the usage for FFP in our hospital is quite high (more than half the number of units of red cells transfused each month).
20376262:11	This study presents an analysis of the practice of FFP transfusion in our hospital as one of the teaching hospitals and tertiary referral centers, with the availability of expertise and facilities in various specialties.
20376262:12	Materials and Methods 
This retrospective study was conducted from October until December 2006.
20376262:13	Blood bank records and coagulation profile results of the patients given FFP from October to December 2006, in Hospital USM, were taken.
20376262:14	Data such as department requesting for FFP, patient's presenting problem, reason for FFP request, date of transfusion, number of units transfused, coagulation profile of patient, and causes of coagulopathy if investigated, were recorded.
20376262:15	The criteria set by the College of American Pathologists in 1994, were used as guidelines .
20376262:16	An FFP transfusion was considered inappropriate if (i) a coagulation profile was not done at the time of request and (ii) the prolongation of PT/PTT was less than 1.5 times that of normal control plasma.
20376262:17	Results 
During the study period, 1698 units of FFP were used, and only 806 (47.47%) units were appropriate.
20376262:18	This means that 892 units of FFP were transfused inappropriately.
20376262:19	A majority of inappropriate transfusions were not accompanied by coagulation test results as a guide to the transfusion and for monitoring purposes.
20376262:20	Some of the cases were not justified to be transfused (normal coagulation profile).
20376262:21	Fresh frozen plasma was used by both medical and surgical specialties, with the Neurosurgical Unit (15.43%) and Intensive Care Unit (32.1%) being the main users . Surgical-based departments were the highest discipline that requested for FFP transfusions, without information on the coagulation profile (25.56%).
20376262:22	The Intensive Care Unit (ICU), showed that most of the requests were based on the coagulation profile of the patients (24.09 vs. 14.60%) . 
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) was the main reason for transfusion, followed by bleeding, mainly in neurosurgical cases.
20376262:23	The other reason for FFP transfusion was as a prophylaxis to anticipated bleeding.
20376262:24	Some of the patients with acute massive blood loss (in motor vehicle cases) were given FFP prior to the availability of the results of coagulation screening tests, due to the urgency of the situation.
20376262:25	Three hundred and forty-six units (20.38%) of FFP were transfused without any coagulation profile done to the patients prior to the transfusion.
20376262:26	Three hundred and sixty-two units (21.13%) requested FFP for correction of only mild prolongation of coagulation profile.
20376262:27	There was a small percentage of FFP requested in the setting of a normal coagulation profile (6.41%), probably given as prophylaxis (as seen in burn cases).
20376262:28	Discussion 
Fresh frozen plasma is a frequently prescribed blood product.
20376262:29	Inappropriate use of FFP exposes patients to risk of transfusion transmissible diseases or allergic and hemolytic reactions caused by A and B antibodies.
20376262:30	In rare cases, antibodies against the patient's granulocytes may cause leukocyte aggregation in pulmonary vessels leading to transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI syndrome).
20376262:31	Any inappropriate use of blood and its components will lead to a wastage of limited resources, depriving more needy patients of their use, increased healthcare cost, and risk of transfusion-related complications, such as viral transmission, which could lead to significant morbidity and mortality.
20376262:32	Therefore, it should only be used when there is a documented coagulation defect, which could be corrected by a reasonable amount of FFP.
20376262:33	Despite the availability of guidelines and protocols, a high rate of inappropriate use has been reported around the world, both in the developed and developing countries.
20376262:34	The high rates of inappropriate transfusion may reflect the uncertainty among clinicians and surgeons, treating the patients, about the appropriate laboratory criteria that forms the basis for FFP usage for clotting support, which can be exemplified by 21.13% of patients receiving transfusion with PT/PTT values of < 1.5 times the normal range (although it is not justified).
20376262:35	Fresh frozen plasma transfusion prophylactically for patients who do not have abnormal coagulation results before or after procedures, with the potential for hemorrhage, is another area of inappropriate use.
20376262:36	This misuse was largely due to misconceptions regarding the hemostatic effectiveness of FFP, although there have been so many efforts to improve these misconceptions by conducting seminars or by continuous medical education to all the surgeons as well as clinicians.
20376262:37	Attempts to formulate guidelines for proper FFP use have been faced with controversy and lack of a firm scientific foundation.
20376262:38	However, a program of daily monitoring of FFP usage combined with continuous education has significantly reduced the usage of FFP by 77% at the William Beaumont Hospital.
20376262:39	A systematic review of FFP requests may be more educational and beneficial in the long run compared to a retrospective review.
20376262:40	Some centers have also modified blood product request forms, to incorporate indications for transfusion, based on clinical and laboratory findings.
20376262:41	Here, in our center, in cases where there is no indication stated on the request forms, we follow up with the treating doctors to clarify whether the indications for transfusion are justifiable or not.
20376262:42	Furthermore, investigations of all abnormal APTT/PT are necessary as a guide for appropriate treatment or transfusions.
20376262:43	Any use of FFP needs to be followed by a coagulation profile request as a monitoring basis, to assess the adequacy of transfusions, and this will be the guide to whether further transfusions are mandatory or not.
20376262:44	With the exception of emergency situations, when timely clotting assay results are not available, the administration of plasma in coagulopathy is judged mainly for clinical perspectives as has occurred in 20.38% of the cases.
20376262:45	In this situation, it is justified to give the products prior to the laboratory parameters becoming available.
20376262:46	There are other situations where products more effective and safer than FFP are available for correction of coagulopathy, such as, recombinant or virally inactivated specific clotting factor concentrates, for treatment of hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, and hypofibrinogenemic states, and prothrombin complex concentrates and vitamin K for warfarin reversal.
20376262:47	Conclusion 
This study indicates that the practice of FFP transfusion needs to be improved.
20376262:48	An FFP request should be based on clinical and laboratory evidence of coagulopathy.
20376262:49	In the long-term, there is a need to monitor and review all the requests for FFP continuously, to ensure a safe and cost-effective practice of FFP transfusion.
21713101:0	Introduction 
The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta exceeding the normal diameter by more than 50% (Upchurch and Schaub, ).
21713101:1	AAAs are associated with advanced age, male gender, cigarette smoking, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and a genetic predisposition (van Vlijmen-van Keulen et al., ; Golledge et al., ; Lloyd-Jones et al., ). The histopathologic features of AAAs are characterized by chronic inflammation in the vessel wall, tissue degeneration and remodeling, and depletion of medial smooth muscle cells (Thompson, ; McCormick et al., ).
21713101:2	With an aging population, AAAs are becoming common vascular disorders with life-threatening implications such as aortic rupture, which has been reported to have a mortality rate as high as 90% (Lloyd-Jones et al., ). AAAs account for more than 15,000 deaths/year in the United States (Baxter et al., ). Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs and translating the knowledge from basic science to the clinical realm is certain to be a promising step to prevent this condition.
21713101:3	Since most information of human AAAs is obtained from pathological specimens after surgical intervention, there is a need to have animal models to mimic the entire progression sequence of aneurysm evolution.
21713101:4	Several rodent models of AAA have been developed either via genetic exploitation or via chemical methods; their advantages and limitations have been considered (Daugherty and Cassis, ).
21713101:5	The angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced mouse AAA model in the atherosclerotic-susceptible strain (apolipoprotein E deficient; apoE −/−) has become the most widely used model in recent years because of its simplicity and because certain facets of the model resemble human disease acquisition, including male gender preponderance in the setting of mild hypertension with enhanced incidence in the presence of hyperlipidemia (Daugherty et al., ; Saraff et al., ; Daugherty and Cassis, ).
21713101:6	There is a well-defined time course of events in this model with early macrophage infiltration into the smooth muscle-rich medial layer of the aneurysm-prone area, transmedial dissection that causes rapid luminal expansion within the first 7 days of AngII infusion, with subsequent complex inflammatory events that include intramural thrombus formation, elastin degradation and profound remodeling in which the thrombus is often resorbed and replaced by fibrous tissue interspersed with leukocytes (Daugherty et al., ).
21713101:7	However, there are still some parameters such as aortic rupture death and hemodynamical changes within the aorta upon aneurysm formation that are poorly defined.
21713101:8	In this study, we attempt to reveal the inflammatory progression patterns during aneurysm formation, as well as elucidate the incidence and site-specificity of aortic rupture and follow in vivo aneurysmal development with 2D- and 3D-ultrasound imaging.
21713101:9	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The Ang II-induced mouse model of AAA is characterized by macrophage infiltration, elastic media degeneration, aortic dissection, thrombus formation, aneurysmal wall remodeling, and aortic rupture (Daugherty et al., ; Saraff et al., ; Cao et al., ). Here, we have carried out a detailed time-frame and site-specific analysis of aortic rupture combined with ultrasound imaging of aneurysms.
21713101:10	In humans, about 80% of aortic aneurysms occur in the abdominal region (Baxter et al., ). The well-established murine AAA model used here by us and many other investigators shares several common features with human AAAs as mentioned above, as well as male gender preponderance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (apoE −/− mice).
21713101:11	There are, however, certain differences.
21713101:12	For instance, in mice these aneurysms occur most frequently in the suprarenal aorta as opposed to the infrarenal location in humans.
21713101:13	Moreover, aortic dissection and rupture are early events in the mouse model in the absence of atherosclerosis, in contrast to the complications of dissection and rupture that tend to occur in late-stage, large aneurysms with manifest atherosclerosis in humans.
21713101:14	Aortic rupture is a fatal complication of both human and mouse AAAs.
21713101:15	Death-associated aortic rupture was only reported at ≈10% when this Ang II-induced AAA model was first established (Saraff et al., ). Recently, high rupture mortality was reported in apoE −/− mice (47%) (Chamberlain et al., ) and in IFN-γ/apoE double knockout mice (50%) (King et al., ). In our study we observed 25% (16 of 65) aortic rupture deaths in apoE −/− mice and found that most ruptures happened in the first week of Ang II infusion (12 of 16; Table ).
21713101:16	Interestingly, we found that rupture was almost as common in the aortic arch as it was in the suprarenal abdominal site, where aneurysms usually develop in this model (Figure ).
21713101:17	On one occasion, rupture occurred during the ultrasound scanning procedure indicating that pressure from the scan-head probe on the body surface could be sufficient to trigger AAA rupture.
21713101:18	Previously, flow patterns and fluid dynamics modeling have been reported in human AAAs (Castro et al., ; Baek et al., ; Les et al., ), with very little insight into patterns in mice.
21713101:19	In the present study, we were able to monitor the progression of AAA in this mouse model using non-invasive, high-resolution ultrasound specially designed for small animals.
21713101:20	This imaging system not only allowed us to assess aortic diameter (Figure ), which significantly correlated with postmortem morphology aortic measurement ( r 2 = 0.86, P < 0.0001) and 3D geometry (Figure ), which Goldberg et al. reported to have strong correlation with histology volumes reconstructed by aligning each 2D digitized section.
21713101:21	The imaging also allowed us to dynamically monitor flow patterns during AAA formation at three time-points.
21713101:22	One limitation to this methodology is that more frequent, repeated exams necessitates multiple periods of deep isoflurane anesthesia and depilation for scan-head contact, which can lead to altered mouse physiology and skin lesions.
21713101:23	So, we have opted for analysis at weekly intervals.
21713101:24	In a previous report, aortic expansion induced by Ang II infusion was detected by ultrasound (Barisione et al., ), but in our present study details of complex fluid flow patterns were observed and were already evident at day 7 post-Ang II infusion with unsteady flow, shed vortices that impinge upon the distal wall, and re-circulating flow (Figure ).
21713101:25	Using a computational fluid dynamics model, Baek et al. found the impingement region coincides with the location of rupture.
21713101:26	Thus, if the repair process, which includes thrombus formation/coagulation/fibrosis in a dynamic remodeling fashion cannot override the degenerative process after aortic dissection at the intimal layer, then adventitial weakening will inevitably lead to aortic rupture with subsequent hemorrhage and death.
21713101:27	The role of fluid mechanics in the formation of the AAA remains an open question.
21713101:28	Although the aneurysms studied here develop from Ang II infusion via an initial dissection in the intimal wall, once formed the local fluid mechanics can play a critical role in the growth and subsequent rupture of the AAA.
21713101:29	In our studies, there is an area in which the local fluid mechanics are favorable to the formation of thrombus (slow recirculation zone above the distal entrance to the aneurysm at the dissection) and hence growth of the vessel wall.
21713101:30	The impingement of the shed vortex on the distal end of the aneurysm may also give rise to an area susceptible to expansion or even rupture.
21713101:31	In future studies we aim to explore the role of the fluid mechanics on the rupture risk of mouse AAA.
21713101:32	Inflammation is commonly recognized to be the key to aneurysmal diseases (Wassef et al., ; Norman and Powell, ).
21713101:33	In our study, we found prominent inflammatory macrophage infiltration at the site of elastic media break down (Figure ).
21713101:34	Tieu et al. found that an IL-6/MCP-1 amplification loop accelerates macrophage-mediated vascular inflammation leading to aortic dissection in mice, while others (King et al., ; Wang et al., ) found TGF-β and interferon-γ to protect against inflammatory aortic aneurysm progression.
21713101:35	Therefore, pharmacological intervention to block inflammatory pathways may prevent the progression of AAAs.
21713101:36	Currently, there are no extant therapeutics for blocking AAA progression although agents such as statins, doxycycline, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists have all been shown to modulate the progression of aortic aneurysms in murine models (Wassef et al., ). The selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib has shown efficacy to decrease Ang II-induced mouse AAAs (King et al., ), but this class of drugs enhances cardiovascular risk in humans.
21713101:37	To avoid such hazard, we are currently investigating downstream prostanoid receptor antagonists to target attenuation of AAA progression.

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
16925843:0	Background 
Predicting complete protein-coding genes in human DNA remains a significant challenge, as the results of the ENCODE Genome Annotation Assessment Project (EGASP) workshop clearly demonstrate.
16925843:1	Although much progress has been made of late in the use of increasingly sophisticated models of gene structure, particularly those that utilize homology evidence within a phylogenetic framework (for example, ), it is clear that there is yet much room for improvement.
16925843:2	In the wake of the most recent spate of advances in gene structure modeling, we additionally observe that the sophistication in modeling techniques has to some degree outstripped our ability to ascribe, with high confidence, specific reasons for the difference in performance between competing gene finding systems, particularly those that utilize similar underlying models and/or forms of evidence, but that differ in the particulars of their implementation.
16925843:3	Although it is tempting in some cases to ascribe differences in performance to conspicuous differences in the published descriptions of two software systems, it is clear that such reasoning can be highly unreliable when the published descriptions are not complete, when the systems under consideration are highly complex, and when the source code is not available to third parties for detailed comparison.
16925843:4	Unfortunately, these conditions hold for most gene finding systems in use today, with few exceptions.
16925843:5	An additional complication arises out of the use of different training protocols, which can have a profound effect on the performance of a single system , making interpretation of the differences between systems, absent knowledge of precisely how they were trained, very risky indeed.
16925843:6	It is clear, however, that accurate interpretation of such differences is essential for progress in the computational science of gene structure modeling.
16925843:7	For these reasons we decided to undertake, in conjunction with our EGASP activities, a series of controlled experiments designed to measure the relative influence of various components in our underlying models.
16925843:8	Whereas the high-level EGASP evaluation included in this volume  compares disparate systems, each consisting of a complex code base with virtually no shared components between the competing systems, it was our hope that by performing a number of controlled experiments, each within the environment of a single software system, we could help to foster a more fine-grained understanding of the relative merits of different modeling decisions for gene structure prediction.
16925843:9	Thus, our hope was to complement the overall EGASP comparison with a smaller-scale (but potentially very valuable) comparison of modeling techniques for human protein-coding genes.
16925843:10	Our efforts can be partitioned into two distinct sets of experiments.
16925843:11	The first set involves the inclusion or exclusion of various states in our generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) gene finder GeneZilla.
16925843:12	Starting with a basic state topology for eukaryotic gene structure, we proceeded to incorporate additional states for biological features such as signal peptides and CpG islands, measuring the impact of these modifications on two sets of held-out test genes.
16925843:13	We additionally investigated the effect of training set size, as well as the utility of isochore modeling via an external HMM for isochore boundary predictions.
16925843:14	We also offer anecdotal observations on the different levels of effort required to achieve similar levels of accuracy in our two GHMM-based gene finders, despite their having nearly identical underlying models and algorithms.
16925843:15	The latter observation further bolsters our contention that the differences in performance between competing systems often cannot be ascribed with any confidence to differences in modeling decisions, due to the many other sources of variation in the training and operation of these complex software systems.
16925843:16	The second set of experiments involved the differential inclusion of various evidence tracks in our comparative and integrative 'combiner' program, JIGSAW, which was found to perform as well as or better than any of the other entries in the GENCODE competition.
16925843:17	Because JIGSAW is an integrative program that can combine arbitrary forms of evidence (including the predictions from our other gene finders and sequence analysis programs), our early expectations were that this tool would dominate our submissions to the GENCODE competition, and hence we have concentrated our efforts on this particular tool.
16925843:18	Our discussion will therefore focus correspondingly on this most important component of our pipeline.
16925843:19	We give a description of our prediction pipeline and the major components in it, which we have used repeatedly and with much success for the annotation of a number of invertebrate eukaryotic genomes sequenced and/or annotated at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).
16925843:20	Because the components that we describe are all released under open-source software licenses, others are thereby enabled to reproduce any of our computational results and to investigate extensions to our methods.
16925843:21	In this way, we hope that our efforts will aid others in contributing to the advancement of automated genome annotation techniques.
16925843:22	Results 
Discussion 
Several factors help to explain JIGSAW's overall strong performance in EGASP.
16925843:23	Critical to JIGSAW's success was access to quality cDNA evidence made available through the UCSC genome browser.
16925843:24	Inclusion of the KnownGene track, for example, led to a noticeable improvement in predictions at the whole gene level.
16925843:25	Equally important was the use of a wide array of evidence sources, including multiple ab initio gene finders and non-human expression evidence.
16925843:26	The use of a training procedure allowed JIGSAW to conduct its own 'genome annotation assessment project' to compute empirically the most reliable sources of gene structure evidence.
16925843:27	Accurate individual evidence sources were identified as well as evidence combinations, where accuracy was dependant on the presence of multiple tracks of evidence.
16925843:28	Therefore, gene calls were made in the presence of reliable human cDNAs, but also in the absence of cDNAs when alternative support for a gene was present.
16925843:29	While the EGASP experiment has ably demonstrated the need for further improvements to this community's suite of available computational gene prediction methods, the results of our own study suggest that greater gains in predictive accuracy may be made via advances at the level of integrative evidence-based methods, such as those employed by JIGSAW, than by efforts directed at the improved modeling of individual biological features by ab initio HMM-based models.
16925843:30	Although such models are clearly necessary for the success of integrative approaches, the impact of expression and homology data on the present study strongly suggests that future efforts may be best spent in improving the fidelity of homology modeling at the higher levels of integrative gene structure modeling.
16925843:31	In particular, our successes in utilizing human mRNAs and alignments to curated human proteins suggest that while evolutionary modeling of cross-species conservation may account for a significant portion of the 'low-hanging fruit' that can and should be incorporated into state-of-the-art gene-finding pipelines, improved methods of evaluating similarity to known proteins and mRNAs and of reliably incorporating such evidence within an integrative environment may yet offer significant gains in predictive accuracy.
16925843:32	Our own research agenda for the near future includes the application of recent phylogenetic HMM approaches at the level of both ab initio and integrative gene finding and, in particular, the application of such approaches within the JIGSAW framework.
16925843:33	The fact that JIGSAW was able to perform so well in comparison to the other comparative methods applied within EGASP is an encouraging sign for this line of research.
16925843:34	In contrast to the 'more information is always better' mantra suggested by the JIGSAW results, our experiences in modeling various features within the strict GHMM framework suggest that the higher-fidelity modeling of biological entities within DNA sequence, at least within the probabilistic framework of a GHMM, offers far fewer gains, especially considering the level of effort required in the form of additional software development and testing.
16925843:35	Though the precise reasons for this remain somewhat obscure, a number of possible explanations readily present themselves, including the thorny issue of generative versus discriminative modeling for biosequence analysis, which remains somewhat under-characterized in our opinion, though some effort is now being directed at this important issue [ , ].
16925843:36	Intuitively, we find it disturbing that the explicit modeling of features of clear biological significance (for example, signal peptides and CpG islands) would seem to provide no advantage in the predictive modeling of protein-coding genes.
16925843:37	Although our own speculations regarding this conundrum point to a basic inadequacy in the HMM modeling formalism for the purpose of optimally parsing gene structures in DNA, work yet remains to be done in order to more rigorously characterize the various modeling paradigms and their applicability to the gene structure modeling problem.
16925843:38	In comparing the performance of the individual ab initio predictors to that of our integrative program JIGSAW, it is clear that the ability to automatically annotate a single isoform of a gene is much improved from the days of running a single gene finder on a sequence, as shown by the fact that 70% of JIGSAW's predicted gene structures in the ENCODE regions exactly matched the human curation, with 93% of the total protein coding nucleotides correctly detected.
16925843:39	We hope in the near future to improve upon these numbers through various enhancements, which we are now in the process of formulating for future investigations.
16925843:40	The perennial question of how much training data is necessary to achieve a certain level of accuracy with an ab initio gene finder has been somewhat addressed by the experiments performed within the context of our GHMM-based gene finder.
16925843:41	While additional experiments within the contexts of other gene finders remain to be done, our present results suggest that for novel genomes and at the lower end of the sample-size domain, steep gains may be expected for small increases in sample size.
16925843:42	The practical significance of this result resides in the way that training data for obscure genomes tends to be produced.
16925843:43	For heavily fragmented genomes of obscure organisms, for example, training genes tend to be scarce, and the effort involved in increasing sample sizes may be very laborious.
16925843:44	Nevertheless, our results, assuming they generalize to other eukaryotic genomes, suggest that such labor when undertaken with appropriate care may significantly impact the accuracy of the resulting gene finder, thereby justifying the greater effort in developing such training sets.
16925843:45	It is important to note that while both of our GHMM-based gene finders have seen extensive use for genome annotation efforts at TIGR over the past several years, and despite the near equivalence of their state topologies and decoding algorithms, we have often observed that the two programs can produce significantly different accuracy results, with sometimes one or the other program performing better, and no clear trend indicating any overall advantage of either program across all genomes.
16925843:46	In contrast, we have often observed that the largest improvements in predictive accuracy have come about through improvements to our training practices , as opposed to improvements in the actual GHMM software.
16925843:47	The latter observations, which have been further bolstered by our experiences with EGASP, support the notion that gross comparison of predictive accuracy between different software systems may be of limited scientific value in assessing modeling and algorithmic options for gene prediction, and points instead to the need for controlled experiments within the context of an individual software code base, or, more ideally, replicated across several independent software implementations.
16925843:48	We believe that the more widespread adoption of such practices could greatly improve computational gene modeling as a rigorous science.
16925843:49	In conclusion, we believe that the more effective integration of multiple forms of evidence (for example, DNA, RNA, and protein), as opposed to higher-fidelity ab initio modeling of DNA alone, offers the greatest potential gains for further improvements in human gene prediction.
16925843:50	With this in mind, we would suggest that data from other types of experiments, such as protein mass spectrometry, might offer further gains.
16925843:51	We have now reached the point where our pipeline predicts roughly three quarters of the genes exactly, missing only 3% of the genes completely.
16925843:52	This suggests that further efforts in human gene finding might be more productively applied to refining existing gene annotations than to generating new ones.
16925843:53	It is important for the human genome community to recognize that uncurated de novo gene predictions can be highly inaccurate, and this has implications for expression studies and other experiments based on genome annotation.
16925843:54	We would also point out that sequencing centers have now completed draft genomes for hundreds of additional species, with many more to come.
16925843:55	The data presented in this study makes it clear that in order to predict genes accurately in the countless genomes yet to come, we need both automated gene finders and a steady source of independent evidence such as mRNAs from those species.

17610718:0	Background 
Herbal medicine represents a traditional form of medical practice in human history.
17610718:1	Current ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology focus on the systematic exploration of medicinal herbs among folk medicines . 
Half a century after the launch of chemotherapy for tumor treatment , anti-neoplastic drugs is now indispensable for treating hematopoietic malignancies.
17610718:2	The concept of combination therapy in oncology is based on the notion that leukemia cells resistant to one drug may be susceptible to other drugs.
17610718:3	Clinically, the success of combination treatments can be hampered by the development of broad-spectrum or multidrug resistance (MDR).
17610718:4	Two strategies to cope with this problem are to modulate multidrug resistance by inhibitors of MDR-conferring proteins  or to develop new anticancer drugs without involvement in MDR phenotypes.
17610718:5	Enormous efforts have been spent to develop such as resistance modulation to improve treatment for leukemia, but resistance modulators still frequently show intolerable high toxicity . Natural products provide a rich source for developing novel drugs with anti-leukemia activities.
17610718:6	The Natural Products Branch of the National Cancer Institute (USA) has collected and tested over 100,000 natural extracts of plants and invertebrates . The vast experience of traditional medicines (e.g., TCM) may facilitate the identification of novel active substances.
17610718:7	This approach has been successful.
17610718:8	Camptothecin from Camptotheca acuminata represents only one outstanding example for such compounds derived from TCM . Considering the severe limitations of current cancer chemotherapy, it would be desirable to have novel drugs which are active against otherwise resistant tumor cells.
17610718:9	In 1996, we started a research program on the molecular pharmacology and pharmacogenomics of the natural products derived from TCM . This project became fruitful for the identification and characterization of compounds with anti-tumor and anti-viral activities.
17610718:10	Apart from artemisinin and its prominent semi-synthetic derivative artesunate which are both approved drugs , we have analyzed cellular and molecular mechanisms of several other chemically characterized natural products derived from TCM, e.g., arsenic trioxide, ascaridol, berberine, cantharidin, cephalotaxine, curcumin, homoharringtonine, luteolin, isoscopoletin, scopoletin and others [ - ].
17610718:11	Furthermore, several novel bioactive compounds, namely tetracentronsine A, tetracentronside A, B and C, the two novel α-tetralone derivatives, berchemiaside A and B, and the novel flavonoid quercetin-3- O -(2-acetyl-α-L-arabinofuranosid), were described and analyzed in our investigations, [ - ].
17610718:12	Artemisinin displays a marked anti-malarial activity . Various derivatives (artesunate, artemether, arteether, artelinate) have been synthesized to improve this anti-malarial activity.
17610718:13	In 2002, we began a study on the antiviral effects of artesunate.
17610718:14	We demonstrated for the first time that artesunate inhibits NF-κB activity, leading to the inhibition of viral replication.
17610718:15	NF-κB is involved in the transcriptional regulation of early and late proteins of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) necessary for viral replication . Artesunate also acts against cytomegaloviruses in vivo . We also showed that the antiviral activity of artesunate is not limited to HCMV.
17610718:16	Herpes simplex virus 1, hepatitis B and C viruses and others can also be inhibited by artemisinin and artesunate [ , ].
17610718:17	TCM is well-known for its unique diagnosis and treatment system, whereas other traditional medicines in Asia, such as TVM, have not gained the same acceptance in medical practice.
17610718:18	Profoundly influenced by TCM, TVM exhibits its uniqueness via an influence from indigenous medicine of southern Vietnam.
17610718:19	Detailed surveys of TVM and TCM can be found in recent publications [ - ].
17610718:20	Cantharidin 
Pharmacogenomics of cantharidin 
Cantharidin and norcantharidin (a demethylated cantharidin derivative, which also has clinical potential) are protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors [ - ].
17610718:21	This activity appears necessary for the growth inhibition activity of these compounds . Protein phosphatases are involved, among others, in the regulation of multiple cellular processes including apoptosis, signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism and calcium transport .
17610718:22	Thus, although the biochemical target of cantharidin and norcantharidin is known, the critical molecular pathways by which cantharidin and norcantharidin cause growth inhibition and cell death are unclear [ - ].
17610718:23	In an attempt to identify the molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to cantharidin, we analyzed the microarray database of the National Cancer Institute (USA).
17610718:24	Out of 9706 genes, 21 genes whose mRNA expression in 60 tumor cell lines correlated with the highest correlation coefficients to inhibition concentration 50% (IC 50) values were selected by COMPARE analysis and false discovery rate calculation . These genes were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis to reveal whether the expression profiles of these genes are useful to predict sensitivity or resistance of cell lines to cantharidin.
17610718:25	The mRNA expression of the 21 identified genes were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping (Figure ).
17610718:26	The resulting dendrogram with the genes analyzed on the right can be divided into three major branches.
17610718:27	The dendrogram on the top shows the cell lines and can also be separated into three major branches.
17610718:28	By generation of a cluster image map from both dendrograms, areas with different mRNA expression levels became apparent (Figure ).
17610718:29	The distribution of sensitive or resistant cell lines on the dendrogram was significantly different indicating that cellular response to cantharidin is predictable by these genes . 
While the specific functions of the proteins encoded by the 21 identified genes are diverse, it is intriguing that many of them are in one way or another involved in DNA damage response, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis .
17610718:30	Since cantharidin is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), PPP1R13B, the regulatory subunit 13B of PP1, is particularly interesting.
17610718:31	PPP1R13B plays a central role in the regulation of apoptosis via its interaction with the tumor suppressor gene p53.
17610718:32	It regulates p53 by enhancing DNA binding activity and transactivation function of p53 on the promoters of proapoptotic genes in vivo .
17610718:33	The role of PP1 in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions  and the induction of cytosine arabinoside-induced apoptosis have been shown .
17610718:34	It is, therefore, reasonable to hypothesize that PPP1R13B also has specific functions in cantharidin-induced DNA repair and apoptosis.
17610718:35	PP1 is one of the four major serine/threonine protein phosphatases, and new protein phosphatases are still emerging.
17610718:36	They are crucial regulators of many cellular functions by altering the phosphorylation of target proteins.
17610718:37	The level of phosphorylation is a well-controlled balance by the opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases.
17610718:38	The PP1 holoenzyme consists of catalytic and regulatory subunits.
17610718:39	Four catalytic (a, b, c, d) and more than a dozen regulatory subunits have so far been identified.
17610718:40	The regulatory subunits modulate the substrate specificity and target the holoenzyme to specific subcellular localizations.
17610718:41	Apoptosis and DNA damage and repair induced by cantharidin 
The microarray analyses were used to find the genes responsible for the action of cantharidin.
17610718:42	These studies showed that many apoptosis-related genes and genes involved in DNA damage and repair correlated with the IC 50 values for cantharidin in the NCI cell line panel.
17610718:43	We analyzed the relevance of apoptosis and DNA damage and repair induced by cantharidin in more detail.
17610718:44	In a recent study, we reported that cantharidin induces apoptosis by a p53-dependent mechanism in leukemia cells . Cantharidin causes both DNA single- and double-strand breaks.
17610718:45	Colony forming assays with knockout and transfectant cell lines showed that DNA polymerase β conferred increased cell survival after cantharidin treatment, indicating that base excision repair rather than nucleotide excision repair is important for cantharidin-induced DNA lesions.
17610718:46	Oxidative-stress resistant thymic lymphoma-derived WEHI7.2 variants are also more resistant to cantharidin.
17610718:47	These data suggest that cantharidin treatment causes oxidative stress which damages DNA and triggers p53-dependent apoptosis.
17610718:48	It has been difficult to determine all critical events responsible for cantharidin-induced cytotoxicity.
17610718:49	PP1 and PP2A which are inhibited by cantharidin [ - ], modulate a large number of cellular processes by counteracting the activity of kinases to provide the critical on/off switch for many pathways . Cell cycle progression is one process where the increases and decreases of both kinases and phosphatases are necessary to complete the cycle.
17610718:50	Studies from different laboratories agree that cantharidin and norcantharidin treatment results in a G 2/M cell cycle block in many cell types [ - ].
17610718:51	However, several of these studies suggest that cell cycle blockade does not cause cantharidin-induced apoptosis [ - ].
17610718:52	Our data show that cantharidin treatment causes DNA strand breaks in CCRF-CEM cells . DNA strand breaks have also been documented in oral cancer KB cells after norcantharidin treatment . A correlation between an increase in the mRNA level for several DNA damage repair genes in the 60 cell line panel and resistance to cantharidin argues for DNA damage as a mechanistic component of cantharidin-induced apoptosis.
17610718:53	This is consistent with the role of p53 in cantharidin-induced apoptosis in this study because one of the major functions of p53 is to induce apoptosis when DNA damage exceeds a threshold .
17610718:54	Moreover, p53 plays a role in norcantharidin-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells . Phosphorylation of p53 stabilizes the protein ; inhibition of phosphatases may enhance the ability of p53 to exert its effect.
17610718:55	The ability of Bcl-2 to protect against cantharidin-induced apoptosis seen in this study indicates that DNA damage-triggered mitochondrial pathway is involved.
17610718:56	Mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspases involved in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis have also been detected in other cell types after cantharidin or norcantharidin treatment [ , - ].
17610718:57	A role of the Fas/CD95 extrinsic pathway of apoptosis has been reported , but not confirmed by other authors . 
The cross-resistance of the oxidative stress resistant WEHI7.2 variants to cantharidin suggests that cantharidin causes oxidative stress which plays a role in cantharidin-induced apoptosis.
17610718:58	Analogs of cantharidin increase xanthine oxidase activity which would increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) .
17610718:59	It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that oxidative stress is involved in the induction of DNA damage by cantharidin.
17610718:60	Increase of endogenous ROS level has repeatedly been shown to cause significant DNA breakage . 
Resistance to oxidative stress, increases of Bcl-2, or the presence of wild type p53 have a modest effect on cantharidin-induced toxicity.
17610718:61	Mutational inactivation of PolB but not of ERCC1, key enzymes of base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair pathways respectively, exerted an effect on cantharidin cytotoxicity.
17610718:62	This suggests that cantharidin induces non-bulky DNA lesions that are repaired by base excision repair but not by nucleotide excision repair.
17610718:63	Lesions induced by oxidative stress are repaired by base excision repair and non-homologous end joining .
17610718:64	This suggests the possibility that multiple mechanisms are responsible for cantharidin-induced toxicity.
17610718:65	In this study, for example, p53 status affected the IC 50 of cantharidin, however, cells with mutated p53 still died.
17610718:66	A p53-independent mechanism of cantharidin-induced cytotoxicity has been detected in hepatoma cells . Because cantharidin and norcantharidin inhibit phosphatases, it would not be surprising that alterations in multiple pathways are critical for apoptosis.
17610718:67	The microarray data comparing cantharidin treated and untreated HL-60 cells suggest that cantharidin affects multiple pathways . Given that multiple mechanisms are involved in cantharidin-induced toxicity, the drug will likely be most effective against cancer cells with a specific phenotype.
17610718:68	It is important to test whether this is a cancer cell that has acquired mutations in DNA repair pathways but retains wild-type p53 and sensitivity to oxidative stress.
17610718:69	Discussion 
Although the potential use of natural products is increasingly recognized in oncology, it has been estimated that so far only 5000 plant species have been properly studied for possible medical applications . Considering that there are 250,000 to 300,000 plant species on this planet, the majority of this treasure still awaits retrieval.
17610718:70	The isolation of natural products and the elucidation of their chemical structures enable pharmacological and molecular biological investigations comparable to those conducted on chemically synthesized compounds to be conducted.
17610718:71	The identification of target molecules relevant to diseases allows screening for natural products that are able to inhibit these targets.
17610718:72	This may lay groundwork for the development of rational treatment of diseases such as cancer.
17610718:73	This kind of research also opens avenues for the prediction of individual response of a cancer patient to therapy.
17610718:74	We expect that strategies for individualized tumor therapies will lead to improved results for the patients.
17610718:75	Small molecule inhibitors have the potential to increase tumor specificity and reduce adverse side effects on normal tissues.
17610718:76	This concept of individualized tumor therapy is also of great importance for small molecule inhibitors derived from traditional herbal medicines such as TCM and TVM.
17610718:77	Applying this strategy, we identified cantharidin as a potential drug candidate.
17610718:78	These results are supported by findings that cantharidin does not cause myelosuppression in patients  and is effective against cells with a multidrug resistance phenotype , both of which are major obstacles of established anti-cancer drugs.
17610718:79	A drawback of cantharidin is its acute toxicity due to its effect on mucus membranes and the urinary tract . Understanding the mechanism of cantharidin action will help in the derivation of related compounds that have reduced toxicity while preserving the anti-tumor effect . 
Cantharidin's ability to act against multidrug-resistant cells makes it an ideal compound for individualized cancer treatment.
17610718:80	If multidrug resistance of a tumor can be detected by molecular and pharmacological means prior to standard chemotherapy, the therapy regimen may be altered and drugs that act against multidrug-resistant tumors (e.g., cantharidin) may be applied.
17610718:81	Such escape treatment strategies are promising.
17610718:82	Our pharmacogenomic approach points to genes involved in oxidative stress response, DNA repair and apoptosis.
17610718:83	The generation of hypotheses by genomic technologies and their verification by molecular biological methods provides an attractive approach.
17610718:84	On the other hand, microarray technologies alone are not sufficient to elucidate molecular mechanisms of cytotoxic compounds in cancer cells.
17610718:85	Microarray expression profiling can deliver candidate genes on a transcriptome-wide level.
17610718:86	While this approach is much faster than traditional techniques, not all associations of genes with the response of tumor cells to a drug under investigation are of causal relationships and some may be even unrelated processes.
17610718:87	Therefore, we should only take validated findings seriously.
17610718:88	Conclusion 
TCM and TVM are valuable sources for identifying potential natural products to treat cancer.
17610718:89	In the case with cantharidin, the use of pharmacogenomic and molecular biological techniques help elucidate the modes of action of the natural product.
17610718:90	While cantharidin is not involved in the multidrug resistance phenotype, it induces the generation of ROS and DNA damage, thereby leading to apoptosis.

17417714:0	Introduction 
Psychopathological research has only recently started to focus on the expression of problematic development at a very young age, i.e., younger than 18 months, and few data are available on the expression of problem behavior in somewhat older children between 1- and 3-year-old [ , ].
17417714:1	Indeed, the lack of normative data for normal and deviant development in children younger than 18 months may lead to inadequate early recognition of serious behavior problems [ , ].
17417714:2	The differentiation of normal behavior from problem behavior is particularly challenging in young children . Many symptoms of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence are considered to be relatively normal in preschool-age children.
17417714:3	For example, during the preschool years, aggressive, hyperactive, and non-compliance behaviors and separation problems are relatively common and can be viewed as relatively normal within a developmental perspective . Still, these behaviors can be quite stressing for parents and are generally referred to as problem behaviors.
17417714:4	Children younger than 18 months are learning to control themselves, to become attached to people and objects, and to explore, and are only beginning to form stable behavior patterns.
17417714:5	Earlier studies reported that problem behavior affected between 7.3% and 24% of 2- and 3-year-old children [ , , , , , ], but there are few data for children younger than this age.
17417714:6	One developmental screening study reported that about 10% of infants had emotional and behavioral problems in the first year of life , and another study reported that about 6% of the 1-year-old children had high scores on the Difficult Child domain of the Parenting Stress Index . 
An important reason to study behavior at a young age is that it may predict problem behavior at a later age.
17417714:7	For example, indices of temperament at 3 years were found to predict the presence and the type of psychiatric disorder in young adulthood , and behavior problems at 2 years, such as aggression, non-compliance, and difficult temperament, were valuable predictors of lasting problems at a later stage of development . Approximately 50% of the 2- and 3-year-old children with externalizing psychiatric disorders continued to have these problems later in life . Such problems appear to be stable from an age of 18 months onward , but to our knowledge stability has not been evaluated in younger children.
17417714:8	More knowledge on the expression and stability of problem behaviors before the age of 18 months would be advantageous, especially for doctors and nurses working in well baby clinics.
17417714:9	In the Netherlands, infants visit well baby clinics according to a fixed scheme.
17417714:10	At 14 months there is a relatively extensive check up.
17417714:11	Since this is a moment for vaccination the attendance rate for this check up is high.
17417714:12	Therefore, more knowledge on problem behaviors at especially 14-month-old was desirable.
17417714:13	The current study was designed to investigate behaviors at this young age and had the following aims.
17417714:14	The first aim was to examine the occurrence of problem behaviors or lack of competences at younger age that are considered to be psychopathological in later childhood.
17417714:15	A second aim was to examine whether the constructs of problem behaviors and competences usually found in older children are already present at 14 and 19 months of age.
17417714:16	A third aim was to examine the short-term stability of parent-reported problem behavior and lack of competences between age 14 and 19 months.
17417714:17	To achieve these aims, we used a questionnaire with 55 items on mainly externalizing and social communication behaviors.
17417714:18	Method 
Results 
Discussion 
Recently, more interest has been paid to the manifestation of early problem behavior in infants and toddlers.
17417714:19	As expected, we found externalizing behaviors to be among the most common problem behaviors in 14-month-old infants.
17417714:20	Indeed, more than 70% of the parents reported that their children often or very often showed behavioral items such as “quickly shifts activities,” “angry moods,” and “demands must be met immediately.”
17417714:21	These rates are fairly comparable with the prevalence rates reported earlier for somewhat older children .
17417714:22	Although these and other common oppositional behaviors are symptoms of DSM-IV axis-I disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct Disorder at older ages, these high scores for 14-month-old infants are not necessarily psychopathological . Instead, the high occurrence of parent-reported problem behaviors at this early age can best be interpreted as “relatively normal” . While the symptoms and frequency of externalizing problem behaviors change with age, it is of interest to categorize these changes by their severity and to study their developmental trajectories in order to classify expected abnormal outcomes . Further work should therefore focus on longitudinal studies to decide where the cut-off point is and then start to index a risk for psychopathology.
17417714:23	Lack of competences in social communication and internalizing problem behaviors were relatively rare, occurring in about 5–9% of the community sample.
17417714:24	These results confirm that internalizing symptoms with possible underlying constructs of withdrawal and depression are less prevalent at this early age . This is not to say that these behaviors are unimportant or should be neglected.
17417714:25	For example, other social communication items such as “failure to follow with the eyes,” “does not react to calling name,” and “does not imitate simple gestures” may indicate the presence of more serious psychopathology, such as autistic spectrum disorder.
17417714:26	It would be interesting to determine whether the risk of later psychopathology is significantly higher for a combination of problem behaviors and for which combination this accounts.
17417714:27	Also, the frequency or severity of these social communication problems is associated with a serious risk of problems later in development.
17417714:28	Principal component analysis of the data for the 14-month-old children indicated that seven factors could identify important behavioral dimensions.
17417714:29	The observation that PCA revealed the same factor solutions for the original as well as for both split half samples is strong evidence for the presence of these distinct behavioral dimensions at 14 months.
17417714:30	While the CBCL 1.5–5  can detect externalizing problem behavior in 18-month-old children, our study indicates that these behaviors are present at an even younger age, 14 months.
17417714:31	The two behavioral dimensions with the highest explained variance were dimensions describing problems in oppositional behaviors and language development.
17417714:32	The dimension Language Development was correlated with the behavioral dimension Communicative Intent, which covers items of more nonverbal-related behaviors, and with Explorative Behavior.
17417714:33	Ever since the work of Piaget, explorative behavior has been considered crucial for cognitive development.
17417714:34	Explorative behavior is also an important construct in the field of attachment theory, where the infant is thought to use the attachment figure as a secure base for exploring its environment.
17417714:35	Interestingly, the finding of a separate attentional factor refers to the emergence of attentional systems of higher-level control at 12–36 months, which contribute to the development of more goal-oriented behaviors and the ability to inhibit actions . The behavioral dimension termed Inhibition consisted of items consistent with the construct of passive inhibition, namely items focusing on inhibition to novelty, separation distress, and affect-relating internalizing behaviors . Eating and sleeping problems as well as more anxiety-related problem behavior formed a Dysregulation dimension, as found in other studies . Our findings suggest that even at this young age the structures that underlie behavior problems are becoming clearer.
17417714:36	These behavioral dimensions are in line with dimensions described in other questionnaires.
17417714:37	For example, our Oppositional Behavior dimension includes many items found in the Aggressive behavior factor of the CBCL 1.5–5 . Items of the Communication scale of the Vineland are found in our dimension Language Development and Communicative Intent in our analysis.
17417714:38	The latter dimension also includes some items of the Socialization scale of the Vineland . Next, our dimension measuring Attention consists of items from Attention dimensions of other scales (the Attention Problems of the CBCL 1.5–5 and the Attention scale of the ITSEA) .
17417714:39	Also, our dimension Explorative behavior is partly in line with ITSEA’s Mastery motivation and partly with the Socialization scale of the Vineland.
17417714:40	Furthermore, our dimension Dysregulation consists mainly of items of the Internalizing dimension of the CBCL 1.5–5.
17417714:41	Finally, most of the items seen in our dimension Inhibition are found in the Other Problem dimension of the CBCL 1.5–5 and some are from the Internalizing and Competence domain of the ITSEA.
17417714:42	Inspection of the factorsumscores correlation matrix suggested two higher-order dimensions, one consisting of problems behaviors (Oppositional behavior, Attention, Dysregulation, and Inhibition) and a second one covering competences (Language Development, Explorative Behavior, and Communicative Intent).
17417714:43	This higher order division was confirmed in a factor analysis forcing a two-factor solution.
17417714:44	The two higher-order factors Total Problem Behavior and Competences correlated only very weakly with each other (0.12), suggesting a fairly amount of independence.
17417714:45	Apparently a relative high level of problem behaviors is not necessarily accompanied by a relative low level of competences and vice versa.
17417714:46	This finding is in accordance with studies using the ITSEA in older children.
17417714:47	In these studies too, competences emerged as a separate factor from factors on problem behaviors [ , ].
17417714:48	For the clinical practice our result indicates that even at a very young age, a thorough evaluation of a child’s functioning should include both an investigation of problem behaviors and an evaluation of competences.
17417714:49	With regard to sex differences, boys were reported to have significantly more problem behaviors than girls on all factors, except for dysregulation and inhibition, consistent with the finding that boys show more externalizing behaviors . We found no sex differences in dysregulation and inhibition, whereas other studies report girls to be more fearful and to have more sleeping problems than boys . Boys were reported to have more problems in social communication behaviors, which suggests that boys acquire these competencies later than girls.
17417714:50	This could play a role in the emergence of problem behavior among boys, whereas the early acquisition of competencies could be a protective factor for girls . Contradictory reports on the presence of sex differences in problem behaviors may also be due to cultural or social factors, such as social role expectancy issues, and these may well complicate the interpretation of results.
17417714:51	Problems of communicative intent, oppositional problems, and attentional problems had the highest correlations and remained moderately stable over the 5-month period between 14 and 19 months of age.
17417714:52	The least stable were inhibition and dysregulation problems, perhaps reflecting a more temporary nature of these behaviors, as reported earlier by Briggs-Gowan and Carter . At least 53% of the infants with scores within the 90th percentile of each factor sum score at 14 months still exhibited these problem behaviors at 19 months of age.
17417714:53	These results are in accordance with other studies that have also shown substantial stability in problem behavior . These studies investigated children older than 19 months of age, whereas our results suggest that these problem behaviors are already moderately stable at an even younger age, emphasizing the need for early assessment.
17417714:54	We can only speculate on the determinants of this stability, such as the child’s temperament, family environment, or parental variables.
17417714:55	It would be interesting to investigate these determinants in relation to the frequency, severity, and pervasiveness of behavior problems over a longer period of time, for example, at 14, 19, and 36 months of age, in order to gather information on how problem behavior evolves.

21687774:1	Introduction 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) (reviewed in ).
21687774:2	The aetiology of the most common forms of PD remains unknown.
21687774:3	Current therapeutic treatments comprise pharmacological strategies to compensate for dopamine deficiency or surgical interventions that reduce the hyperactivity of specific regions within the basal ganglia (reviewed in ).
21687774:4	However, dopamine replacement can lead to undesired side-effects 5–10 years after the beginning of treatment . As no treatment is available that can prevent disease progression, the search for new therapeutic interventions is intense.
21687774:5	In particular, gene therapy approaches have successfully reached the clinical trial stage in a number of cases . Approved gene therapy clinical trials are based on restoring the activity of the basal ganglia by providing growth factors, inhibiting hyperactive regions, or enhancing dopamine synthesis . 
Viral gene delivery seems to be the method of choice for gene therapy for PD due to its high efficiency for gene transduction.
21687774:6	A drawback to the delivery of genes via viral vectors comes by introducing an antigenic load into the brain.
21687774:7	These antigens will invariably elicit a transient innate immune response .
21687774:8	The nature and functional (toxic or protective) consequences of this response will vary depending on a number of variables but of utmost importance is the region of gene transfer, the viral dose used, and the state of microglial activation in that region . Importantly, the SN is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of inflammation . In addition, microglial activation during neurodegeneration in this region possesses particular features that could exacerbate disease progression if a proinflammatory stimulus hits the SN . 
This paper will focus on the properties of microglial activation in the degenerating SN in PD.
21687774:9	In addition, the immune reaction after gene delivery by adenoviral, adeno-associated, and lentiviral vectors in the CNS will be discussed.
21687774:10	Finally, a list of risk factors and parameters that could be considered when assessing the possible influence of gene transfer to the SN is presented as well as alternative approaches to circumvent inflammation-mediated toxicity.
21687774:11	2.
21687774:12	Inflammation in the Central Nervous System 
Inflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS) has different features according to (i) the region in which it occurs, (ii) the stimulus, and (iii) the molecular and cellular milieu at the time of the response.
21687774:13	For example, inflammation in the brain parenchyma is usually restricted to certain leukocyte populations, harder to initiate, and less widespread than inflammation when it occurs in the ventricles, meninges, and choroid plexus .
21687774:14	At these sites the characteristics are more reminiscent of a typical systemic inflammatory response.
21687774:15	This difference is mainly due to the absence of dendritic cells, conventional lymphatics, the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules within the CNS parenchyma, and the presence of local immunosuppressive factors (reviewed in  ).
21687774:16	In addition, the innate inflammatory response in the CNS parenchyma does not always lead to an activation of the adaptive arm of the immune system (reviewed in ).
21687774:17	By origin and function, microglial cells can be regarded as the resident macrophages of the brain and are the main innate immune cells in the CNS.
21687774:18	Microglial activation is a highly dynamic process   and involves phenotypic and reversible transitions that have been categorized into at least 4 stages according to Kreutzberg  (see ).
21687774:19	Microglial activation is a patho-physiological feature of many brain diseases and for many years its key function was thought to be solely the removal of cellular debris . Overwhelming evidence now shows that microglial activation is a phenomenon actively involved in neurodegeneration or neuroprotection (reviewed in ).
21687774:20	Despite the many differences among animal models of PD and among PD patients, a common feature found in the SN in PD is the presence of microglial activation (reviewed in  ).
21687774:21	Since the first description of microglial activation in the SN of PD brains by McGeer and colleagues in 1988 , numerous studies (more than 30) have repeated this observation in animal models and PD patients (reviewed in ).
21687774:22	Microglial-secreted factors that are associated with PD pathology include Interleukin-(IL) 1 β Tumor necrosis Factor α (TNF), IL-6, IL-2, Interferon- γ (IFN- γ ), prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (for a comprehensive review see ).
21687774:23	This is unlike astrogliosis, which is not as pronounced nor so consistently present in PD patients or animal models . Therefore, the discussion will be focused on microglial activation.
21687774:24	The role of astrocytes in PD has been recently discussed in . 
3.
21687774:25	Microglial Activation and PD-Animal Models 
In the 6-OHDA model of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, microglial activation in the SN was morphological defined as stage II and III, but not IV , see . During the neurodegenerative process, transcription but not translation of key proinflammatory cytokines, was markedly increased . In this way no proinflammatory environment was generated as a consequence of neuronal cell death.
21687774:26	Therefore, microglial activation during neurodegeneration is not associated with the production of a proinflammatory milieu, as previously presupposed .
21687774:27	This observation concurs with the physiological role of macrophages during the clearance of apoptotic cells in the periphery where such macrophage activation does not promote inflammation .
21687774:28	An example of this would be the clearance of neutrophils: it is estimated that 10 10 neutrophils/day enter apoptosis and that macrophages are responsible for removing them in humans.
21687774:29	Were this process to be proinflammatory, the human body would be permanently inflamed.
21687774:30	In PD, most if not all neuronal loss in the SN is supposed to be apoptotic  and thus, even though activated microglia are essential to remove neuronal cell debris, a proinflammatory milieu should not be expected from this activation.
21687774:31	Activated microglial cells with higher proinflammatory cytokine mRNA but not protein expression have been described as being in a “primed” state, ready to produce an outburst of proinflammatory cytokines if a second stimulus appears (see ).
21687774:32	Indeed, it has been demonstrated that if a subtoxic dose of a proinflammatory stimulus, such as bacterial endotoxin, is delivered to the degenerating SN, the translation of increased levels of mRNA coding for IL-1 takes place and an intense proinflammatory environment is generated . Interestingly, this effect can also be elicited systemically by the sustained expression of circulating IL-1 .
21687774:33	Of utmost importance was the observation that this displacement of the equilibrium towards a proinflammatory milieu in the SN exacerbated disease progression and triggered earlier and more pronounced motor signs  (see ).
21687774:34	Reversing the order of the stimuli could lead to a similar or a different observation.
21687774:35	It has been described that previous exposure to LPS rendered the animals more susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA . On the other hand, the prior inoculation of IL-1 has a neuroprotective effects on the nigral neurons . In addition, if this preexposition to inflammation was performed during pregnancy, the adult offspring were not only more susceptible to 6-OHDA administration, but had fewer dopaminergic cells in the SN at postnatal day 10 compared to controls . 
Neurons in the SN have been shown to be particularly susceptible to microglial-mediated toxicity in vitro and in vivo  , and anti-inflammatory interventions have been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of PD  . By contrast, some early work has reported neuroprotective effects of inflammatory mediators.
21687774:36	Variables such as duration and amount of expression of a specific cytokine seem to be important to anticipate the final effect of a given cytokine on neuronal viability.
21687774:37	For example, the acute injection of IL-1 β in the SN was not toxic for dopaminergic neurons in vivo if the cytokine was injected alone (10 ng or 1000 Units) or in combination with 1000 Units of TNF and 100 Units of IFN- γ in the SN . If, however, the expression of IL-1 or TNF in the SN was sustained between 14 and 21 days, it caused neuronal death, motor symptoms, and microglial activation to Stage IV  . Similarly, long-term inhibition of IL-1 or TNF attenuated loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD models  .
21687774:38	It can be concluded from these data that dosage and duration of expression are important to predict an effect of a given cytokine on neuronal viability in the SN.
21687774:39	However, some univocal effects could be defined.
21687774:40	For example, if a subtoxic inflammatory stimulus is present in the degenerating SN where “primed” microglia are present, neuronal death could be exacerbated.
21687774:41	Similarly, if the expression of IL-1 or TNF in the SN at proinflammatory levels is sustained, neuronal cell death is likely to occur.
21687774:42	4.
21687774:43	Microglial Activation and PD-Clinical Data 
As explained above, microglial activation has been found in the SN of PD patients (reviewed in ) in postmortem tissue sample and also by noninvasive imaging . In addition, higher expression levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF were found in striatal postmortem samples of PD patients  .
21687774:44	Using the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor as ligand (PK-11195) in a positron emission tomography study, neuroinflammatory processes have been verified in the pons, basal ganglia, and frontal cortex of PD patients . The resolution of this technique has not allowed an accurate study of the SN.
21687774:45	It should also be noted that evidence from PD patients indicates that microglial activation is not restricted to the SN, but it can also involve the putamen, hippocampus, brain stem, and cingulate and temporal cortex . 
5.
21687774:46	Possible Effects of Inflammation-Eliciting Gene Transfer on the Degenerating SN 
Viral gene delivery will introduce an antigenic load into the brain . These antigens will invariably elicit at least, a transient innate immune response . As stated before, in a naïve CNS, the innate immune response can be dissociated from the adaptive immune response in the brain parenchyma; for example, the systemic immune system can remain ignorant of a first antigenic challenge into the brain parenchyma.
21687774:47	However, what happens if this viral load hits a brain region in which on-going inflammation or “primed” microglial activation (as most likely will occur in the SN of PD patients) is present?
21687774:48	Several variables need to be considered to answer this complex question, including vector type, vector dosage, method of delivery, patients' age, stage of disease progression, and transgene used.
21687774:49	6.
21687774:50	How Can All These Risks Be Minimized?
21687774:51	A better understanding of the immunological component of the SN in PD patients together with studies on the possible beneficial effects of complementary anti-inflammatory treatments, changes in vector serotype, novel chemical formulations, and novel vector design will all help to design the best scenario to avoid undesired effects of an inflammatory response to gene delivery in the CNS.
21687774:52	Alternatively, taking advantage of certain intrinsic properties of viral vectors might help to circumvent the risk of inflammation in the SN.
21687774:53	For example, vectors can be used for the retrograde delivery of genes (e.g., adenoviral vectors could be administered in the striatal terminals of nigral neurons to deliver genes in the SN ).
21687774:54	Certainly, this strategy has the disadvantage that it can reduce the amount of transgene delivered to the SN as seems to be the case in the Phase II trial with AAV-neurturin . Nevertheless, it is a useful strategy to be considered when planning future gene therapy strategies using different vectors or transgenes.
21687774:55	In addition, analyzing risk factors for each treatment and patient (age, method of gene delivery, immunogenicity of vector used, immunological status of the brain area to treat, influence of the transgene to be transferred, dosage, previous exposure to the virus used as vector) will certainly reduce the risk of immune-derived toxicity during gene transfer protocols against PD.
21687774:56	In the future, this immunological risk analysis could even be used as an inclusion or exclusion criterium.
21687774:57	Unfortunately, nowadays knowledge is still lacking to define parameters with univocal effects on the immunological response of gene transfer into the SN, and technology is behind to determine the immunological status of the SN at the time of gene transfer.
21687774:58	Therefore, the most reasonable measurement is to design a clinical trial protocol to reduce the risk of inflammation-mediated toxicity as much as possible.
21687774:59	For example, we would like to propose that if a constellation of risk factors (increased age, late stage of disease, previous exposed to the virus, high viral dose) is present, an anti-inflammatory therapy could be considered . Anti-inflammatory treatments such as COX-2 inhibition, minocycline, and naloxone have promising effects on animal models of PD  . In the context of a possible inflammatory reaction in a gene therapy protocol in the SN, these anti-inflammatory treatments may be reconsidered as complementary treatments.
21687774:60	In addition, not only conventional anti-inflammatory therapies could be helpful to reduce the inflammatory risk of a PD patient, but anti-inflammatory molecules could be delivered by gene transfer in addition to other therapeutic genes.
21687774:61	In particular, the viral delivery of Interleukin-10 or IL-1ra has been shown to be neuroprotective in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD . 
7. Conclusions 
The SN is the main area of neurodegeneration in PD.
21687774:62	Microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine production have special characteristics in the degenerating SN that should not be underestimated when designing a gene transfer protocol in that area.
21687774:63	It is expected that “primed” microglia or an on-going inflammatory response will be present at the time of gene transfer in PD patients.
21687774:64	Numerous variables are in play that could change the expected outcome of gene delivery.
21687774:65	An exhaustive analysis of the status of risks factors known to lead to inflammation at the moment of clinical intervention, leading to complementary anti-inflammatory treatments and/or alternative gene delivery strategies or additional genes delivered (e.g., IL-10) is proposed to reduce undesired, inflammation-driven side effects.
21687774:66	Gene therapy against PD has reached maturity with eight clinical trials approved.
21687774:67	It is of importance to consider, with the limitations of the available technology and knowledge, all variables affecting the immunological status of the PD patient and the possible interactions with the inflammatory component of gene delivery.
21687774:68	This analysis should increase the probability of providing safe gene transfer in the SN and reduce inflammation-biased results that can obscure the efficacy of a given gene transfer protocol.
16792798:0	Background 
In 2000 the UK Medical Research Council published a structure for evaluating complex interventions, which proposed that interventions should be modelled and then tested prior to a full-scale trial . The pre-trial work could be expected to provide a more realistic estimate of the likely effect of the intervention and inform decisions regarding intervention design and delivery.
16792798:1	In principle, such work may help to avoid wasting resources evaluating ineffective interventions because rigorous development and testing will reject poor interventions and unfeasible trials before they reach full-scale evaluation . 
The aim of the current study was twofold.
16792798:2	Firstly, we wanted to survey the estimates of treatment effect and recruitment given in trial reports and compare them with those actually achieved, together with any mention of piloting or testing.
16792798:3	Secondly, we wanted to ask the authors of these trial reports whether testing did influence the design of their trials and whether more or different testing would have led to a different intervention being developed.
16792798:4	This paper deals with the second of these; the first is covered in a sister paper . 
Methods 
We searched the 2004 issues of the British Journal of General Practice (BJGP), the BMJ, Family Practice, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA), the Journal of Health Services Research and Policy (JHSRP) and the Lancet for articles indexed in Pubmed as 'randomized controlled trials'.
16792798:5	We did this by using Pubmed's 'Limits' facility to restrict the type of article retrieved to randomized controlled trials.
16792798:6	These journals were selected because they are high impact journals with a history (in our experience) of publishing reports of randomised controlled trials.
16792798:7	We limited ourselves to these seven journals because we thought it would be unwise to commit resources to a systematic review without having a much better idea of the type and extent of pre-trial testing done in complex intervention studies.
16792798:8	The current study can be seen as a pilot that can inform the development of a search strategy, inclusion criteria and selection of outcome measures for a larger systematic study.
16792798:9	We had two further inclusion criteria: 
• the intervention must be complex 
• trials must address patient care or provision of care by health professionals 
To select complex intervention trials we used the MRC definition of a complex trial: ' Complex interventions in health care, whether therapeutic or preventative, comprise a number of separate elements which seem essential to the proper functioning of the intervention although the active ingredient of the intervention that is effective is difficult to specify . ' .
16792798:10	This definition is open to interpretation.
16792798:11	Interventions that we considered complex under this definition included the use of volunteer counsellors to increase breast-feeding, a behavioural intervention to reduce acquisition of HIV among homosexual men and the use of a structured shared care model involving education, a nurse specialist, locally agreed treatment protocols and improved primary care-secondary care communication to improve the management of diabetes in primary care.
16792798:12	Interventions that we did not consider complex included a comparison of five antimicrobial regimens for mild to moderate facial acne, a study of a computerised guideline system that measured physician knowledge but not the care provided, using an invitation to ultrasound screening to reduce mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm and adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting in the treatment of mild symptoms of throat infections or adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
16792798:13	These and similar interventions were excluded because they involved a single component where the active ingredient was clear or because they did not involve patient care.
16792798:14	Abstracts were scanned for relevance by both authors and relevant abstracts were discussed and any disagreements resolved.
16792798:15	The full text of included studies was obtained and ST did data extraction.
16792798:16	Of the 318 articles identified by our search, 70 met our inclusion criteria (28 from the BMJ, 17 from JAMA, ten from the Lancet, eight from Family Practice, seven from BJGP and none from both JAMIA and JHSRP.
16792798:17	A five-question email questionnaire was sent to the corresponding author of each of the 70 included studies.
16792798:18	The questionnaire was piloted on colleagues prior to its use in the survey although no changes to the questionnaire's wording or general design were suggested.
16792798:19	A full copy of the questionnaire is given in the Appendix.
16792798:20	The email sent to authors also assured them that they would remain anonymous in any future publications.
16792798:21	A single reminder was sent one week after the initial email.
16792798:22	Results 
One email was incorrect and an alternative address could not be found; 72% (50/69) of the remaining authors replied but eight of these did not consider their interventions to be complex.
16792798:23	The results presented below come from the responses of the remaining 42 authors.
16792798:24	The majority of interventions were tested (34/42 or 81%; 95% confidence interval = 67% to 90%), some extensively (Table ).
16792798:25	Conversely, only 17 (or 50%; 95% Cl = 34% to 66%) of the 34 trials that involved testing actually mention this testing in the published report.
16792798:26	Those not mentioning their testing included some studies that ran substantial testing programs prior to the intervention's evaluation in a full-scale trial.
16792798:27	Of the 34 respondents who said their interventions were tested, 22 (or 65%; 95% Cl = 48% to 79%) did not believe that different or further testing would have produced a more effective intervention.
16792798:28	Four of those who did no testing thought that more testing would have improved their intervention.
16792798:29	The 13 respondents who did believe further testing would have led to improvements gave the following reasons: better intervention (five respondents); better delivery (two); better intervention and delivery (two); more understanding of how intervention components work (one); and unspecified (three).
16792798:30	Five respondents mentioned a lack of funding as a reason for not doing more testing.
16792798:31	Table presents some illustrative comments from these 13 respondents; almost all those saying that different or further testing would not have produced a more effective intervention simply replied 'No'.
16792798:32	The testing that was done influenced the interventions in a variety of ways.
16792798:33	Some of the testing would be relevant for any intervention trial (eg.
16792798:34	testing of data collection instruments or training manuals) and not just those involving a complex intervention.
16792798:35	Reported testing could be categorised as: iterative refinements of the intervention and/or its delivery (20 respondents; altered the trial design (three); altered both intervention and trial design (three); confirmed the feasibility of the trial (three); changed nothing (two); and unclear what influence testing had (three).
16792798:36	Where trial design was changed, pre-trial testing led to an arm of the trial being dropped in three cases.
16792798:37	Examples of how testing influenced the full-scale trial are given in Table . The type of information we received from respondents is very close to the short statement format given in Table . 
Discussion 
Most of the complex interventions evaluated by the 42 respondents were tested to some extent but this work does not always find its way into published trial reports, which leads to an incomplete description of the rationale for intervention choice.
16792798:38	There were no clear differences between the trials of responders and non-responders although only five of the 19 non-responders (or 26%) mentioned testing in the trial report, which is about two-thirds the rate of responders (40%).
16792798:39	It is possible that complex interventions are tested somewhat less than our results suggest because of responder bias although we have no way of knowing this.
16792798:40	However, we believe that such a bias, if it exists, will reduce but not reverse our main finding: that most complex interventions are tested but that this testing is often not reported.
16792798:41	For responders, even extensive development work involving randomised controlled trials or multi-site pilots running for many weeks can fail to be mentioned in the trial report.
16792798:42	This can be due to space restrictions imposed by journals (several respondents cited this problem), or a belief that early development work is unlikely to be considered interesting enough for journals to publish.
16792798:43	This is a shame since without this information it may not be possible to judge whether a trial result could be improved with a better intervention, whether the intervention and its delivery are already optimal, or whether further work with a different intervention is required.
16792798:44	When there is testing, it is no surprise that this generally leads to changes to the intervention and/or its delivery.
16792798:45	Testing can also lead to substantial changes to trial design.
16792798:46	A minority of trialists neither tested their interventions nor believed that more testing would have been beneficial.
16792798:47	Most trialists do some testing and even modest testing lasting a few weeks can refine an intervention and its delivery.
16792798:48	If funders were more receptive to supporting, or even insisted upon, comprehensive pre-trial testing it is reasonable to believe that fewer suboptimal complex interventions would enter full-scale trials.
16792798:49	The importance of publishing this pre-trial development work should also be acknowledged and supported by journal editors, perhaps in the electronic versions of their journals . 
Conclusion 
Complex interventions are generally tested prior to their evaluation in a full-scale trial, although the amount of testing varies.
16792798:50	Testing is often not described in trial reports, which makes it hard to judge whether a trial result could be improved with a better intervention, or whether further work with a different intervention is required.

16792798:56	Study title: [Title] 
Question 1: Was your intervention complex?
16792798:57	The Medical Research Council uses the following definition of a complex intervention [Medical Research Council.
16792798:58	A framework for development and evaluation of RCTs for complex interventions to improve health.
16792798:59	April 2000.]: 
'Complex interventions in health care, whether therapeutic or preventative, comprise a number of separate elements which seem essential to the proper functioning of the intervention although the active ingredient of the intervention that is effective is difficult to specify.'

20442827:0	INTRODUCTION 
People are predisposed to various diseases based on their way of living and occupational habits.
20442827:1	They are preventable, and can be lowered with changes in diet, lifestyle, and environment.
20442827:2	Lifestyle diseases characterize those diseases whose occurrence is primarily based on daily habits of people and are a result of an inappropriate relationship of people with their environment.
20442827:3	The onset of these lifestyle diseases is insidious, they take years to develop, and once encountered do not lend themselves easily to cure.
20442827:4	The main factors contributing to the lifestyle diseases include bad food habits, physical inactivity, wrong body posture, and disturbed biological clock.
20442827:5	The diet [or lifestyle] of different populations might partly determine their rates of cancer, and the basis for this hypothesis was strengthened by results of studies showing that people who migrate from one country to another generally acquire the cancer rates of the new host country, suggesting that environmental [or lifestyle factors] rather than genetic factors are the key determinants of the international variation in cancer rates.
20442827:6	A report, jointly prepared by the World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum, says India will incur an accumulated loss of $236.6 billion by 2015 on account of unhealthy lifestyles and faulty diet.
20442827:7	The resultant chronic diseases - heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and respiratory infections - which are ailments of long duration and slow progression, will severely affect people's earnings.
20442827:8	The income loss to Indians because of these diseases, which was $8.7 billion in 2005, is projected to rise to $54 billion in 2015.
20442827:9	Pakistan woul d face an accumulated loss of $30.7 billion with income loss increasing by $5.5 billion to $6.7 billion by 2015.
20442827:10	China, however, will be worse off.
20442827:11	While its accumulated loss will stand at $557.7 billion, the loss of income of the Chinese will stand at $131.8 billion, almost eight times what it was in 2005.
20442827:12	According to the report, 60% of all deaths worldwide in 2005 (35 million) resulted from noncommunicable diseases and accounted for 44% of premature deaths.
20442827:13	What's worse, around 80% of these deaths will occur in low and middle-income countries like India which are also crippled by an ever increasing burden of infectious diseases, poor maternal and perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies.
20442827:14	Almost half of those who die from chronic diseases will be in their productive years.
20442827:15	The report also points to the fact that countries like Brazil, China, Russia and India currently lose more than 20 million productive life-years annually to chronic diseases.
20442827:16	And the number is expected to grow by 65% by 2030.
20442827:17	In 2007, nearly 3.1 billion people were economically active.
20442827:18	The figure is estimated to exceed 3.6 billion in 2020.
20442827:19	The cost to employers of morbidity attributed to non-communicable diseases is increasingly rapidly.
20442827:20	Workplaces should make possible healthy food choices and support physical activity.
20442827:21	Unhealthy diets and excessive energy intake, physical inactivity and tobacco use are major risk factors for non-communicable diseases, the report said.
20442827:22	According to a survey conducted by the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM), 68% of working women in the age bracket of 21-52 years were found to be afflicted with lifestyle ailments such as obesity, depression, chronic backache, diabetes and hypertension.
20442827:23	The study ‘Preventive Healthcare and Corporate Female Workforce’ also said that long hours and working under strict deadlines cause up to 75% of working women to suffer from depression or general anxiety disorder, compared to women with lesser levels of psychological demand at work.
20442827:24	Women employed in sectors that demand more time such as media, knowledge process outsourcing and touring jobs are unable to take leave when unwell, and force themselves to work mainly due to job insecurity, especially during the current financial meltdown, the report said.
20442827:25	However, it said, factors such exposure to industrial pollutants and environmental toxins, poor quality of sleep, lack of exercise, sunlight exposure, poor nutrition, excessive intake of alcohol etc might play a confounding role and are the priority areas for further research.
20442827:26	Highlighting the fact that women play vital and multiple roles, especially those employed, the report stressed on the need for a balance at home and workplace.
20442827:27	“Ignorance of healthcare can have multiple implications on her surrounding environment such as her family, workplace and social network,” said the study.
20442827:28	Over 77% of respondents said they avoided routine check-ups,” the report stated, indicating that the hectic schedule of balancing workplace and home, along with balancing between social and personal requirements lead to women ignoring their health.
20442827:29	The report further stated that 47% of respondents spent less than Rs.
20442827:30	500 on healthcare in a year, while 22% spent in the range of Rs.
20442827:31	500-Rs.
20442827:32	5,000 as they suffered ailments such as obesity, depression and spondylosis.
20442827:33	Over 29% respondents were found to be spending between Rs. 5,000-50,000 on healthcare annually.
20442827:34	However, most of these respondents were found to be afflicted with high or low blood pressure, diabetes, heart diseases, asthma, urinary infection and arthritis.
20442827:35	The study cited scientific evidence that healthy diet and adequate physical activity, at least 30 minutes of moderate activity at least five days a week, helped prevent NCDs.
20442827:36	In India, 10% of adults suffer from hypertension while the country is home to 25-30 million diabetics.
20442827:37	Three out of every 1,000 people suffer a stroke.
20442827:38	The number of deaths due to heart attack is projected to increase from 1.2 million to 2 million in 2010.
20442827:39	DISCUSSION 
According to a research paper published in the prestigious Lancet there is corroborative evidence that diet and lifestyle is playing a major role in predisposition to various diseases like cancer.
20442827:40	In many countries, peoples' diet changed substantially in the second half of the twentieth century with increase in consumption of meat, dairy products, vegetable oils, fruit juice, and alcoholic beverages, and decrease in consumption of starchy staple foods such as bread, potatoes, rice, and maize flour.
20442827:41	Other aspects of lifestyle also changed, notably, large reductions in physical activity and prevalence of obesity.
20442827:42	In the 1970s it was noted that people in many western countries had diets high in animal products, fat, and sugar, and high rates of cancer of the colorectum, breast, prostate, endometrium, and lung; by contrast, individuals in developing countries usually had diet which were based on one or two starchy staple foods, with low intakes of animal products, fat, and sugar, and low rates of these cancers.
20442827:43	These observations suggest that the diet [or lifestyle] of different populations might partly determine their rates of cancer, and the basis for this hypothesis was strengthened by results of studies showing that people who migrate from one country to another generally acquire the cancer rates of the new host country, suggesting that environmental [or lifestyle factors] rather than genetic factors are the key determinants of the international variation in cancer rates.
20442827:44	With advancement of our lifestyle we have become dependent on technology and gadgets which directly have an impact on our health.
20442827:45	In a study conducted by Dr.
20442827:46	Masayuki Tatemichi, Toho University School of Medicine, heavy computer use could be linked to glaucoma, especially among those who are short-sighted.
20442827:47	Glaucoma is caused by increased fluid pressure within the eye compressing the nerves at the back, which can lead to blindness if not treated.
20442827:48	Workers classified as heavy computer users were more likely to be long-sighted (hypermetropia) or short-sighted (myopia).
20442827:49	Around a third (165) of these workers had suspected glaucoma.
20442827:50	Upon further analysis, heavy computer use, suspected glaucoma and short-sightedness appeared to be interlinked.
20442827:51	Regular spending of lot of time in front of computer may lead to neck and back pain because body is going to begin to change and adapt to take on this frequent activity.
20442827:52	The front neck muscles will slowly grow shorter and tighter, while the muscles in the back of the neck will grow longer and weaker.
20442827:53	The stiffening of neck also is a common problem along with headache, fatigue and exhaustion.
20442827:54	Wrong sitting or standing posture while working gives strain to the backbone and gives a chronic back pain.
20442827:55	The heat generated by laptops kept on the lap of males cause decrease in sperm count.
20442827:56	Other extensively used gadget is mobile phone which is supposed to be a culprit for a number of diseases and ailments, although its adverse effects on humans are yet to be established and validated.
20442827:57	Research conducted on animals in different countries has established a number of adverse effects of mobile phone radiation like low fertility, reduction in attention and memory, increase in reaction time, leakage in blood-brain barrier, sleep disturbances, headache, ringing in the ears, hearing disturbances etc.
20442827:58	People working in night shifts witness a disturbed biological clock leading to insomnia, indigestion, acidity, loss of appetite, headache, irritability, hypertension, mood fluctuations and body pain.
20442827:59	Those having late night parties also experience the same with some additional effects of untimely munching, drinking and smoking.
20442827:60	Alteration in the circadian rhythm of a person compromises his immunity, further leading to various opportunistic diseases.
20442827:61	Traffic on the Indian roads is also responsible for many common ailments for frequent travelers or those who earn their living by driving.
20442827:62	According to the research study bad public transportation and faulty office postures rides for quite a long time can lead to a chronic back pain.
20442827:63	Research also shows that most of the (41%) people suffering from backache are users of public transport and spend two to five hours in front of the computers in Delhi.
20442827:64	Bumpy ride shakes our body too much and the impact generated is so high that it damages the vertebra with time.
20442827:65	It may cause spinal cord injury, which is still incurable.
20442827:66	Many people develop spondylolysis, which generally occurs due to breaking down (dissolution) of a part of vertebra, leading to localized back pain.
20442827:67	People dealing with huge weights are predisposed to slip disk and sciatica.
20442827:68	Occupational lifestyle diseases include those caused by the factors present in the vicinity like heat, sound, dust, fumes, smoke, cold, and other pollutants.
20442827:69	These factors are responsible for allergy, respiratory and hearing problems, and heat or cold shock.
20442827:70	Those occupations, in which there is a huge temperature or pressure difference, cause a disturbed homeostasis leading to disease.
20442827:71	Astronauts and divers have to spend time in a closed box to minimize the risk developed by the pressure difference.
20442827:72	Similarly people working in high temperatures face problems related to BP, metabolism, and organ failure due to shock.
20442827:73	Extreme cold working condition causes hypothermia and shock.
20442827:74	People in the fishing or shipping industry face seasickness or motion sickness along with other risk factors contributing to a diseased condition.
20442827:75	All the contributing factors have significant effect on various diseases alone as well as in combination with other factors.
20442827:76	Some of the common diseases encountered because of occupational lifestyle are Alzheimer's disease, arteriosclerosis, cancer, chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, nephritis/CRF, and stroke.
20442827:77	A studyconducted on students from government and public schools in Delhi from November 2005 showed that 26% of the kids aged 14-17 years had Syndrome X (caused by obesity), a precursor to diabetes; 1,168 students from 15 schools were screened - obesity was found to be the major cause of other problems.
20442827:78	Children who grow up to be obese could suffer from diabetes, stroke, liver diseases, infertility, hypertension, arthritis and cancer.
20442827:79	Obese children also have a high risk of development of early heart diseases since 13-25% of them showed high levels of C-reactive protein, 40-50% had increased triglycerides (blood fat) levels and 30-70% had low HDL (good cholesterol) levels.
20442827:80	In the screening, it was found that the level of obesity was higher in public school students than the government school students.
20442827:81	Twenty eight per cent of urban children had Syndrome X, one step away from diabetes and two steps away from heart disease and junk food aggravates the problem.
20442827:82	The results show an alarming trend of obesity and related diseases.
20442827:83	CONCLUSIONS 
The western lifestyle, characterized by convenience food, TV and PCs, is taking its toll on children as well as adults, and is producing increased numbers of overweight, passive youngsters with lifestyle diseases.
20442827:84	Kids spending too much time slouched in front of the TV or PCs, should be encouraged to find a physical sport or activity they enjoy.
20442827:85	Fun exercises should be encouraged into family outings.
20442827:86	A pizza-and-video evening should be replaced for a hike and picnic.
20442827:87	Kids who do participate in sport, especially at a high competitive level, can find the pressure to succeed very stressful.
20442827:88	It's important that parents watch out for signs of psychological strain, as well as physical fatigue from overtraining.
20442827:89	Young athletes also have specific nutritional needs that require extra attention.
20442827:90	A diet of only junk food, overeating and lack of physical activity are not only responsible for diseases related to nutrition, but also anorexia nervosa, which involves many people starving themselves for maintaining their figure.
20442827:91	This type of disease is more prevalent in the fashion and showbiz industry.
20442827:92	A healthy lifestyle must be adopted to combat these diseases with a proper balanced diet, physical activity and by giving due respect to biological clock.
20442827:93	To decrease the ailments caused by occupational postures, one should avoid long sitting hours and should take frequent breaks for stretching or for other works involving physical movements.
20442827:94	An ergonomic chair should be designed based on the human contour to fit the right sitting posture so that the uneven pressure on joints and muscles may be minimized.
20442827:95	In this revolutionized era we cannot stop doing the developmental work, but we can certainly reduce our ailments by incorporating these simple and effective measures to our lives.
19468448:0	INTRODUCTION 
Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy is an alternative to open surgery for removing large stones not amenable to endoscopic treatment.
19468448:1	In most of the published literature, laparoscopic approach for lower ureteric stone is described to be less successful than middle and upper ureter.
19468448:2	Upper and mid ureteric stones are safely approached retroperitoneally but lower ureteric stones are better approached transperitoneally.
19468448:3	This article describes important technical points to successfully retrieve large lower ureteric stones through transperitoneal laparoscopy.
19468448:4	TECHNIQUE 
Two patients with lower ureteric stone of size of 3 cm and 2.8 cm were primarily treated with laparoscopy.
19468448:5	Both the affected units had good renal function on intravenous urogram . 
DISCUSSION 
Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy is a minimally invasive option to treat large ureteric stones not amenable to ureteroscopy.
19468448:6	There are a very few small case series describing laparoscopic ureterolithotomy for lower ureteric stone.
19468448:7	Though the mid and upper ureteric stones which are too large to be retrieved ureteroscopically, are safe to remove retroperitoneally, lower ureteric stones are little demanding due to its complex location in the pelvis.
19468448:8	In one study, iliac retroperitoneal approach has been described for stones below ischial spine.
19468448:9	In that study, reflection of peritoneum over the iliac vessels and inflamed ureter below the sacroiliac joint was found to be difficult so there were only 2 cases done out of total 101 patients.
19468448:10	Transperitoneal approach gives better understanding of the anatomical landmarks particularly for the lower ureteric stone.
19468448:11	Port placement is the most crucial part of any laparoscopic surgery, more so for approaching lower ureteric stones located below the Sacroiliac joint (SI).
19468448:12	As per the protocol, we at our institute adopted an open technique for placement of the camera port in all our laparoscopic surgeries.
19468448:13	It is easy to enter the abdomen at the umbilicus as only rectus sheath is encountered.
19468448:14	Most of the laparoscopic surgeon, wittingly or unwittingly follow a strategy of diamond shape configuration for port placement where the target area lies in the center.
19468448:15	Surface marking for lower ureteric stone helped in exact placement of dominant and assistant ports.
19468448:16	It is always better to dissect the ureter proximal to the site of the stone as it is free from periureteral inflammation and fibrosis.
19468448:17	Most of the time, the stone is impacted due to surrounding inflammation and does not move with manipulation but secondary stones proximal to it may move proximally due to manipulation of the ureter.
19468448:18	Therefore, as soon as ureter is identified at the iliac vessels it should be double looped with vascular tape and then dissection should be carried out distally.
19468448:19	Stone localization is an important step of this surgery.
19468448:20	In case, when the ureter is not so dilated, stone could be seen bulging in the ureter but in cases where stone is not seen prominently due to proximal dilatation of the ureter, it would sometimes become difficult to localize the stone visually.
19468448:21	Pinching with the Maryland forceps helps in localizing the stone.
19468448:22	Fluoroscopic localization would help if one is not sure about it but in both these cases stone could be localized by pinching technique.
19468448:23	Similarly while making ureterotomy with electrocautery; it did not require fixing of stone in one position as done while using cold knife and it also gave better hemostasis.
19468448:24	It has been shown that using diathermy to make ureteral incision does not affect the ureteric tissue healing adversely.
19468448:25	Once the stone is fished out, it should be bagged.
19468448:26	In retroperitoneal surgery for upper ureteric stones, where cup forceps have been described to pull the stone along with the port, wherein even if a stone slips out then due to limited space in the retro peritoneum it could be retrieved again.
19468448:27	Unlike in retroperitoneal approach it is always better to bag the stone to avoid the risk of losing it in the peritoneal cavity.
19468448:28	In large stones with presence of inflammation it is always better to place a double J stent that is put in before or during the laparoscopy to avoid the complication of urinary extravasation and urinoma formation.
19468448:29	Many a times due to impaction and inflammation, it is not possible to place a double J stent cystoscopically despite using various manoeuvres and ureteroscopic guidance.
19468448:30	If double J stent could be placed laparoscopically after the removal of stone then it not only saves significant anaesthesia time but also operating room resources.
19468448:31	Laparoscopic stenting after ureterolithotomy has been described with a custom made stent where both the ends are closed with a guide wire protruding out in the middle forming a loop.
19468448:32	Disadvantage of this is that the site of loop does not correspond to the site of the stone and stent requires to be manufactured as an additional thing whereas in current technique the routinely available stent could be used.
19468448:33	In both the cases stent could be placed safely.
19468448:34	CONCLUSIONS 
With modified technique of laparoscopic stenting and ureteral pinching and port placement strategy, lower ureteric stones could be well treated with transperitoneal laparoscopic approach.

15562316:0	Introduction 
A hallmark of pathogens is their ability to manipulate their hosts at both a cellular and organismal level.
15562316:1	This exploitation of the host can involve the production of specific toxins, secretion of virulence effectors into host cells via type III and type IV secretion apparatuses, or mimicry of host signaling molecules ( ; ).
15562316:2	The host organism can combat the infection with an array of innate and adaptive immune responses.
15562316:3	Because there are so many possible combinations of thrusts, feints, and parries, there are many potential outcomes to this battle, ranging from a simple skirmish to defeat for one or the other of the combatants.
15562316:4	As a result, microbes can produce acute and virulent infections in diseases such as cholera or plague or can take a path to cause persistent infections as in tuberculosis, Lyme disease, or host-adapted salmonellosis.
15562316:5	It is important to understand which bacterial and host factors determine whether a microbe will cause epidemic disease, be a brief nuisance infection, or become a commensal.
15562316:6	serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is naturally infectious to mice through an oral route and causes a systemic disease resembling human typhoid fever.
15562316:7	crosses the gut epithelium by entering and then killing M cells of the Peyer's patch.
15562316:8	Once across the epithelial barrier, Salmonella infect macrophages and spread to the mesenteric lymph nodes and subsequently to other organs.
15562316:9	has two type III secretory apparatuses (TTSAs) that translocate effector proteins across both bacterial and host membranes into the host cell cytoplasm.
15562316:10	One TTSA encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) plays an important role in cell entry, whereas a second TTSA, SPI2, alters the intracellular environment of the host cell to permit Salmonella growth.
15562316:11	Salmonella likely does not find itself in the hemolymph of Drosophila in nature, but by placing it there we can ask some questions that are difficult to approach using other techniques.
15562316:12	The fly is able to fight invading microorganisms via an innate immune response that is composed of at least three arms.
15562316:13	First, there is an inducible humoral immune response, which involves the secretion of antimicrobial peptides by a liver-like organ called the fat body.
15562316:14	Second, there is a melanization response that exposes microbes to reactive oxygen as melanin is deposited on the invader.
15562316:15	Third, there is the cellular immune response, which can result in the phagocytosis of relatively small organisms like bacteria or the encapsulation of larger parasites such as nematodes or parasitoid wasp eggs.
15562316:16	The humoral immune functions are currently the most thoroughly characterized part of the fly's immune system.
15562316:17	This aspect of the immune response is triggered when microbial molecules are recognized by fly pattern recognition receptors and signals are transmitted through the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways to activate three nuclear factor κB-like transcription factors, dorsal, Dorsal-related immunity factor, and Relish.
15562316:18	It was work in this area that led to the discovery of Toll's central role in vertebrate immune recognition.
15562316:19	Little is known about how Drosophila phagocytes affect the course of infections.
15562316:20	It has been demonstrated that these cells act in concert with the humoral immune response to destroy invading bacteria ( ; ), and it is well established that they are involved in the encapsulation of parasites.
15562316:21	A potential phagocytic receptor for gram-negative bacteria as well as molecules involved in phagocytosis in cultured Drosophila cells have been identified.
15562316:22	Still, we have much to learn about how the phagocytes find and phagocytose microbes, kill microbes, or send signals to the body to indicate that an infection is in progress.
15562316:23	To focus attention on the cellular immune response, we have been characterizing the interaction between Drosophila phagocytes and pathogens that are specialized at growing within phagocytes.
15562316:24	These bacteria have evolved methods of defeating phagocytes.
15562316:25	By using a combination of wild-type and mutant bacteria, we can probe the function of the Drosophila phagocyte.
15562316:26	We have shown previously that the two intracellular pathogens and can infect Drosophila phagocytes, and that some of the pathogenesis mechanisms developed by these bacteria for use in vertebrate phagocytes also function in the fly ( ; ).
15562316:27	In this work we chose to study because of its well-characterized secreted effector proteins.
15562316:28	We found that the mutation of effectors led to increased fly survival but, paradoxically, also increased bacterial survival.
15562316:29	We propose a model that suggests the immune response of the fly can be deleterious to its health.
15562316:30	This model predicts that the fly produces damaging immune effectors.
15562316:31	We show that the fly homolog of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), encoded by the eiger gene, is involved in this process.
15562316:32	Flies homozygous for mutations in eiger outlive wild-type flies infected with Salmonella . 
Results/Discussion 
We attempted to infect Drosophila with by feeding bacteria to flies and by injecting bacteria into the hemocoel.
15562316:33	Flies were resistant to feeding (unpublished data), but direct injection of approximately 10,000 bacterial cells resulted in an infection that caused death in 7–9 d, while injection of sterile medium led to a mean time of death of approximately 20 d ( A).
15562316:34	The most thoroughly characterized immune response in the fly is the humoral immune response, which involves the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemocoel by an organ called the fat body.
15562316:35	Two highly conserved signaling systems, the Toll and IMD pathways, have been shown to control the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide genes.
15562316:36	The IMD pathway is implicated in raising a response to gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella . Flies homozygous for an imd mutation succumbed to Salmonella infections rapidly, dying within 12 h of infection ( B).
15562316:37	Bacterial numbers exceeded 100,000,000 per fly as the flies died ( C), and Salmonella in dying flies were found circulating in the hemolymph (unpublished data).
15562316:38	Circulating bacteria were not seen in wild-type flies.
15562316:39	In contrast to imd homozygotes, flies homozygous for a mutation in Dif, a transcription factor in the Toll pathway, did not die rapidly ( B and C).
15562316:40	This experiment shows that mutations in the IMD but not the Toll pathway sensitize the fly to Salmonella . Further, these results suggest that the fly's humoral immune response limits the growth of free Salmonella in the hemocoel.
15562316:41	In mammals and birds, is largely an intracellular pathogen.
15562316:42	To determine whether was indeed growing in a protected intracellular niche in the fly, we measured the in vivo sensitivity of Salmonella to gentamicin, an antibiotic that does not cross host-cell plasma membranes.
15562316:43	To determine whether gentamicin could kill in flies, 50 nl of 1 mg/ml gentamicin was injected into flies to load them with the drug.
15562316:44	was injected into the flies 15 min later and incubated for 4 h to allow the antibiotic time to act.
15562316:45	Flies were homogenized and plated on selective medium to determine Salmonella colony forming units (cfu) ( D).
15562316:46	Under these conditions, bacterial loads were 100-fold lower in antibiotic-injected flies than control flies, showing that the antibiotic could kill Salmonella immediately following injection.
15562316:47	To determine whether in an established infection were protected from gentamicin killing, we injected flies that had been infected with for 7 d with gentamicin or water, and incubated the flies for 4 h before homogenizing and plating them.
15562316:48	The day 7 time point was chosen throughout this paper, as it is the latest time point we can use before most flies begin to die from the infection.
15562316:49	This experiment showed that bacteria that had been in the fly for 7 d were protected from the antibiotic and suggests that the bacteria were located in an intracellular location.
15562316:50	In other bacterial infection models in the fly, death of the host occurs only when bacterial numbers increase beyond 10 6 bacteria per fly.
15562316:51	This is the case for infections both of wild-type flies with pathogens such as and ( ; ; ) and of mutant flies with nonpathogenic bacteria such as ( ; ).
15562316:52	This is not the case for Salmonella in a wild-type fly.
15562316:53	To determine the growth characteristics of in Drosophila bacteria were injected over a 1,000-fold dilution range; 7 d after infection, flies were homogenized and plated.
15562316:54	At this time, bacteria were found to cover only a 5-fold range ( E).
15562316:55	Bacteria injected at low densities grew to levels between 10,000 and 100,000 bacteria per fly, but those injected at higher levels did not pass this threshold.
15562316:56	This final number is at least 1,000 fold lower than the number of bacteria found during fatal and infections in the fly.
15562316:57	Salmonella thus reaches a population ceiling in flies, and the flies die containing relatively small numbers of bacteria.
15562316:58	To determine the location of bacteria within the fly, we examined flies infected with expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP).
15562316:59	Bacteria carrying the plasmid containing the macrophage-inducible gene (pmig-1), which induces GFP expression upon entry into the phagosome, or the strain smo22, which constitutively expresses GFP (unpublished data), were injected into larvae and flies.
15562316:60	GFP-expressing could be seen within hemocytes bled from infected larvae ( A– D).
15562316:61	Hemocytes in adults are mostly sessile and cannot be easily removed from the fly.
15562316:62	However, these cells can be observed through the cuticle, and clusters of these cells are found on the dorsal surface of the abdomen, along the dorsal vessel ( ; ).
15562316:63	Salmonella were found associated with these cells ( E– H).
15562316:64	The distribution of bacteria seen using the two GFP constructs was similar (unpublished data).
15562316:65	This experiment suggests that, similar to the situation in mice, Salmonella are found within phagocytes.
15562316:66	Furthermore, the Salmonella in fly hemocytes induced the expression of GFP from a Salmonella promoter normally induced upon phagocytosis by a mouse macrophage.
15562316:67	This demonstrates that an infection-related gene is induced even when the bacteria are infecting an animal at 29 °C instead of 37 °C.
15562316:68	carrying mutations in a gene encoding a regulator of virulence, phosphatase P (phoP), or blocking the function of either SPI1 (orgA::Tn10) or SPI2 (ssrA::miniTn5), were injected into flies.
15562316:69	All of these mutants killed flies more slowly than wild-type bacteria ( A, graph area “i”).
15562316:70	However, analysis of bacterial growth within infected flies revealed a more complicated story.
15562316:71	PhoP mutants produced infections that were less lethal than wild-type Salmonella, but the infecting bacteria grew to the same levels seen in wild-type infections ( B).
15562316:72	In contrast, a SPI1 or SPI2 mutant caused little death, and the bacteria grew to an average of 149,000 cfu/fly ( SPI2 mutants) instead of the average of 40,000 cfu per fly found in wild-type infections ( D and B).
15562316:73	Thus, the level of bacterial growth of this mutant is almost 4-fold higher than for wild-type Salmonella . This suggests that if cannot manipulate Drosophila cells by secreting effectors, the survival of both pathogen and host is dramatically improved.
15562316:74	To determine which of the known TTSA effector proteins contributed to this phenotype, flies were injected with Salmonella carrying in-frame deletions of these genes as well as several others we suspected might be involved in virulence in the fly ( A).
15562316:75	Deletions of spiC, Salmonella secreted effector A (sseA), sseB, sseC, and sseD all resembled a SPI2 knockout as expected because the proteins encoded by these genes are implicated in building the SPI2 translocation machinery ( ; ; ; ).
15562316:76	Deletion of the gene encoding the Salmonella leucine-rich repeat-containing protein (PSlrP) produced a phenotype similar to that of the knockout of the entire SPI2 TTSA in terms of fly death ( A, graph area “ii”).
15562316:77	Wild-type virulence could be restored to the slrP mutant by expressing slrP, controlled by its native promoter, in trans on a single-copy plasmid, p. slrP ( A, graph area “ii”).
15562316:78	Because SPI1 and SPI2 bacteria accumulate to higher levels than wild-type strains, in the fruit fly, we measured growth of slrP- knockout bacteria.
15562316:79	Mutation of slrP did not significantly alter the growth of Salmonella ( B).
15562316:80	These experiments suggest that slrP is a determinant of Salmonella virulence in the fruit fly, but that mutation of slrP alone is not sufficient to alter Salmonella growth.
15562316:81	The protein encoded by slrP is suspected to be a specific effector translocated directly into the host cytoplasm.
15562316:82	Its function there remains unknown ( ; ; ).
15562316:83	The results we obtain during fly infection differ from what is found in mammalian and avian hosts.
15562316:84	SPI1 is required by Salmonella for breaching the gut barrier but is dispensable if the bacteria are introduced systemically by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.
15562316:85	Both phoP- and SPI2 -mutant Salmonella are highly attenuated even when injected into mammalian hosts; host survival increases, and the mutant bacteria do not readily replicate and are cleared during infections.
15562316:86	In the fly, not only does host survival increase during infection by SPI1 or SPI2 mutants but, paradoxically, the bacteria are not cleared and replicate better than their wild-type parents.
15562316:87	This is an interesting difference, because it separates mere bacterial presence from pathogenesis and disease.
15562316:88	It remains to be determined why the fly does not clear the mutant bacteria in the manner that is seen in the mammalian host.
15562316:89	The analysis of adult hemocytes in the fly is difficult, because we lack good molecular markers for them, and the cells are sessile and rare enough to make them difficult to find regularly in tissue sections.
15562316:90	We therefore turned to a functional assay to monitor the behavior of these infected cells by determining their ability to carry out one of their definitive behaviors, phagocytosis.
15562316:91	Flies were infected with wild-type and mutant Salmonella and then assayed for the phagocytic capacity of the hemocytes on their dorsal surface.
15562316:92	Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dead were injected into flies and incubated for 60 min to allow time for phagocytosis to occur.
15562316:93	Trypan blue was then injected into the flies to quench the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria.
15562316:94	Uptake of the was then monitored by observing the flies under FITC illumination with a dissecting microscope.
15562316:95	At day 1 post- Salmonella infection, hemocytes infected with wild-type, SPI1 -mutant, SPI2 -mutant, and SlrP bacteria showed similar phagocytic activities (unpublished data).
15562316:96	Following 7 d of infection, flies infected with wild-type or slrP -mutant bacteria had greatly reduced numbers of phagocytic cells ( C– H).
15562316:97	In contrast, phagocytes remained active during the course of infection by SPI1 or SPI2 mutants.
15562316:98	Our interpretation of this experiment is that the wild-type Salmonella infection results in death of phagocytes or a reduced capacity for phagocytosis.
15562316:99	This reduction is not dependent on SlrP function.
15562316:100	In mammals, cytokines such as TNF and interferon relay information about infection through the body.
15562316:101	Cytokine expression, in particular TNF expression, is responsible directly and indirectly for a significant degree of the pathology observed during microbial infection.
15562316:102	Flies have one known TNF-like protein, encoded by the gene eiger ( ; ).
15562316:103	Overexpression of eiger can induce cell death, but no phenotype had been identified for loss-of-function mutants thus far.
15562316:104	We infected wild-type and eiger – flies with Salmonella to determine whether this fly TNF homolog played a role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections in Drosophila . The mean time to death was lengthened by 3 d in the two eiger mutants tested ( A).
15562316:105	This experiment suggests that eiger /TNF signaling during a Salmonella infection contributes to the rate of death of the fly.
15562316:106	Accumulation of Salmonella did not differ between eiger mutants and the background fly strain ( B).
15562316:107	This suggests that eiger mutants do not directly affect Salmonella growth, but do markedly affect host survival.
15562316:108	RNA transcripts of eiger were not significantly altered during Salmonella infection in comparison to Luria broth (LB)-injected controls ( C).
15562316:109	This suggests that if eiger is regulated during Salmonella infection, the transcriptional changes are too small to be seen relative to expression in whole flies or the changes are posttranscriptional.
15562316:110	In human disease, morbidity and mortality are often the result of immune responses to invading pathogens rather than to direct action of the pathogens themselves.
15562316:111	Fever, inflammation, and shock are examples of such processes.
15562316:112	In plants, a model is emerging in which host cells monitor important cell functions and respond to their perturbations by pathogens ( ; ).
15562316:113	We suggest the infection caused by Salmonella in the fly has attributes of both models.
15562316:114	Salmonella growth appears to be restricted to hemocytes by action of the humoral immune response.
15562316:115	Perhaps the manipulation of these hemocytes by secreted effectors induces additional immune responses that limit bacterial growth.
15562316:116	This resembles what is seen in a resistant plant infected by a bacterium expressing the appropriate avirulence protein.
15562316:117	Such proteins are secreted into the plant cell's cytoplasm via a TTSA, and they alter the host cell's physiology, presumably to make growth conditions for the bacteria more favorable.
15562316:118	Resistant plants can sense this physiological change and raise a type of immune reaction called a hypersensitive response.
15562316:119	In the case of Drosophila, we suggest that the fly's immune response not only limits the growth of the pathogen but also damages the fly and ultimately leads to its death.
15562316:120	When is prevented from using its secreted effectors, the bacteria survive in the phagocyte and grow to higher numbers, possibly because the bacteria are not being attacked as intensely by the host.
15562316:121	The result is that there are more bacteria in the fly and host death is greatly delayed.
15562316:122	These two properties appear to be separable.
15562316:123	The mutations in eiger suggest that there are signaling events that increase the death rate in the fly but do not alter the numbers of Salmonella . These experiments provide a new genetic model to explore microbial choice of pathogenic lifestyles in addition to a potential new genetic model for the study of TNF-induced metabolic collapse.

21776369:1	Introduction 
Clinicians frequently observe stroke patients with disturbed sleep in hospital, and there is a notable lack of studies describing their sleep-wake patterns . Polysomnography (PSG) studies of the sleep of stroke patients during night time have reported both insomnia (difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep at night) and hypersomnia (inability to stay awake and excessive daytime sleepiness)  . 
Poor sleep efficiency and wakefulness after sleep onset are associated with reduced cognitive function in the acute phase after stroke  and nonrestorative sleep is described as restless, light, or poor-quality sleep, even when its duration appears normal.
21776369:2	Poor sleep is also associated with daytime impairment .
21776369:3	After a stroke, restorative sleep is essential to gain physical and psychological energy, but it must be taken into consideration that age and numbers of medical condition influence patients' sleep quality . 
The aims of this study were to describe the sleep of patients in the acute phase after their first-ever stroke and to explore the relationships between sleep and sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, the patient's environmental context for sleep and self-reported sleep quality.
21776369:4	There were two specific research questions.
21776369:5	2.
21776369:6	Materials and Methods 
The study was a descriptive cross-sectional design.
21776369:7	A sample of patients was recruited sequentially from two hospital wards in Norway.
21776369:8	The design included both subjective and objective measures within the first two weeks after diagnosis of a first-ever stroke.
21776369:9	3.
21776369:10	Results 
4. Discussion 
This is the first study to our knowledge which describes the sleep-wake patterns in stroke patients during the acute phase.
21776369:11	Although the estimated mean TST (426 minutes) was within the normal range for sleep in healthy adults , our results show a large variation in sleep during night time, which may indicate either insomnia or hypersomnia after a stroke  . Only 52% of the patients had estimated sleep within what is recommended as normal sleep time per night (6–8 hours) in an adult population . 
The high WASO and WAKES per night in this sample raises the question of whether sleep during the acute phase after a stroke can be considered restorative, when the normal WASO is less than 10% of TST and people normally are awaken fewer than six times a night . In general, actigraphy has been criticized for overestimating TST and underestimating WAKES  especially in populations with fragmented sleep.
21776369:12	In a comparison study between PSG and actigraphy, it is shown that WAKES are difficult to detect if the subject lies immobile with an actigraph . Especially older people may lay still and awake at night time.
21776369:13	If this is the case, in our study, the TST may be lower and the number of WAKES and the WASO may be even higher than our results have shown.
21776369:14	However, our results are consistent with PSG findings [ , ], in which stroke patients had higher WASO than age and gender-matched controls.
21776369:15	It has been demonstrated that memory and attention decrease as WASO increases , and so disrupted sleep may result in poor sleep quality.
21776369:16	The sample in our study was predominantly older patients, and it can be argued that older individuals wake more often than the general population.
21776369:17	However WAKES and WASO differed considerably from normal values.
21776369:18	Patients who slept in the hospital had more WAKES than those who slept at home all three nights.
21776369:19	The effect size of this relationship was medium, indicating a probable clinical significance . Hospital environment is often known to have higher levels of noise, light, and interruptions that may disturb sleep.
21776369:20	By objective measures, sleeping in hospital resulted in more fragmented, and thus less restorative sleep than sleeping at home in our sample, but there was no difference by self-report measure.
21776369:21	If the medical and practical conditions at home are favorable, it may be better for the patient's sleep quality to sleep at home even in the acute phase after a stroke.
21776369:22	Restorative sleep may promote the rehabilitation process in stroke patients.
21776369:23	Daytime estimated sleep was related to a longer hospital stay, but this relationship was not evident after controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual variables and self-reported sleep.
21776369:24	However, daytime sleepiness is associated with nonrestorative sleep and deterioration in performance even in a general population . More daytime sleep (by observation and wrist actigraphy) has been reported in a study of patients undergoing rehabilitation and is linked to less immediate functional recovery in these patients . An overestimation of sleep during daytime may be suspected in immobile patients, as with TST.
21776369:25	The mean sleep during daytime was 85 minutes and was not surprisingly high, but the variation was large.
21776369:26	It remains to explore whether sleep during daytime is a sign of passivity or a way to compensate for disturbed sleep at night.
21776369:27	The self-reported sleep quality (PSQI) score averaged 6.9, which is above the cut point used in most populations (5 on a 0–21 scale) to indicate poor sleep . The patient's self-reported sleep quality correlated with the estimated TST and WASO from their actigraphy data.
21776369:28	Even though it is well known that men have poorer sleep quality as they age (less slow wave sleep) compared to women of similar age , this might not be considered in clinical practice.
21776369:29	Men in our study had less sleep than women during night time, and this might be a consequence of age but remain an important finding.
21776369:30	Sleep hygiene interventions, such as avoiding caffeine before bedtime, use of hypnotic agents, decreasing arousal and light at night should be gender-tailored strategies.
21776369:31	Patient and family education about general sleep hygiene could be beneficial for improving the restorative function of sleep during the acute phase after a stroke . 
5.
21776369:32	Conclusion 
The variability in our results indicates that both hypersomnia and insomnia may occur in the acute phase after first-ever stroke.
21776369:33	Estimated sleep was especially disturbing in men regardless of age, and heath care workers should pay special attention to men“s” poor sleep-wake patterns during the acute phase while in hospital.
21776369:34	The number of times the patients woke and the amount of waking time during nights were considerable.
21776369:35	Further research is needed to assess a possible relationship between sleep-wake patterns in the acute phase and the patient's' participation in the rehabilitation process.

Results 
Discussion 
This is the first study to provide detailed data on the prevalence and determinants of smoking in Ghana.
19581276:1	Our finding of higher smoking prevalence among men is consistent with previous studies in Ghana  and elsewhere in Africa,  while our overall adjusted estimates of current smoking prevalence, at 3.8%, and of ever smoking at 9.7%, indicate that the prevalence of smoking in Ghana is one of the lowest in Africa.
19581276:2	Our data on self-reported age at uptake of smoking, combined with the lower rates of current smoking among younger than older age groups and the high proportion of ex-smokers in all age groups, suggest that population uptake has increased only slowly during the past 50 years or so, and therefore that Ghana has thus far avoided the marked increase in smoking prevalence that often accompanies economic development.
19581276:3	We limited our study to the Ashanti region of the country for logistic reasons, but chose this region because it is the most heavily populated of the 10 regions of Ghana, and is generally representative of the national population.
19581276:4	Participation was high, at 88%, though higher in females than males, and we weighted our prevalence estimates to allow for this non-response.
19581276:5	Nevertheless, the male-to-female ratio of our sampled population at 59:41 differed from the national ratio of 53:47.
19581276:6	The reasons for the male under-representation is not clear; we attempted to ascertain the names of all long-term residents (defined as any person who had lived at the address for at least one year) in each household, and one possibility is that a substantial proportion of men had left or were otherwise long-term absentees from the family home.
19581276:7	We have no further data to assess whether the smoking behaviour of the men in our sample population is representative of men in Ashanti, or in the wider Ghanaian population.
19581276:8	However, allowing for male under-representation relative to the national population increased our prevalence estimate by only 0.9 percentage points.
19581276:9	We attempted to minimise the possibility that responses would be affected by social pressures against smoking, particularly on women and young people, by interviewing respondents individually, and as privately as possible.
19581276:10	However, it is possible that such pressures have resulted in a degree of underestimation of true prevalence in those groups.
19581276:11	Previous studies of smoking in Ghana are few and have involved either very small and unrepresentative samples, have been limited to young people, or in the case of the one national survey to date, based on responses to only three questions.
19581276:12	However the findings of these studies are all broadly consistent with ours, indicating that the prevalence of smoking in Ghana is indeed low in absolute terms, and in relation to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
19581276:13	The low prevalence of smoking among women is a typical finding in African countries, and has been attributed to limitation of opportunities to smoke by low levels of economic independence among women, and sociocultural contexts within which smoking among women is often considered to be immoral.
19581276:14	Our observation that current smokers are likely to have friends who smoke, tend to use alcohol and to be less physically active, is also consistent with other reports.
19581276:15	That cigarette consumption almost doubled over the weekend perhaps also reflects the influence of social pressures or incentives to smoke.
19581276:16	Our finding that smoking is more prevalent among the less well educated, less economically active and relatively less affluent members of the population contrasts with the typical pattern of the early stages of uptake of smoking in most countries, including many developing countries, where smoking of manufactured cigarettes often occurs first among those in paid employment.
19581276:17	Our findings demonstrate that smoking imposes a substantial economic cost on those who smoke, since most smokers spend more than one Ghanaian cedi on smoking per day; this represents about a third of the likely wage of the typical smoker in our study.
19581276:18	That approximately 10% of all cigarettes purchased by our study population were brands that are not marketed in Ghana affirms the longstanding problem of smuggling in Ghana, particularly from Togo.
19581276:19	Ghana has enjoyed consistent economic growth over recent years, and from the time that Ghana first became independent in 1957 until as recently as 2006, British American Tobacco has had an active manufacturing facility in the country.
19581276:20	Given this relative affluence and a local source of manufactured cigarettes from an early stage, Ghana might therefore be expected to be at a relatively advanced stage of the tobacco epidemic in relation to other developing countries, and to have a relatively high prevalence of smoking.
19581276:21	The picture emerging from our data is however more complex, perhaps reflecting the inability of the traditional model of the tobacco epidemic, based on trends observed in the West to adequately explain patterns elsewhere.
19581276:22	Thus, although the low rates of smoking and gender disparity suggest Ghana may be at an early stage of the epidemic, most aspects of our data (the significant proportion of ex-smokers, lower rates of smoking in younger than older age groups and lower rates among the more educated), are all consistent with Ghana being at a relatively late stage, and therefore perhaps avoiding the expected high prevalence of smoking.
19581276:23	Results consistent with this interpretation, reporting a fall in smoking prevalence among civil servants in Accra, have been reported elsewhere.
19581276:24	Cultural factors may have had a strong influence on the pattern of smoking in Ghana.
19581276:25	Ghana is a religious country with substantial Christian (70%) and Muslim (17%) populations, among whom smoking was relatively uncommon in our study, in contrast with those of Traditionalist (a belief in the existence of lesser gods, with adherence to traditional Ghanaian customs) faith.
19581276:26	Whether these associations are causal, and if so how, is not clear from our data.
19581276:27	We have also reported elsewhere that Ghana’s low smoking prevalence and tobacco use may also have been attributable to the imposition of partial government ownership of the main tobacco company in Ghana at the early stage of epidemic growth in smoking prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s, and to a lack of foreign exchange to fund tobacco leaf importations in addition to implementation of a ban on tobacco advertising in 1982.
19581276:28	In reality, Ghana’s experience of low tobacco use and smoking prevalence to date probably reflects a broad mix of cultural and political influences, and does not necessarily imply that a more marked increase in smoking prevalence will not occur in the future.
19581276:29	It remains to be seen whether Ghana’s experience will be replicated in other developing countries in Africa and elsewhere in the world.

21216943:0	INTRODUCTION 
 is part of the normal microflora in the gastrointestinal tract and is also a clinically important opportunistic pathogen in humans.
21216943:1	A parasexual mating pathway in this obligately diploid fungus has been investigated intensively over the last 10 years, and the studies have shown similarities to and distinct differences from the orthologous mating process in mating may occur on or within the human body and has been shown to occur either through heterothallic or homothallic interactions ( , , ).
21216943:2	Transcriptome studies showed that the mating response involved the upregulation of a specific set of genes via the transcription factor Cph1, which also regulates virulence factor expression and promotes filamentous growth.
21216943:3	This suggests that the mating response in may directly influence host-pathogen interactions as well as creating novel recombinant genotypes via genetic recombination.
21216943:4	Although the activity of pheromone-regulated transcription factors has been described, the function of their effectors has received less attention.
21216943:5	Unlike the case for mating in the haploid yeast diploid cells must first become homozygous at the mating-type locus (MTL), which promotes the switch from white yeast-shaped cells to mating-competent, bean-shaped opaque cells ( , ).
21216943:6	The mechanism that leads to homozygosity is not well understood, but the genotype can be generated either by deletion of the MTL a or MTL α genes or by plating cells on l-sorbose, which causes loss of one copy of chromosome 5 bearing the MTL.
21216943:7	In vitro MTL-homozygous cells arise predominantly by the loss of one chromosome 5 homolog, followed by duplication of the retained homolog.
21216943:8	MTL-homozygous cells switch to the opaque form at high frequency to produce mating-competent, pheromone-secreting mating partners that form shmoo mating projections.
21216943:9	In the process of shmoo formation, pheromone-dependent chemotropism can occur in a biofilm which stabilizes chemotropic gradients, hence, facilitating the directed growth of mating projections toward each other.
21216943:10	Chemotropism is followed by fusion and the formation of a tetraploid daughter cell.
21216943:11	In calcium influx is essential for cell survival and efficient fusion of gametes during the mating process.
21216943:12	In directional growth responses depend on the influx of calcium ions through calcium channels in the plasma membrane.
21216943:13	Two calcium uptake systems in have been described, and homologous systems in have been identified ( , ).
21216943:14	The high-affinity calcium uptake system (HACS), comprising the Mid1-Cch1 complex, is activated in low-Ca 2+ medium and in response to alkaline, cold, iron, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress ( , ).
21216943:15	A third protein, Fig1 (mating actor- nduced ene 1), was identified as a component of the low-affinity calcium uptake system (LACS) that was activated during growth in rich medium.
21216943:16	In deletion of calcium channel gene CCH1 or MID1 reduced Ca 2+ uptake during vegetative growth, but deletion of FIG1 had no measurable effect on calcium ion transport in yeast or hyphal cells.
21216943:17	However, Ca fig1 Δ null mutants had altered hyphal tropic responses, suggesting that Ca FIG1 was expressed at low levels during vegetative growth.
21216943:18	FIG1 expression was upregulated in both and in response to mating pheromone.
21216943:19	In FIG1 expression increased 5- to 7-fold in response to mating pheromone and Fig1-green fluorescent protein (ScFig1-GFP) was distributed homogeneously in the plasma membrane of shmoos and to occasional reticular or punctate intracellular foci.
21216943:20	Deletion of Sc FIG1 resulted in incomplete fusion between the tips of mating shmoos, which was thought to be due to the loss of a calcium-dependent membrane repair mechanism.
21216943:21	Transcription profiling in suggested that Fig1 function could be likewise predominantly associated with the mating process because white/opaque switching and exposure to mating pheromone caused a significant increase in FIG1 gene expression.
21216943:22	There is no clear Fig1 homologue outside the fungal kingdom, but the protein sequence contains characteristics found in the large mammalian PMP22/EMP/MP20/claudin superfamily (NCBI accession number ), the members of which selectively limit or promote paracellular ion flux across epithelial tight junctions and regulate the expression of proteins at the cell surface.
21216943:23	Sequence characteristics include four putative transmembrane domains and a conserved claudin motif [GΦΦGxC(n)C, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid and n is any number] in the large first extracellular loop.
21216943:24	Claudin-like proteins in fungi include Sur7 in and Dni1 in . Sur7 is an eisosome protein involved in plasma membrane organization and cell wall growth.
21216943:25	In Dni1-GFP localized to sites of apposition between mating cells, and its deletion caused fusion defects which appeared to be due to membrane mislocalization.
21216943:26	These two claudin-like proteins in fungi therefore appear to be involved in membrane dynamics.
21216943:27	In Fig1 has been associated with tip reorientation in response to environmental cues.
21216943:28	Chemotropism of mating projections in response to pheromone and thigmotropism of vegetative hyphae require directionally regulated polarized growth.
21216943:29	The molecular processes involved in tip guidance are not well understood but appear to involve Ca 2+ uptake.
21216943:30	Both polarized growth morphologies are Cph1 dependent, and gene deletion and transcription studies indicate that Fig1 activity could be involved in Ca 2+ influx and in tropic tip guidance ( , ).
21216943:31	However, the role of Fig1 in shmoo orientation and in mating for has not been defined.
21216943:32	Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of Fig1 during mating by studying calcium uptake, gene expression, and protein localization during the mating process.
21416024:0	INTRODUCTION 
The 10/66 Dementia Research Group (10/66) was founded ten years ago at the annual conference of Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) in Cochin, India.
21416024:1	10/66 refers to the less than one-tenth of all population-based research into dementia that had been directed towards the two-thirds or more of people with dementia living in developing countries.
21416024:2	10/66 was formed to redress this imbalance, encouraging active research collaboration between centers in different developing countries and between developed and developing countries.
21416024:3	The Cochin symposium established priorities for 10/66, described in a consensus publication co-authored by the founding members.
21416024:4	More research was needed to describe prevalence and incidence and to explore regional variations using harmonized methods.
21416024:5	Another priority was the description of care arrangements for people with dementia, quantifying the impact upon caregivers of providing care and evaluating the effectiveness of new services for people with dementia and their caregivers.
21416024:6	The group identified potential through good quality research for generating awareness, pioneering service development and influencing policy.
21416024:7	Now is an opportune time to review progress in India and in other regions.
21416024:8	This review will focus, but not exclusively, upon the work of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group.
21416024:9	FORMATIVE STAGE (1998-2003) 
Methodological issues needed first to be addressed.
21416024:10	Accordingly, 10/66 carried out pilot investigations in 26 centers from 16 developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, India, Russia, China and SE Asia.
21416024:11	2885 persons aged 60 and over were interviewed, 729 people with dementia, and 3 groups free of dementia: 702 with depression, 694 with high education and 760 with low education.
21416024:12	Seven centers in India participated in this phase of the project, two from Chennai, and one each from Bangalore, Goa, Hyderabad, Thrissur and Vellore.
21416024:13	We aimed 1) to develop and validate a one-phase education- and culture-fair dementia diagnostic algorithm to be used in populations with very little formal education and in very different countries and cultures and 2) to obtain preliminary information on care arrangements for people with dementia, the impact upon caregivers of providing care and the common behavior problems that they encounter across regions and cultures.
21416024:14	PREVALENCE PHASE (2003-PRESENT) 
The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia was patchy in many world regions, hampering previous estimates of the global burden of the disease.
21416024:15	The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has now completed population-based surveys (2003-2007) of dementia prevalence and impact in 12 sites in eight low and middle income countries (India, China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Peru).
21416024:16	Further surveys are underway in Argentina, Puerto Rico, Nigeria and South Africa.
21416024:17	Cross-sectional comprehensive one phase surveys have been conducted of all residents aged 65 and over of geographically defined catchment areas in each site with a sample size of 2000 in each country.
21416024:18	The net result will be a unique resource of directly comparable data on over 20,000 older adults from three continents.
21416024:19	All studies use the same cross-culturally validated assessments (dementia diagnosis and subtypes, other mental and physical health, anthropometry, demographics, extensive non-communicable disease risk factor questionnaires, disability/functioning, health service utilization, care arrangements and caregiver strain).
21416024:20	A publicly accessible data archive has been established as a resource for the academic community.
21416024:21	INCIDENCE PHASE (2007-2010) 
The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has just begun a 2.5 to three year incidence phase follow-up of the baseline sample.
21416024:22	The incidence phase will exploit the rich baseline cross-sectional data in the six Latin American countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, Peru and Argentina) and in China to assess risk factors for incident dementia, stroke and mortality.
21416024:23	Verbal autopsy will be used to identify causes of death.
21416024:24	The incidence phase will involve approximately 15,000 older people.
21416024:25	First results should be available in early 2009, and the incidence phase will be completed in 2010.
21416024:26	We will estimate the annual incidence rate of dementia and its subtypes, by age group, education and centre, and investigate risk factors for incident dementia and AD, focusing upon cardiovascular risk factors, micronutrient deficiencies and other dietary deficiencies, anemia and sub-clinical hypothyroidism.
21416024:27	We will also seek to confirm the predictive validity of the survey dementia diagnoses (DSM IV and “the 10/66 dementia algorithm”) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) through three-year follow-up of all dementia and MCI cases, and to carry out a longitudinal study of evolving care arrangements for people with dementia, and caregiver strain.
21416024:28	SERVICE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION (ONGOING) 
People with dementia and their families are particularly unlikely to access healthcare, despite the high levels of associated disability and caregiver strain.
21416024:29	Lack of demand for services arises in part from a tendency to view dementia as a normal part of ageing.
21416024:30	Encouraging help-seeking requires community dissemination to increase awareness with information from government, healthcare providers and media.
21416024:31	However, efforts to increase demand must be accompanied by health system and service reform, so that help-seeking is met with a supply of better-prepared, more responsive services.
21416024:32	In parallel with its epidemiological surveys, 10/66 has been testing the effectiveness of training community healthcare workers to identify people with dementia  and to deliver a brief intervention to educate and train caregivers.
21416024:33	Initial findings, from the first two of several randomized controlled trials in Goa and in Moscow show highly promising results.
21416024:34	In practice, such interventions will need to be incorporated into horizontally constructed programs addressing the generic needs of frail, dependent older people and their caregivers, whether arising from cognitive, mental or physical disorders.
21416024:35	FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Clearly progress has been made.
21416024:36	A recent Lancet review highlights both the growing awareness of the importance of dementia in developing countries and the burgeoning evidence base.
21416024:37	Nevertheless, much more research is needed to close the 10/66 gap.
21416024:38	There is still a need for a definitive multi-centric prevalence survey in India with true nationwide scope, encompassing regional, cultural, ethnic, religious, socioeconomic and rural/ urban diversity.
21416024:39	Such a survey, whether or not it used the 10/66 methodology, would be enhanced by a common protocol in all centers, with a one phase design including the ascertainment of comorbid chronic diseases, disability, needs for care, care arrangements and health service utilization.
21416024:40	It would provide a much needed baseline to monitor, in future surveys, trends in demographic ageing and the health transition.
21416024:41	Also missing, for India, is any large-scale prospective study of risk factors for dementia, with biological samples (DNA, hematology, fasting glucose and lipids and frozen serum for later evaluation), other cardiovascular risk factor exposures, diet and anthropometry all collected at baseline.
21416024:42	The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has succeeded in establishing such a study across our Latin American network and, to an extent in China, but not yet in India where the need is just as great.
21416024:43	Finally, there is a great need, as indicated above, to develop packages and programs of care for people with dementia and their caregivers, which, their cost-effectiveness having been established, would be capable of being scaled up across India’s complex mixed healthcare system.
null:0	Introduction 
Activated protein C (PC) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation . PC deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene encoding PC, and is clinically associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis .
null:1	At present, nearly 200 various mutations in the PC gene have been described and the functional effects of several PC mutations shown to be associated with PC deficiency have previously been studied in-vitro – . The majority of the missense mutations in PC lead to protein misfolding and consequently to retention of the mutants in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with subsequent degradation by proteasomes in a process called ER associated degradation (ERAD) – . 
PC is synthesized in liver cells where it is subjected to several posttranslational modifications in the ER and in the Golgi apparatus . The processing of proteins in ER is controlled by chaperones, which facilitate protein folding and ensure that only correctly folded proteins are transported from the ER to Golgi . Accumulation of misfolded proteins in ER can disturb homeostasis and result in ER stress, which activates the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR).
null:2	This response eliminates ER stress by increasing the efficiency of protein folding, promoting ERAD and attenuating protein synthesis of mutated proteins . Up-regulated expression of chaperones has been demonstrated in several studies on mutated proteins in general . A majority of the reported misfolded glycoproteins, including some mutated PC variants – are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane and degraded by ERAD.
null:3	Some of the other mutant proteins are degraded by other proteases found in the ER and in the cytosol – .
null:4	However, a few studies have described misfolded proteins, which were retained in the ER for a longer period of time without being degraded at all.
null:5	These proteins were accumulated in the ER and led to elevated ER stress evidenced by increased expression levels of proteins such as the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), all common markers of ER stress and UPR activation , .
null:6	It has been shown that accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER was associated with activation of PERK resulting in phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) with subsequent down-regulation of the protein synthesis – . Prolonged ER stress and UPR activation are associated with ERAD dysfunction, cell injury and apoptosis contributing to pathogenesis of many diseases , – . 
In a recent study we found that both the intra- and extracellular levels of the PC-A267T mutant were strongly reduced compared to the wild-type PC (PC-wt) in transiently transfected cells despite the fact that there were no differences in the mRNA level.
null:7	The aim of the present study was to obtain further insight into potential mechanisms of PC deficiency caused by the A267T mutation using stably transfected cells.
null:8	We demonstrate that the A267T mutation caused retention of the PC molecule in the ER, most probably due to increased association with chaperones.
null:9	In contrast to what has been reported for other PC mutants, the PC-A267T was only slightly subjected to proteasomal degradation, rather it induced ER stress, UPR activation and apoptosis in the cells.
null:10	Materials and Methods 
Results 
We have previuosly found, using transient transfected cells, that the intracellular and secreted PC-A267T levels were reduced compared to PC-wt, and the majority of the PC mutant was localized in ER . The reduced levels and retention of PC-A267T were confirmed in the stably transfected cells (data not shown).
null:11	Discussion 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular basis of PC deficiency caused by the A267T mutation using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the wild-type or PC mutant.
null:12	Compared to PC-wt, which was located both in the ER and in the Golgi, PC-A267T was predominantly located in the ER indicating increased retention of the mutant.
null:13	This was probably due to increased association with chaperones to the PC mutant.
null:14	In contrast to other PC mutations studied in vitro, the retention of PC-A267T in the ER was not mainly associated with increased ERAD, rather it resulted in ER stress and UPR, which probably affected the PC biosynthesis.
null:15	Several missense mutations associated with PC deficiency have previously been studied in-vitro – . Some of these variants showed reduced secretion of PC into the culture medium due to their efficient degradation by ERAD – . The PC-A267T represents a different variant of a PC mutation based on the fact that although its secretion is severely impaired, the proteasomal degradation is only slightly elevated compared to the PC-wt and not sufficient to explain the reduced PC levels.
null:16	Although proteasomal degradation is the most common pathway for the elimination of mutated proteins, several studies have described degradation of misfolded proteins by proteasome-independent pathways – . In the present study, the results of the pulse-chase analysis and the treatment with several inhibitors of these alternative pathways gave no indications that the PC-A267T was degraded faster than the PC-wt.
null:17	Thus, alternative mechanisms are most likely responsible for the reduced levels of this PC mutant.
null:18	Abnormalities in protein folding due to mutations have been attributed to the pathology of a number of diseases.
null:19	Improper folded or misfolded proteins are recognized and retained by the folding chaperone machinery of the ER . Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that PC-A267T was retained in the ER and analysis of PC-chaperone complexes suggested that the retention most likely was due to increased association of chaperones suggesting that PC-A267T could be misfolded.
null:20	This is in agreement with previous studies, which demonstrated that mutations in coagulation factors such as factor VII factor IX and also PC were associated with reduced protein secretion and prolonged association of the mutated proteins with chaperones in ER.
null:21	In our study, we revealed that the PC mutant was associated with calreticulin and Grp-94, both well-known chaperones.
null:22	Calreticulin interacts with N-linked glycoproteins and has several functions in the folding and assembling of these proteins.
null:23	Grp-94 is a chaperone, which was found to be associated with several misfolded proteins, but its role in protein folding is not well understood.
null:24	Although we found increased expression levels of BiP in cells expressing PC-A267T, no interaction of BiP with PC-A267T could be detected.
null:25	Increased binding of mutated proteins to chaperones in ER is a well documented phenomenon, and can result in either increased ERAD or increased folding efficiency of misfolded proteins .
null:26	The mechanism regulating the balance between folding and degradation of misfolded proteins is as yet not known.
null:27	Several studies have, however, suggested that the destiny of misfolded proteins in the ER was dependent on the nature of the mutation and the chaperones available in the cells . Sekijima et al. analyzed a large number of mutations in the transthyretin protein and concluded that the destiny of this protein was determined by the kinetic and the thermodynamic properties of the protein conformation caused by a mutation.
null:28	A variety of chemical chaperones, such as DMSO, and growing cells at low temperature, have been reported to efficiently improve the conformation of several misfolded proteins trapped in ER – . In our study, the secretion level of PC-A267T was not increased to the PC-wt level, neither by growing the cells at 26°C nor in the presence of DMSO.
null:29	This indicates that the PC mutant did not adopt suitable conformation to be efficiently secreted.
null:30	Based on these results it is impossible to establish that the PC-A267T mutant exhibits a folding defect that can be corrected by low temperature or DMSO.
null:31	However, one can imagine that the PC-A267T mutation only causes a minor defect on the protein structure and that the ER quality machinery was unable to recognize the mutant protein as misfolded enough to direct it to ERAD.
null:32	This hypothesis is in agreement with the interpretation of the A267T mutation obtained by a computational approach, as not being destructive on PC structure and function.
null:33	Inefficient elimination of misfolded proteins by ERAD may lead to accumulation of mutated proteins in ER and several studies have shown that misfolded proteins, which were retained in ER without being efficiently degraded, activated ER stress and UPR , . The main task of the UPR is to protect the cells from toxic effects of accumulated and aggregated mutated proteins in ER.
null:34	The signaling cascade of UPR involves chaperone-assisted protein folding and increased transcription of genes encoding chaperones.
null:35	One of the best characterized chaperone is BiP, which has a range of functions within the ER.
null:36	BiP interacts with hydrophobic regions of misfolded proteins and facilitates folding, thus preventing aggregation in ER.
null:37	In addition, BiP plays a central role in the regulation of UPR and elevated BiP levels are detected upon pathological stress responses . In this study, we found increased expression level of BiP in cells expressing PC-A267T indicating that the retention of the mutant in ER induced ER stress and UPR activation.
null:38	Another common effect of UPR activation is attenuation of mRNA translation in order to prevent influx of newly synthesized polypeptides in ER – .
null:39	Although no evidence that the A267T mutation affected PC mRNA translation is provided in the present study, the increased level of P-eIF2α detected in cells expressing PC-A267T might indicate that the synthesis of PC was reduced as a result of UPR activation.
null:40	Despite initially beneficial effects of UPR in cells expressing misfolding-prone proteins, prolonged ER stress and UPR activation can lead to cell dysfunction and apoptotic cell death . Several studies indicated that excessive UPR activation could affect normal cell functions, such as intracellular protein transport and proteasomal degradation . In our study, the cells expressing the PC mutant had increased apoptotic activity as measured by elevated DNA fragmentation.
null:41	In accordance with other studies, which reported that ER stress and UPR activation were the key events leading to functional impairment of cells producing the mutant proteins – we suggest that the biosynthesis of PC-A267T was strongly impaired in the stably transfected CHO-K1 cells.
null:42	In summary, our study provides evidence that retention of the PC-A267T resulted in ER stress, UPR activation and apoptosis in CHO-K1 cells.
null:43	This is in contrast to what has been reported for other PC mutants, which were degraded by the proteasomes.
null:44	Thus, the present PC mutant represents the first example where proteasomal degradation is not the main mechanism for cells to manage mutant PC molecules.
20839077:0	Introduction 
There is growing recognition that bipolar affective disorder is associated with neurocognitive deficits and allied neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic anomalies [ •].
20839077:1	While mood states and psychotropic medication usage influence cognition and brain physiology, observations that many of these neurocognitive and structural and functional neuroanatomic abnormalities predate symptom onset or persist during symptom remission raise the possibility that some changes in brain structure and function are central to the pathophysiology of bipolar affective disorder . Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that neurocognitive and neuroimaging factors are associated with clinical outcome, psychosocial functioning, and vocational disability in bipolar disorder . The goal of this review is to synthesize these recent findings to assess their clinical relevance and highlight areas in need of additional research.
20839077:2	Almost two thirds of bipolar patients have some level of inter-episode functional impairment , and about half are unemployed or have reduced occupational functioning . Thus, although many individuals with bipolar disorder respond well to treatments designed to reduce affective and psychotic symptoms, the ability to achieve functional recovery—the capacity to study, work, engage in recreation, live independently, and engage in romantic relationships—may be significantly hindered.
20839077:3	Therefore, recovery from mood episodes and/or residual symptoms does not necessarily translate into functional recovery.
20839077:4	Indeed, many patients with bipolar illness do not regain premorbid levels of psychosocial functioning . Studies of the lifetime course of bipolar disorder consistently find that during periods of symptomatic recovery, bipolar individuals often continue to experience residual mood symptoms that likely contribute to increased levels of disability and decreased psychosocial functioning . Clinical factors—in particular disease chronicity, severity, and subsyndromal depressive symptoms—are associated with poor functional outcome . In addition, as reviewed in detail below, there is growing evidence for a relationship between neurocognitive function, underlying neuroanatomic abnormalities, and functional outcome across a range of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar illness  . A better understanding of the relationship between neurocognitive and neuroimaging measures and clinical outcome has the potential to improve current treatment options and provide targets for new treatment strategies.
20839077:5	Neurocognitive Findings in Bipolar Disorder 
Although there is clear evidence that patients with bipolar disorder exhibit widespread neurocognitive dysfunction during acute episodes of mania and depression, the discovery that these deficits endure during symptom remission raises the possibility that cognitive impairment may represent a trait rather than a state variable . Euthymic bipolar patients exhibit limitations in several cognitive domains, particularly in measures of executive function, declarative memory, and sustained attention  .
20839077:6	Although euthymic patients often present with residual affective symptoms that may adversely affect performance on cognitive tests , even those who have been euthymic for months prior to assessment have marked neuropsychological impairments . Indeed, several recent meta-analyses of neuropsychological performance in euthymic bipolar disorder have documented impairment across a wide variety of cognitive domains  . In the most recent of these meta-analyses, Kurtz and Gerraty  found that nonsymptomatic bipolar patients performed 0.4–0.9
20839077:7	SD below healthy individuals on measures of attention (e.g, Continuous Performance Test; Cohen’s d  = 0.69),
20839077:8	processing speed (e.g, digit symbol substitution; d  = 0.66),
20839077:9	working memory (e.g, Digit Span Backward; d  = 0.65),
20839077:10	declarative memory (e.g, Rey or California Verbal Learning Test; d  = 0.81),
20839077:11	nonverbal declarative memory (e.g, visual reproduction subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale; d  = 0.91), and executive functioning (e.g, Trail Making Test B; d  = 0.72).
20839077:12	Observations of neuropsychological deficits in nonsymptomatic bipolar patients suggest that these impairments may be related to the pathophysiology of the illness and, as described subsequently, are also reasonable predictors of psychosocial functioning and disability [ •].
20839077:13	Evidence that clinically unaffected relatives of patients with bipolar disorder have subtle neurocognitive impairments suggests that such deficits may reflect genetic liability for the illness.
20839077:14	A recent meta-analysis reported small but statistically significant differences (e.g, d  < 0.5) for unaffected first-degree relatives compared with healthy individuals in the domains of executive functioning and verbal memory . Another recent meta-analysis of 17 published studies included 443 first-degree relatives of bipolar patients and reported cognitive impairments in the range of small to medium effect sizes in the domains of attention (0.08–0.51), verbal learning (0.27–0.33), and executive functioning (0.22–0.36) . Glahn and colleagues [ •] recently reported that three cognitive tests (Digit Symbol Coding, Object Delayed Response Task, and Immediate Facial Memory) are genetically correlated with liability for bipolar disorder, suggesting that the same genetic factors that increase the risk of bipolar disorder influence performance on these tests.
20839077:15	Although many of the neurocognitive impairments found in individuals with bipolar disorder are present during euthymia, it is quite likely that clinical course influences test performance in bipolar disorder.
20839077:16	Indeed, age at onset, total number of mood episodes number of manic episodes, number of depressive episodes, and number and duration of hospitalizations are all factors associated with the degree of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with bipolar disorder . Furthermore, the use of psychotropic medication could impact neurocognitive functioning in bipolar patients.
20839077:17	A recent meta-analysis examining the effects of lithium on cognitive performance in bipolar disorder in 12 studies involving 276 lithium-treated and 263 lithium-free patients found a small but significant impairment in lithium-treated patients in immediate verbal learning and memory (effect size, 0.24) and creativity (effect size, 0.33) . In contrast, no significant impairments were found for delayed verbal memory, visual memory, attention, executive functioning, processing speed, or psychomotor performance.
20839077:18	Some antidepressant medications have been shown to yield adverse cognitive effects, particularly those with anticholinergic properties .
20839077:19	However, other studies have failed to find significant effects of such medications on cognition .
20839077:20	Although few studies have examined neurocognitive performance in unmedicated bipolar patients, Goswami and colleagues  found no significant differences in neurocognitive test performance between 22 drug-free euthymic bipolar patients and 22 medicated euthymic patients.
20839077:21	Together, these data suggest that although clinical course and medication usage may influence cognitive performance in bipolar disorder, these effects seem to explain only a fraction of the observed impairments.
20839077:22	Growing evidence indicates that the neurocognitive impairments contribute to poorer psychosocial functioning and increased functional disability in bipolar disorder [ – •, ].
20839077:23	For example, executive dysfunction at initial assessment has been linked to lower levels of functional recovery in this population both cross-sectionally and longitudinally [ , ].
20839077:24	Bonnin and colleagues [ •] recently found that subthreshold depressive symptoms and working memory function (digits backward) were specific predictors of occupational functioning 4 years later.
20839077:25	Similarly, bipolar patients with declarative memory deficits are less likely to return to premorbid psychosocial or occupational functioning [ , •].
20839077:26	Schizophrenia research has recently begun to distinguish between functional capacity (i.e, an estimate of one’s ability to perform tasks relevant to everyday functioning) and actual performance (i.e, what one actually does in everyday settings).
20839077:27	This distinction is important, as performance can be influenced by functional capacity as well as environmental, motivational, and other factors . Bowie and colleagues [ •] recently performed a series of confirmatory path analyses to determine how neurocognitive deficit influences real world functioning and disability in bipolar disorder.
20839077:28	A total of 130 community-dwelling individuals with bipolar disorder were assessed with neuropsychological tests, symptom measures, and performance-based social and adaptive functional competence measures in three domains of real world functioning (community and household activities, work skills, and interpersonal relationships).
20839077:29	In all models, the relationship between neurocognition and outcome was largely mediated by competence.
20839077:30	Neurocognition was related to activities directly and through a mediated relationship with adaptive competence.
20839077:31	In contrast, work skills were entirely mediated by adaptive and social competence.
20839077:32	The relationship between neurocognition and interpersonal relationships was mediated by social competence.
20839077:33	These findings imply that functional disability may persist in patients with bipolar disorder even after symptomatic recovery due to neurocognitive and skill deficits.
20839077:34	Conversely, even if a patient acquires certain neurocognitive skills but continues to experience mild mood symptomatology, changes in real world behavior might lag or not manifest at all.
20839077:35	In summary, significant evidence suggests that many individuals with bipolar disorder have at least some degree of neurocognitive deficit.
20839077:36	Although these deficits may be influenced by clinical course/severity or psychotropic medication usage, they also seem to be associated with the genetic liability for the illness, suggesting that neurocognitive deficits are an important aspect of the presentation of bipolar disorder.
20839077:37	Finally, neurocognitive impairments impact real world functioning of patients with bipolar disorder.
20839077:38	Neuroanatomic Findings in Bipolar Disorder 
The most consistently documented neuroanatomic abnormalities in adult patients with bipolar disorder are lateral ventricle enlargement (+17%) and increased rates of deep white matter hyperintensities (Odds Ratio, 2.49) [ •].
20839077:39	Reduced area or volume of the corpus callosum is also a robust finding across studies . Additional evidence for white matter involvement in bipolar disorder comes from studies finding alterations in white matter tract organization  and regional white matter volume reductions . In addition, some recent evidence indicates that white matter abnormalities may be stable, trait-based abnormalities that reflect genetic liability to the illness . Kieseppa and colleagues  found decreased left hemisphere white matter volume in bipolar probands and their nonbipolar co-twins.
20839077:40	Similarly, McDonald and colleagues  found that the genetic risk of bipolar disorder was associated with white matter reduction in the left frontal and temporoparietal regions, suggesting that left frontotemporal disconnectivity may be a genetically controlled neuroanatomic abnormality associated with bipolar illness.
20839077:41	Finally, in a large Dutch twin sample, van der Schot and colleagues [ •] found that reduction in overall white matter volume was related to the genetic risk of bipolar disorder, whereas significant environmental correlations were observed for cortical gray matter.
20839077:42	In general, findings of gray matter alterations in bipolar disorder are more variable across studies, which is likely at least partially attributable to the now well-documented effects of lithium on gray matter volume [ •, ].
20839077:43	Although a recent meta-analysis revealed an effect size of 1.17 for reduced volume of the left anterior cingulate in bipolar patients relative to controls, this finding was not significant across studies due to the high between-study heterogeneity [ •].
20839077:44	Kempton and colleagues , using voxel-based morphometry in patients with bipolar I disorder, their relatives with major depression, healthy relatives, and controls, found group differences in the left insula, cerebellum, and substantia nigra; increased left insula volume in particular was associated with genetic preposition to bipolar disorder independent of clinical phenotype.
20839077:45	In contrast, increased left substantia nigra volume was specific to those with the clinical phenotype of bipolar I disorder.
20839077:46	Changes uniquely associated with the absence of a clinical diagnosis in bipolar relatives were observed in the left cerebellum, suggesting that there may be dissociable genetic and phenotypic influences on brain structure in bipolar disorder.
20839077:47	Given the substantial body of literature on neuroanatomic changes in bipolar disorder [ •], surprisingly few studies have examined their relationship to outcome.
20839077:48	In patients with schizophrenia and those at risk of the illness, this relationship has been examined in several studies.
20839077:49	For example, accelerated ventricular enlargement in the 3 years following illness onset was associated with poor outcome in first-episode schizophrenia, whereas a progressive decrement in frontal lobe white matter was associated with greater negative symptom severity . More recently Karlsgodt and colleagues  found that the structural integrity of medial temporal white matter tracts was predictive of functional outcome in adolescents at high risk of developing psychosis.
20839077:50	Given the accumulating evidence that disrupted white matter integrity may be central to the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, white matter abnormalities represent a promising candidate for a neuroanatomic predictor of outcome.
20839077:51	Two prior studies examined white matter hyperintensities as indicators of treatment resistance  and poor outcome  in bipolar disorder.
20839077:52	Moore and colleagues  categorized patients with bipolar disorder as good or poor outcome based on treatment response and level of functioning, finding that poor outcome group members had significantly more deep and more severe subcortical punctate white matter hyperintensities relative to those in the good outcome group and healthy controls.
20839077:53	Regenold and colleagues  found that an index of treatment resistance correlated significantly with deep white matter hyperintensity volume, as well as measures of abnormal brain glucose metabolism (sorbitol and fructose) in bipolar patients but not in other patients (i.e, those with schizophrenia and neurologic controls).
20839077:54	In summary, there is strong evidence to date implicating neurocognitive factors in bipolar patients as key determinants of functional outcome.
20839077:55	Given that these cognitive abnormalities likely are reflective of underlying abnormalities in brain structure and function, we propose that microstructural white matter alterations may contribute to poor outcome.
20839077:56	Functional Neuroimaging Findings in Bipolar Disorder 
Similar to the literature relating abnormalities of brain structure to poor outcome in schizophrenia, recent functional MRI studies also have begun to document such a relationship.
20839077:57	In particular, Fusar-Poli and colleagues  found that in youth with prodromal signs of psychosis, clinical and functional improvement over follow-up was associated with a longitudinal increase in activation in the anterior cingulate and right parahippocampal gyrus during performance on an N-back task.
20839077:58	Similarly, in individuals at high clinical risk of psychosis, Sabb and colleagues  found that baseline neural activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus during performance on a language processing task was predictive of severity of positive formal thought disorder and poor social outcome at follow-up.
20839077:59	To date, no such studies have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder.
20839077:60	However, emerging literature suggests that the neurophysiology of bipolar disorder involves frontal hypoactivation with concomitant disinhibition (i.e, relative hyperactivation) of limbic structures . The subgenual prefrontal cortex modulates the affective output of limbic and paralimbic structures and cognitive output from the prefrontal cortex.
20839077:61	Recent evidence from functional MRI studies using affective processing paradigms (ie, reacting to stimuli with positive or negative emotional valence) suggests that patients with bipolar disorder may disproportionately engage limbic structures during emotionally valent tasks, regardless of mood state , although the direction of effects has not been consistent across studies.
20839077:62	Taken together, these studies suggest that corticolimbic dysregulation may underlie the emotional dysregulation and cognitive impairments associated with bipolar disorder .
20839077:63	Moreover, exaggerated medial prefrontal cortical and subcortical (putamen and amygdala) responses to emotional signals have been observed in bipolar I patients and their nonbipolar relatives, suggesting that such responses may represent heritable neurobiological abnormalities underlying bipolar disorder . 
Implications for Treatment 
Given that similar cognitive impairments and associated psychosocial and functional disabilities are seen in patients with bipolar disorder and those with schizophrenia, the adaptation of treatment strategies that have proven beneficial for schizophrenia patients may also be efficacious for bipolar patients.
20839077:64	In particular, cognitive remediation has been associated with significant, although modest, improvements in cognitive performance and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia patients .
20839077:65	However, treatment of cognitive impairment in bipolar illness remains largely unexplored.
20839077:66	The development of treatments that target cognitive impairments and functional status is an important area of future investigation in bipolar disorder.
20839077:67	Two small studies have found that rehabilitative interventions such as cognitive remediation and supported employment may be effective in improving vocational outcomes for bipolar patients, but this will require replication in larger investigations . 
Conclusions 
Although bipolar disorder historically has been viewed as a disease involving only episodic dysfunction, increasing evidence indicates that this is not the case for a substantial proportion of patients.
20839077:68	Collectively, the data reviewed above provide compelling evidence that cognitive impairments are present across multiple domains—particularly in the areas of attention, processing speed, and memory—in most bipolar patients.
20839077:69	These difficulties are observable at or soon after illness onset, and persist throughout the course of illness.
20839077:70	Given that clinically unaffected relatives of patients with bipolar disorder have similar but milder neurocognitive impairments, such deficits may reflect genetic liability for the illness.
20839077:71	Importantly, these cognitive deficits appear to have implications for real world functioning.
20839077:72	Although investigation of the neural correlates of functional disability in bipolar disorder is only in its nascent stages, given strong commonalities with schizophrenia, it is anticipated that similar relationships between structural and functional neuroanatomic abnormalities and outcome in bipolar patients will be identified.
20839077:73	The rich literature in schizophrenia—and in individuals at risk of the illness—could serve to inform areas of future research needed in bipolar disorder.
20839077:74	As recommended by Harvey and colleagues , approaches used in schizophrenia research—in particular, longitudinal assessment of cognition, neurophysiology, and psychosocial function across variations in clinical state, and separate assessment of functional capacity and real world functioning—will be highly informative when applied to the study of patients with bipolar illness.
20839077:75	A clear need exists for objective methods of assessing real world functional abilities, as subjective self-assessments are likely to be influenced by current symptoms or other illness features . Thus far, few studies have investigated specific aspects of functional status in bipolar patients and their associations with neuroanatomic, clinical, and treatment-related factors.
20839077:76	Such investigations are critical for understanding the array of determinants of disability in bipolar illness.

21518432:0	Background 
Advances in high-resolution CT scanning have led to frequent detection of peripheral T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs).
21518432:1	Although a randomized trial of lobectomy vs. limited resection for T1N0M0 NSCLC by the Lung Cancer Study Group in 1995 demonstrated that limited resection showed inferiority for prognosis and no advantage for postoperative pulmonary function compared to lobectomy , several studies conducted in Japan have demonstrated that segmentectomy is superior to lobectomy for preserving pulmonary function without worsening prognosis [ - ].
21518432:2	To preserve the pulmonary function of residual segments after segmentectomy, two techniques are considered important : (1) sparing the intersegmental vein to preserve the venous drainage of residual segments, and (2) opening the intersegmental plane without closing it for sufficient re-expansion of the residual segments.
21518432:3	However, opening the intersegmental plane causes postoperative air leakage.
21518432:4	To prevent air leakage from the intersegmental plane, closing the pleural edge of preserved segments would be useful, but it would shrink the preserved segments, resulting in insufficient re-expansion.
21518432:5	As another method to prevent air leakage, coverage of the opened intersegmental plane with polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue has been reported , but these materials are expensive.
21518432:6	For that reason, comparison of the postoperative pulmonary function and duration of postoperative air leakage between the pleural closure and mesh-cover methods is important.
21518432:7	Since April 2005, the authors have conducted segmentectomy for c-T1N0M0 NSCLC, metastatic lung tumors and other lung nodules . During the first term, April 2005 - December 2007, we closed the intersegmental plane by suturing the pleural edge of preserved segments to prevent postoperative air leakage.
21518432:8	During the second term, January 2008 - March 2009, we opened the intersegmental plane with coverage by a PGA mesh and fibrin glue, not only to maintain re-expansion of the preserved segments but also to prevent air leakage.
21518432:9	To evaluate the effectiveness of using PGA mesh and fibrin glue on the intersegmental plane for preserving pulmonary function and for preventing air leakage, we measured the preserved forced expiratory volume of lobes in one second (FEV 1) using lung-perfusion single-photon-emission computed tomography and CT (SPECT/CT) and the postoperative duration of chest tube drainage.
21518432:10	Subsequently, we compared data obtained from patients of the two groups.
21518432:11	Methods 
Results 
No difference in preoperative pulmonary function was found between the pleural closure and mesh-cover groups, as shown in Table . In the pleural closure group, the respective mean values of FEV 1 before and after surgery were 2.1 ± 0.6 and 1.9 ± 0.5 l, of which the mean percentage of postoperative FEV 1 was 89 ± 9%.
21518432:12	In the mesh-cover group, the respective mean values of FEV 1 before and after surgery were 2.2 ± 0.6 and 2.0 ± 0.6 l, of which the mean percentage of postoperative FEV 1 was 92 ± 8%.
21518432:13	The mean percentage of postoperative FEV 1 in the mesh-cover group was higher than that in the pleural closure group, with marginal significance ( p = 0.09).
21518432:14	In the pleural closure group, the preoperative and postoperative FEV 1 of each lobe that had undergone segmentectomy were 0.51 ± 0.20 and 0.22 ± 0.15 l, respectively, of which the mean percentage of preserved FEV 1 of the lobe was 40 ± 20%.
21518432:15	In the mesh-cover group, the preoperative and postoperative values were 0.52 ± 0.20 and 0.23 ± 0.12 l, respectively, of which the mean percentage of preserved FEV 1 of the lobe was 46 ± 24%.
21518432:16	The mean percentage of postoperative FEV 1 of the lobe was not different between the two groups.
21518432:17	Table presents the mean percentages of preserved FEV 1 of the lobe in each resected site of the two groups.
21518432:18	The pleural closure group showed a lower percentage of preserved FEV 1 than the mesh-cover group for left upper division segmentectomy, with marginal significance (21 ± 10 vs. 35 ± 15%, p = 0.06).
21518432:19	However, no significant difference in the values was found between the two groups at any other resected site, i.e., resections of one segment of the right or left upper lobe, or of an apical segment of the right or left lower lobe.
21518432:20	The FEV 1 values of the lobe before and after the upper division segmentectomy in the pleural closure group were 0.59 ± 0.21 and 0.13 ± 0.10 l, respectively, whereas the values in the mesh-cover group were, respectively, 0.47 ± 0.18 and 0.17 ± 0.10 l.
21518432:21	Multivariate analysis of the mean percentages of preserved FEV 1 of the lobe in each resected site of the two groups also showed no significant difference ( p = 0.38).
21518432:22	No significant difference was found in the respective durations of chest drainage, which were 2.0 ± 2.5 and 2.3 ± 2.2 days in the pleural closure and mesh-cover groups.
21518432:23	Discussion 
The results of this study elucidated the following points. (1) Mesh-cover is useful to preserve the pulmonary function of the residual lingular segment after the left upper division segmentectomy, although no difference was found between the mesh-cover and pleural closure methods at other resected sites.
21518432:24	(2) Covering the intersegmental plane with PGA mesh and fibrin glue can prevent postoperative air leakage as well as the pleural closure.
21518432:25	The left upper division segment corresponds to the right upper lobe and has a larger lung volume than any other segment.
21518432:26	Therefore, left upper division segmentectomy should be regarded as an exceptional procedure in segmentectomy for the preservation of pulmonary function.
21518432:27	On the other hand, the left lingular segment corresponds to the right middle lobe and has smaller lung volume than the upper division segment, i.e. the upper division has six subsegments and the lingular segment has only four.
21518432:28	This study showed that pleural closure in the upper division segmentectomy was associated with lower FEV 1 of the remaining lingular segment more than the mesh-cover method, although no difference between the two methods was found at other segmentectomy sites.
21518432:29	The following reasons might explain this outcome.
21518432:30	(1) The remaining left lingular segment after left upper division segmentectomy has little lung volume, similar to the corresponding right middle lobe.
21518432:31	(2) The functional volume of the lingular segment is likely to be decreased after left upper division segmentectomy because of the excessive upward bending and rotation of the lingular bronchus, similar to the occurrence of right middle lobe syndrome after right upper lobectomy . (3) For these two reasons, pleural closure of the remained lingular segment shrink it and further decrease of the pulmonary function of the critically preserved lingular segment.
21518432:32	The left upper division segmentectomy is a popular procedure for segmentectomy.
21518432:33	Therefore, we must keep in mind that pleural closure in the left upper division segmentectomy preserves little pulmonary function of the remaining lingular segment.
21518432:34	Furthermore, because the left upper division segmentectomy decreases the postoperative pulmonary function to a greater degree than segmentectomy of other kinds , left upper division segmentectomy should be examined separately in a controlled study of postoperative pulmonary function between the lobectomy and segmentectomy.
21518432:35	Recent development of stapling devices has added a new dimension to the technique for dissecting intersegmental plane.
21518432:36	However, the present data include none related to closure of the intersegmental plane using a stapler.
21518432:37	Although the pleural closure method in this study cut the lung tissue along the inflated-deflated line and spared intersegmental veins, the stapling method do not only cut the lung tissue without recognizing the intersegmental plane but also injure the intersegmental veins, which are instrumental for venous return of the residual segments.
21518432:38	Therefore, segmental resection using a stapler will further decrease the pulmonary function of the remaining lobe, even compared to the pleural closure method described in this report.
21518432:39	The use of staple devices in the dissection of intersegmental plane for preserving pulmonary function should be further evaluated in a separate study.
21518432:40	Results reported herein demonstrate that pleural closure does not decrease pulmonary function of the preserved segments compared to the mesh-cover procedure, except for left upper division segmentectomy.
21518432:41	For left upper division segmentectomy, the intersegmental plane should be opened to preserve the pulmonary function of the residual lingular segment.
21518432:42	Furthermore, results showed that coverage of the opened intersegmental plane using the PGA mesh and fibrin glue can prevent postoperative air leakage with the same degree of beneficial effect as pleural closure.

14662906:0	Introduction 
Igμ heavy chain genes are assembled from discrete segments by V(D)J recombination, a process initiated by RAG-1 and RAG-2.
14662906:1	The joining of coding segments is random with respect to reading frame, and most primary products of V(D)J recombination are nonproductive.
14662906:2	Heavy chain gene assembly begins in pro–B cells with the formation of DJ H joints on both alleles.
14662906:3	V H to DJ H joining is then activated sequentially at the two alleles.
14662906:4	Productive assembly of a heavy chain gene and expression of an intact μ chain marks the transition from the pro–B to the pre–B cell stage of development.
14662906:5	At this developmental checkpoint, the μ chain associates with the chaperones VpreB and λ5 and is incorporated, with the accessory chains Igα and Igβ, into the pre–B cell receptor (BCR).
14662906:6	The pre-BCR signals several cellular responses, including: (a) cessation of further V H to DJ H joining, (b) increased sensitivity to IL-7, (c) cell proliferation, (d) suppression of apoptosis, (e) developmental progression, and (f) activation of rearrangement at the Igκ locus (for review see references and ).
14662906:7	The combined proliferative and antiapoptotic pre-BCR signals contribute to the expansion of Igμ-expressing clones.
14662906:8	Increased responsiveness to IL-7, by allowing proliferation and survival at diminished cytokine concentrations, may function in the positive selection of cells that have undergone productive heavy chain rearrangement and developmental progression to light chain rearrangement.
14662906:9	Although the molecular details of signaling through the pre-BCR are poorly understood, genetic approaches have identified several critical components of the signaling machinery.
14662906:10	In mice lacking Igμ, Igβ, λ5, the tyrosine kinase Syk, or the docking protein BLNK, B cell development beyond the pre–B cell stage is impaired, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the number of peripheral B cells and an increase in the proportion of B220 + CD43 + progenitor B cells in the bone marrow relative to the more mature B220 + CD43 − cells ( – ).
14662906:11	The intracellular signaling events after appearance of the pre-BCR are not clearly defined, but several lines of evidence indicate a role for phosphorylation of Igα and Igβ.
14662906:12	First, in RAG-deficient mice, cross-linking of Igβ induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Igα and Syk, as well as differentiation of pro–B cells to small pre–B cells.
14662906:13	Second, in mice lacking the membrane-bound form of Igμ, Igβ cross-linking suppresses heavy chain rearrangement and activates light chain rearrangement.
14662906:14	Third, in mice lacking the cytoplasmic domain of Igβ, development beyond the pro–B cell stage is dependent on the Igα ITAM motifs.
14662906:15	Fourth, pre-BCR cross-linking is associated with an increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated Igβ that is associated with the pre-BCR in lipid rafts.
14662906:16	The Src-related tyrosine kinases Blk, Lyn, and Fyn associate with the BCR, and current models of BCR or pre-BCR signaling propose that one or more of these Src family kinases, possibly in combination with Syk, participate in phosphorylation of the Igα and Igβ ITAM motifs (for review see reference ).
14662906:17	Blk and Lyn prefer similar consensus substrate sequences, distinct from that of Src and resembling sites in the Igα and Igβ ITAM motifs.
14662906:18	Blk, Lyn, and Fyn play functionally redundant roles in supporting the pro–B to pre–B cell transition.
14662906:19	Single or pairwise deficiencies of these or other Src-like kinases have little or no effect on early B cell development ( – ).
14662906:20	In contrast, the pro–B to pre–B cell transition is attenuated in triply mutant Blk −/− Lyn −/− Fyn −/− mice.
14662906:21	Thus, any one of these three kinases is essential for effective pre-BCR signaling.
14662906:22	Although loss of function mutations have revealed a redundant requirement for Blk, Lyn, or Fyn in B cell development, gain of function mutations, by revealing the consequences of kinase activation, would be expected to provide additional mechanistic insight.
14662906:23	To this end we asked whether a constitutively active form of Blk, the only member of the group expressed preferentially in B cells, could provide some or all of the functions associated with the pre-BCR.
14662906:24	Our results indicate that in B cell progenitors, active Blk mimics several consequences of pre-BCR signaling.
14662906:25	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
We have shown that a constitutively active form of Blk, expressed in the B lineage at a level comparable to that of the endogenous protein, effects a suite of responses normally stimulated by productive rearrangement and expression of the μ heavy chain, including: (a) increased proliferation of CD43 int B progenitor cells, (b) enhanced responsiveness of these cells to IL-7, (c) maturation as reflected by changes in phenotype, (d) suppression of V H to DJ H rearrangement, and (e) initiation of κ rearrangement.
14662906:26	IL-7 may limit expansion of B cell progenitors in the bone marrow.
14662906:27	Exogenous IL-7 provokes an overexpansion of B cell precursors, whereas in IL-7–deficient mice the transition from the pro-B to pre-B stage is partially impaired.
14662906:28	Assembly of a pre-BCR is associated with increased responsiveness to IL-7, perhaps reflecting convergence of pre-BCR and IL-7 signals at the level of MAP kinase activation.
14662906:29	A similar increase in IL-7 sensitivity was seen in progenitor B cells from Blk(Y495F) transgenic mice.
14662906:30	Increased responsiveness of pre-BCR–expressing cells to IL-7 would present a selective growth advantage when the availability of IL-7 is reduced, as may occur in some stromal microenvironments.
14662906:31	The increase in IL-7 sensitivity conferred by Blk(Y495F) may contribute to the overrepresentation of B cell progenitors and the apparent lack of selection for μ heavy chain expression observed in Blk(Y495F) transgenic mice.
14662906:32	As BP-1 is induced by IL-7, increased sensitivity to this lymphokine may in part explain the BP-1 high phenotype of B220 + CD43 int transgenic B progenitors.
14662906:33	Expression of active Blk in the B lineage of μMT/μMT or RAG-2 −/− mice advances development past the blocks induced by these deficiencies.
14662906:34	This is evident from decreased expression of CD43 and c-kit, increased expression of CD24, and appearance of BP-1, CD2, and CD22.
14662906:35	This action of Blk resembles the effects of transgenic μ heavy chain or cross-linking of Igβ, both of which support differentiation of RAG-deficient pro–B cells to pre–B cells, with concomitant down-regulation of c-kit and CD43 and increased expression of CD24 and CD2.
14662906:36	In several ways, however, Blk(Y495F) and μ heavy chain transgenes differ in the extent to which they support B cell development.
14662906:37	In the RAG-deficient setting, μ heavy chain drives the emergence of B220 + CD43 − cells ( , ), whereas active Blk supports accumulation of a B220 + CD43 int population.
14662906:38	Moreover, CD25, a marker characteristic of pre–B II cells, is acquired by RAG-deficient B progenitors upon the introduction of μ heavy chain or cross-linking of Igβ, but not in the presence of Blk(Y495F).
14662906:39	Lastly, BP-1, which is induced upon cross-linking of Igβ on RAG-deficient pro–B cells, is expressed in the predominant B progenitor population in Blk(Y495F) transgenic RAG-2 −/− mice but not in the progenitors that accumulate in μ transgenic RAG −/− animals.
14662906:40	Thus, the predominant B progenitor phenotype in Blk(Y495F) transgenic RAG-deficient animals is phenotypically identical to the B progenitor population that is expanded in recombination-competent, Blk(Y495F) transgenic mice, but less mature than the most advanced progenitors observed in μ transgenic RAG-deficient mice.
14662906:41	This distinction suggests that the pre-BCR delivers additional signals, perhaps supplied by activation of other BCR-associated kinases, which effect further developmental progression.
14662906:42	The pre-BCR stimulates κ gene rearrangement and suppresses heavy chain rearrangement.
14662906:43	A functional pre-BCR, however, is not essential for activation of light chain rearrangement, which occurs at a low level in the absence of membrane-bound μ chain or λ5.
14662906:44	Nonetheless, in bone marrow B cell precursors from μMT/μMT mice, Ig light chain gene rearrangement is attenuated and the incidence of specific DNA cleavage at the κ locus is greatly reduced.
14662906:45	Cross-linking Igβ reverses this attenuation and suppresses ongoing V(D)J rearrangement at the heavy chain locus.
14662906:46	With respect to V(D)J recombination, the effects of Blk(Y495F) in a μMT/μMT background are similar to those of Igβ cross-linking.
14662906:47	In bone marrow B lineage cells, κ rearrangement is stimulated, whereas the yield of V H to DJ H recombination intermediates is reduced.
14662906:48	The effects of the Blk(Y495F) transgene on heavy and light chain rearrangement are likely not related to increased IL-7 sensitivity, which would have been expected to promote V H to DJ H recombination and suppress κ rearrangement.
14662906:49	In the T lineage, Lck can supply functions associated with the pre-TCR, including suppression of V β to D βJ β rearrangement and promotion of TCR-α rearrangement.
14662906:50	An active Ras transgene promotes TCR-α rearrangement but fails to stimulate allelic exclusion at the TCR-β locus, suggesting that the ability of Lck to enforce allelic exclusion at the TCR-β locus is not exerted through Ras.
14662906:51	The ability of activated Ras to induce κ rearrangement in J H-deficient mice raises the possibility that Ras mediates the stimulatory effect of Blk on κ rearrangement.
14662906:52	Expression of Blk(Y495F) was associated with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Igβ and Syk, suggesting that the most proximal sequels of pre-BCR signaling are mimicked by Blk activation.
14662906:53	A comparison of gene expression in Blk(Y495F) transgenic and nontransgenic B cell progenitors was used to identify direct or indirect targets of pre-BCR signaling.
14662906:54	Fewer than 1% of expressed markers exhibited significant differences in levels of expression.
14662906:55	Of the 21 annotated genes whose expression increased in transgenic cells, markers associated with development beyond the pro-B stage were disproportionately represented (>41%), validating the expression screen and providing further evidence that active Blk promotes developmental progression.
14662906:56	A recent report demonstrates that mice triply deficient in Blk, Lyn, and Fyn suffer an attenuation of the pro–B to pre–B cell transition, accompanied by deficiencies in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCλ and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB.
14662906:57	In these animals the leakiness of the developmental block, as well as intact tyrosine phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ and Syk, may reflect the action of residual tyrosine kinases such as Hck, Fgr, and Lck.
14662906:58	In this light, our studies of Blk(Y495F) transgenic animals are consistent with and complementary to those obtained with the triple mutant mice.
14662906:59	Impaired activation of the p50-p65 NF-κB heterodimer by the pre-BCR seems unlikely to account for the developmental defect seen in animals lacking Blk, Lyn, and Fyn because B cell development is unimpaired in mice deficient in p50 or p65 (RelA; references and ).
14662906:60	NF-κB was similarly active in nontransgenic and Blk(Y495F) transgenic pro–B cells (unpublished data), although it remains possible that differences in NF-κB activity were masked by the conditions of ex vivo culture.
14662906:61	Nonetheless, differential NF-κB activity is not essential for maintaining the differences in proliferation and developmental maturity that we observed between transgenic and nontransgenic cell populations.
14662906:62	Despite their partial redundancy in supporting the pro-B to pre-B transition, the functions of Blk may differ in detail from those of other Src-related kinases expressed in B lymphoid cells.
14662906:63	For example, a constitutively active form of Lyn, unlike the Blk(Y495F) mutant, affects neither the proliferation of B progenitors nor their responsiveness to IL-7.
14662906:64	Although such differences are consistent with nonequivalent roles for Blk and other Src-related kinases in early B lymphoid development, the ability of Blk, Lyn, or Fyn to sustain B cell development in the absence of the other two kinases suggests considerable functional overlap.

20689227:0	Introduction 
All human activity depends on ATP, which is primarily synthesized via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos).
20689227:1	By analogy with glycolytic ATP synthesis, there have been many futile attempts to isolate hypothetical high-energy intermediates, such as phosphoenolpyruvate, that tightly couple respiratory energy to ATP synthesis.
20689227:2	In 1961, Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which states that in oxphos, the respiratory energy is coupled to an imaginary anisotropic “ATPase system” located in an ion-impermeable membrane (Fig. 1 of Ref.
20689227:3	) via H +/OH − flux driven by the electrochemical activity ([H +] Left/[H +] Right = 10 7 × [ATP]/[ADP]) across the membrane.
20689227:4	) At the same time, soluble ATPase, known as coupling factor 1 (F 1), was purified from mitochondria in Racker’s laboratory. ) When F 1 was bound to F 1-deficient mitochondrial membrane, respiratory energy was coupled to ATP synthesis.
20689227:5	) The author then isolated the entire ATP synthase, later called F oF 1 (Fig. 
, right), and reconstituted F oF 1 into liposomes capable of converting energy from ATP hydrolysis to that for H + flux driven by the electrochemical potential of protons across the membrane (ΔμH +), where ΔμH + = FΔψ − 2.3RTΔpH.
20689227:6	) The H + flux through F oF 1 liposomes was demonstrated first by a pH meter (Fig. 6 of Ref.
20689227:7	).
20689227:8	After the primary chemiosmotic hypothesis ) was thus partially established, ) the subunit-subunit interactions in F oF 1 during ATP synthesis became the next research target.
20689227:9	Boyer proposed a hypothetical two-subunit model of conformational energy transfer, and finally proposed the rotational hypothesis in 1981, ) based on our report on thermophilic F 1 (TF 1) subunits with ubiquitous stoichiometry α 3β 3γδε (Fig. upper left) ) and conformational changes of isolated TF 1β from β E (with an empty catalytic site) to β D or β T by binding ADP or ATP, respectively.
20689227:10	,)
The objectives of this review are to publish how achievements on thermophilic F oF 1 (TF oF 1) in Japan have advanced the primary chemiosmotic ) and rotational ) theories, and how our studies on human F oF 1 (HF oF 1) will contribute to the development of human bioenergetics.
20689227:11	To date, ligand-binding α or β subunits have only been isolated and reconstituted into αβ subcomplexes from TF 1. –) In contrast to active α 3β 3 hexamer and α 1β 1 dimer of TF 1, ) attempts to reconstitute αβ subcomplexes from E. coli F 1 (EF 1) and HF 1 in vitro has been unsuccessful.
20689227:12	However, functional complementation of yeast F 1 (YF 1) in a quintuple deletion mutant (ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔε) with genes encoding α, β, γ and ε of BF 1 strongly suggests the presence of common structure and function of HF 1 subunits.
20689227:13	) Thus, the molecular mechanisms by which rotation and catalysis are coupled were mainly elucidated by crucial experiments using TF 1 and TF o (ab 2c 10) to represent all F oF 1s. ) The rotational hypothesis ) assumes that on ATP synthesis, the eccentric central stalk (γε) connected to the c 10 ring is rotated against the α 3β 3 hexamer in the clockwise direction, as viewed from the F o side (Fig. right).
20689227:14	This rotation induces cyclic conformational changes of β in the order of β E→β D→β T→β E so as to change the affinity for nucleotides, and finally release ATP to return to β E (Fig. middle and upper right).
20689227:15	,) In fact, Walker’s X-ray crystallography of most of α 3β 3γ of BF 1 visualized the distinct conformations of β with different nucleotide occupancies (β E, β D and β T). )
The concept of F oF 1 as an H +-driven rotor (γ-c 10) and stator (δ-ab 2), rotating with a torque of 42 pN nm, was predicted in 1996 (Fig. right).
20689227:16	) The most convincing evidence of the rotational hypothesis was the direct observation of the rotation of an actin filament attached to γ against the fixed α 3β 3 hexamer by Noji ) in 1997, using the TF 1 gene.
20689227:17	) Briefly, the ATP-driven F 1 motor rotates clockwise (Fig. upper left) and the H +-driven F o motor rotates in the anticlockwise direction as viewed from the F 1 side (Fig. lower left).
20689227:18	,,) Preliminary experiments on “the 120° rotation of the c subunit oligomer” have been reported, ) but this was not sensitive to F o inhibitor and may represent the γ rotation in the F 1 portion of F oF 1.
20689227:19	In fact, crystallographic analysis of yeast F oF 1 (YF oF 1) revealed that the ring of c subunits contains 10 protomers, rather than the widely anticipated 12 (4H + per 120° rotation), and tightly connected to γδε complex.
20689227:20	) Although crystal of EF o is not available, exact experiments on TF oF 1 confirmed the c 10-ring structure (Fig. right).
20689227:21	) By using single-molecule FRET measuring the change in the distance between the subunits a and c during the rotation (see section 6.1), a 36° sequential stepping mode of the c 10-ring rotation in F oF 1 was confirmed.
20689227:22	) ATP is synthesized at the clefts between α and β by ΔμH +-driven H + flux when both motors are connected by central (γε) and peripheral stalks (ab 2δ) to the c 10-ring in TF 1 (Fig. ).
20689227:23	,,) Elucidation of primary structures of E. coli F oF 1 (EF oF 1) ) and TF oF 1, ,) and site-directed mutagenesis ,) and suppression of the lost functions ) led to refinements in the rotational hypothesis including elastic power transmission.
20689227:24	)
After the primary rotational hypothesis ) was thus partially established, ,,,) research on F oF 1 was divided into single molecular elucidation of energy transduction at the atomic level using stable TF oF 1,,) and biomedical elucidation of human F oF 1 (HF oF 1) ) at the mitochondrial ) and in vivo levels.
20689227:25	) In contrast to the single operon of bacterial F oF 1, ,,) animal F oF 1 is encoded by both nuclear DNA ,,) and mitochondrial DNA.
20689227:26	,) The primary structures of bovine F oF 1 (BF oF 1) ,) and HF oF 1,,) were sequenced, and cDNAs of the β subunits of BF 1 and HF 1, for example, were found to share 99% amino acid homology and 94% nucleotide homology (authors report in 1986 quoted in Ref.
20689227:27	).
20689227:28	Although the core structure of TF oF 1 (α 3β 3γδε + ab 2c 10) ,,) (Fig. ) was conserved in H(B)F oF 1, it is more complex due to additional 8 subunits (d, e, f, g, A6L (ATP8), OSCP and F 6, plus a natural inhibitor called IF 1) (Fig. 
) ,,); subunits δ and ε of TF 1 correspond to OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) and the δε complex in HF 1, respectively.
20689227:29	) Although mammalian δ subunit is partially homologous to ε subunit of TF 1, X-ray crystallographic data of both BF 1) and YF 1) showed that δε complex interacts with a Rossmann fold in the γ subunit, forming a foot and c 10-γ-δ-ε rotates as an ensemble central stalk (Fig. ), ,) similar to the ε subunit at the γ subunit in TF 1 (Fig. ).
20689227:30	,) In fact, the δε complex was dissociated from BF 1 by guanidine treatment as a stable heterodimer (Papageorgiou, S., and Solaini, G., 2004, PubMed abstract).
20689227:31	So called minor subunits (e, f, g and A6L) of HF o are unlikely to have a role directly in ATP synthesis, but they appear to influence oligomeric state of HF oF 1. ,) Supramolecular structures of HF oF 1 include HF oF 1 dimer ) and ATP synthasome ) composed of phosphate carrier (PIC), adenine nucleotide carrier (ANC) and HF oF 1 (Fig. ).
20689227:32	Moreover, there are tissue differences in HF oF 1, with muscle- and liver-type γ subunits in HF 1. ) The complex gene structure, ,) specific regulation systems, ,) expression and alternative splicing ,) of HF oF 1 and related regulatory genes were elucidated by recent cytoplast technology, ,) transgenic mice, ) transcriptomics ,) and proteomics.
20689227:33	,) Based on the knowledge from these extensive studies, ,,) human energetics in physiological activities ) and diseases ,) have been analyzed.
20689227:34	In this article, mechanistic studies of F oF 1, including a reconstitution study and crystallography, will be reviewed, and then, more complex mitochondrial cytobiology and human biomedical studies will be described, because mitochondrial structure, neurohormonal control, tissue-specific activity and disease are not found in bacteria.
20689227:35	Historical evaluations of contributions made by scientists in mechanistic studies are summarized in excellent reviews (Refs. and and references therein).

Genes for TF oF 1 and HF oF 1: Single operon vs. nuclear and mitochondrial genes 
Detailed genetic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis have been reported by Futai using E. coli F oF 1 (EF oF 1), as E. coli genetics are well understood.
20689227:37	,) The catalytic, structural and regulatory significance of an amino acid residue in EF 1 was elucidated by site-directed mutagenesis.
20689227:38	) However, many crucial experiments, including the planar F oF 1 bilayer ) and torque-driven ATP synthesis, ) have not been successful to date with EF oF 1, due to its fragility.
20689227:39	Thus, a special sequencing method for thermophilic genes was developed.
20689227:40	) The structure of the TF oF 1 operon (number of amino acid residues), ,) I(127)- a(210)- c(72)- b(163)- δ(163)- α(502)- γ(286)- β(473)- ε(132), was similar to that of the EF oF 1 operon.
20689227:41	,)
Amino acid residues in the different α, β, and γ subunits from TF 1, ,) HF 1, ,,) BF 1) and EF 1,) are aligned ) and expressed in the format α10, which refers to residue #10 in the α subunit.
20689227:42	The residue numbers of amino acid sequences in the α and β subunits of TF 1 are shown in Fig.
20689227:43	(dots indicate every tenth residue).
20689227:44	,) Primary structures are homologous, with 59% sequence identity between thermophilic α/human α and 68% between thermophilic β/human β. ) The primary structure of the TF 1 β subunit showed homology with 270 residues which are identical in the β subunits from HF 1, CF 1, and EF 1. ) The homologies of the amino acid sequence between BF 1 and YF 1 were 73%, 79% and 40%, respectively, for the α, β and γ subunits.
20689227:45	) As these YF 1 subunits were functionally complemented with corresponding BF 1 subunits, ) the essential structure is conserved among YF 1, BF 1 and HF 1 (sequence is nearly identical to that of BF 1, but there were polymorphisms in HF 1). ) Residues forming reverse turns (Gly and Pro) were highly conserved among the β subunits.
20689227:46	) Conserved residues (green and blue letters in Fig.
20689227:47	) among TF 1, HF 1 and EF 1 are closely related to catalytic and regulatory functions.
20689227:48	,,) The observed substitutions in the thermophilic subunit increased its propensities to form secondary structures, and its external polarity to form tertiary structure.
20689227:49	)
Chemical and genetic modification of residues in F 1 revealed a nucleotide-binding P-loop (-GGAGVGKT-; thermophilic β158–165 corresponds to bovine β156–163) (Figs.
20689227:50	A
).
20689227:51	,,,,) Long before the X-ray crystallographic elucidation of the P-loop, ) site-directed mutagenesis of the TF 1 gene ) to induce thermophilic βK164I and thermophilic αK175I, identified an essential role for lysine residues in the catalysis (Fig.
20689227:52	A, red letters).
20689227:53	) The proton abstracting thermophilic βE190 (Fig.
20689227:54	A) localized in the GER-loop (-VGER-) (Fig. ) ,,) was also predicted by TF 1 mutagenesis producing thermophilic βE190Q.
20689227:55	) These mutant TF 1 subunits produced an α 3β 3γ complex that was suitable for experiments on torque-driven ATP synthesis.
20689227:56	) Species-specific residues (black letters in Fig.
20689227:57	) may have phylogenic components, including thermophilic loops (-ARNENEV-) (Fig. first line I′) that render TF 1 stable. ) Since determining the nucleotide sequence of TF oF 1, ,,) numerous rotating ATP synthases of thermophilic F-type or V-type (vacuolar ATPase) have been sequence and characterized.
20689227:58	,)
In contrast to the single operon TF oF 1, the gene structure of HF oF 1 is highly complex ,,); most subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA, with signal peptides to target this protein to the mitochondrial inner membrane, ,,) but subunits a and A6L of HF o are encoded by mitochondrial DNA.
20689227:59	,) The complete sequence of the 16,569-base pair human mitochondrial DNA contains genes for 12S and 16S rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, ATPase subunits 6 (corresponding to the a subunit of HF o) and 8 (corresponds to A6L of HF o), and 11 other protein coding genes.

Crystallographic analysis of F oF 1: Detailed structure of H +-driven and ATP-driven motors 
Nanotechnological analysis of TF oF 1 by single-molecule imaging: Dynamic movement of F oF 1
X-ray crystallography of F 1 and F oF 1 is a static snapshot of inhibited ATPase crystallized in the presence of AMPPNP ) or BeF 3, ) or in the absence of nucleotides.
20689227:61	,) These crystals do not represent the transient movement of subunits of TF 1 during γ-rotation, or activity of TF oF 1 in a liposome.
20689227:62	,,) Thus, the dynamics of rotating TF 1) or ATP synthesis in F oF 1-liposomes ) must be measured by using TF 1 containing mutant β subunits, ) and also using modalities such as fluorometry ,) or NMR.
20689227:63	)
The efficiency of florescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor and an acceptor fluorophore depends on their distance.
20689227:64	,,) If two fluorophores are bound to appropriate amino acid residues in rotor and stator subunits, relative subunit movements can be observed in real time by confocal microscopy.
20689227:65	,,)
Biogenesis of human F oF 1: Regulated expression, splicing, import and assembly 
The biogenesis of HF oF 1 is an intricate process, ) starting from transcription, –) splicing of nuclear encoded subunits (Fig. 
), ,) and translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits (Fig. 
) ,,) and nuclear DNA-encoded precursor peptides for all F 1 subunits (α, β, γ, δ and ε) ,) and 7 F o subunits (b, c, d, e, f, g and OSCP), ) followed by targeting, importing and processing of nuclear DNA-encoded precursor peptides in the mitochondrion (Fig. 
).
20689227:66	,) Precursor importing requires both ΔμH + to drive translocation and specific carrier proteins in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane, as well as general chaperones present in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix.
20689227:67	) Processing of the presequence of precursor requires a specific protease, ) and after the removal of the presequence, nuclear-encoded subunits are assembled into HF oF 1 with two mtDNA-encoded F o subunits (a and A6L).
20689227:68	) Targeting the presequence of three isoforms of subunit c liberated after proteolysis is required for the assembly of cytochrome oxidase.
20689227:69	)
As both the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of subunits in HF oF 1 are available in internet databases, only physiologically important points in the biogenesis of HF oF 1 will be reviewed here.
20689227:70	,,,) In contrast to prokaryotic F oF 1, including TF oF 1, ) proteomics have revealed a large universe of pseudogene products, ,) splice variants (muscle-type F 1γ) (Fig. ), ,,) post-translational modifications (phosphorylated HF oF 1, etc. ), ) dimeric HF oF 1, ) a supramolecular complex called ATP synthasome (Fig. ), ) and ectopic HF oF 1 (Fig. 
, right).
20689227:71	)
Mitochondrial cytology of HF oF 1: cytoplasts lack nDNA and ρ o cells lack mtDNA 
HF oF 1 is encoded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ,,) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) (Fig. ).
20689227:72	,) In order to analyze the roles played by mtDNA and nDNA, mtDNA-less cells (ρ o cells) ,) and nDNA-less cells (cytoplasts) were developed (Fig. ).
20689227:73	,) Using ethidium bromide, mtDNA was removed and the resulting ρ o cells became strictly dependent on glycolysis to compensate for the oxphos that supplies ATP.
20689227:74	,) Thus, a glucose medium is essential for ρ o cells.
20689227:75	) Cytoplasts are enucleated cells that contain mitochondria (Fig. upper left), with examples being enucleated oocytes, ) synaptosomes ) and platelets.
20689227:76	) Since DNA sequence of an individual differs from each other owing to the genetic polymorphism of mtDNA, ) personal collection of mtDNA is essential to elucidate mitochondrial diseases.
20689227:77	Human mitochondria with intact mtDNA have been directly isolated from postmortem platelets.
20689227:78	) Expression of nDNA-encoded HF oF 1 subunits was not affected in ρ o cells, ) while that of mtDNA-encoded HF o subunits (F oa and A6L) was lost in cytoplasts, as nDNA-encoded mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) ) was lacking (Fig. ). ) The ρ 0 cells have no respiratory chain, because of the loss of mtDNA-encoded subunits of cytochromes and NADH dehydrogenase.
20689227:79	,) Despite the absence of oxphos, ρ o cells require mitochondrial compartments with a sufficient ΔμH + for energy driven transport of matrix components.
20689227:80	,) The essential ΔμH + of ρ o cells is maintained by the electrogenic exchange of ATP 4− for ADP 3− by ANC.
20689227:81	) To energize the inner membrane, α 3β 3 (ATPase active) ) in the matrix of ρ o cells regenerates ADP from translocated ATP.
20689227:82	)
The term heteroplasmy refers to cells that contain a mixture of mtDNAs with different sequences (Fig. upper right), whereas homoplasmy means that 100% of their mtDNA has an identical sequence (Fig. upper left).
20689227:83	,) Cybrids were formed by cytoplast fusion with ρ o cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Fig. bottom).
20689227:84	,) The majority of pathogenic mtDNA mutations are heteroplasmic, with mutated and wild-type mtDNA coexisting in the same cell (Fig. upper right).
20689227:85	,) Owing to the absence of protecting histones, mtDNA is highly susceptible to mutations that result in heteroplasmy.
20689227:86	Mutations in the tRNA gene of mtDNA often block translation and cause complete deletion of mtDNA-encoded proteins ( syn − mutation), including HF o subunits.
20689227:87	)
During development, cell division unevenly distributes heteroplasmic mtDNA into daughter cells and eventually segregates homoplasmic cells with wild-type and syn − mutant mtDNA (Fig. bottom right).
20689227:88	This stochastic segregation of the syn − mutation results in the syn − mutant concentrated tissues and causes mitochondrial diseases, including mitochondrial diabetes.
20689227:89	) The homoplasmic syn − cells lack oxphos and depend on glycolysis.
20689227:90	Under the influence of polymorphisms in mtDNA and nDNA, a vicious circle of reactive oxygen species will damage cells.
20689227:91	However, mitochondrial transfer from wild-type homoplasmic cytoplasts by fusion to form cybrids will normalize the diseased cells ) and syn − mutation will be alleviated by mitochondrial fusion.
20689227:92	,) We analyzed heteroplasmy and polymorphisms related to diabetes and its complementation by mitofusins.
20689227:93	) Mitochondria in human cells are visualized as a network or as filaments that undergo continuous changes in shape and in localization within the cells.
20689227:94	Mitochondrial fusion proteins including mitofusins ) and OPA1 ) that may work as natural PEG in Fig.
20689227:95	) and regulate both mitochondrial fusion and metabolism.
20689227:96	We characterized splice variants of human mitofusins (also called hfzo 1, 2 and 3) ) as well as OPA1s (Fig. upper right).
20689227:97	) We analyzed complementation by fusogenic proteins, and the lost tRNA in mitochondria of syn − mtDNA inside heteroplasmic cells was complemented by wild-type tRNA in normal mitochondria by fusing wild-type and syn − mitochondria with mitofusins.
20689227:98	) The mitofusin genes were expressed mainly in post-mitotic brain and muscle, thus complementing mutated mtDNA that is not removed during cell division.
20689227:99	)
In order to analyze a mitochondrial disease, pure nuclear transfer was carried out from ρ 0 HeLa cells to the fibroblast lines from a patient with cardiomyopathy, and their nuclear hybrid clones were isolated.
20689227:100	) A normal fibroblast line from the fetus and a respiration-deficient fibroblast line from the patient were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
20689227:101	) By this method, many mitochondrial diseases devoid of HF o have been elucidated ) and mitochondrial gene therapy for heteroplasmic patients was developed using cytoplasts from a normal fetal cells and the cybrids (Fig. ). )
The most frequent mutation in mtDNA-encoded HF o gene is NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa), caused by a mutation at L156 in the a subunit of HF o (Fig. ). ) A mutation conferring a milder phenotype (L156P) leads to a 30% reduction in H + flux, and a similar loss in ATP synthesis.
20689227:102	The more severe mutation (L156R) also leads to a 30% reduction in H + flux, but ATP synthesis is abolished.
20689227:103	) With the L156P mutation, rotation of the c-ring may be slowed, but coupling of ATP synthesis to H + flux is maintained (Fig. lower left, subunit a), whereas with the L156R mutation, H + flux is uncoupled, because the transmembrane helix III of F oa is unable to span the membrane.
20689227:104	The L156R mutant has ATPase activity, ) because the α 3β 3 complex portion of F 1 is intact, and increased proton permeability through the defective F o cannot maintain ΔμH + to inhibit ATP-driven H + translocation ( i.e. uncoupling).
20689227:105	,)
Supramolecular structure of HF oF 1: Dimeric HF oF 1, ATP synthasome and ecto-HF oF 1
Mitochondrial F oF 1, including HF oF 1, is typically isolated as a monomeric complex that contains 16 protein subunits ) and the natural inhibitor protein (IF 1) (Fig. ). ) However, mitochondrial F oF 1 was isolated in dimeric and higher oligomeric states using digitonin for one step mild solubilization followed by blue native (BN) or clear native (CN) electrophoresis.
20689227:106	) Recent developments in proteomics have revealed HF oF 1 in its natural supramolecular state.
20689227:107	,,) Single bands in the gel can be analyzed by proteomics approaches including immunoprecipitation, ) and mass spectrometry to identify the amino acid sequence of the components.
20689227:108	) Electron microscopy of these oligomeric mitochondrial F oF 1 particles was reported in 1972 (Fig.
20689227:109	C in Ref.
20689227:110	).
20689227:111	Dimeric and trimeric F oF 1 were purified from mammalian mitochondria in five different tissues by BN electrophoresis and CN electrophoresis, ,) and these were active, thus suggesting that oligomeric F oF 1 is constitutive in mitochondria.
20689227:112	Using BN electrophoresis, two membrane proteins (6.8 kDa proteolipid and diabetes-associated protein) that had previously been removed during purification were shown to be stoichiometrically associated with F oF 1, ) and this may provide insight for further functional investigations.
20689227:113	)
In situ mitochondrial ΔμH + was directly estimated by rhodamine 123, which is accumulated in mitochondria depending on ΔμH +. ) The futile ATP hydrolytic activity of HF oF 1 during ischemia that lowers ΔμH +, is prevented by IF 1. ) Bovine IF 1 is an α-helical dimer and residues 1–37 of IF 1 open the catalytic interface between α D–β D. ) Atomic force microscopy images show how these F oF 1 molecules form dimers with a characteristic 15-nm distance between the axes of their rotors through stereo-specific interactions of the membrane-embedded portions of their stators.
20689227:114	) A different interaction surface is responsible for the formation of rows of oligomers, suggesting the role of subunits e and g of HF o in dimerization.
20689227:115	) Some dimers have a different morphology, with a 10-nm stalk-to-stalk distance, in line with F oF 1s, which are thus accessible to IF 1. ) Dimeric or polymeric HF oF 1 is related to morphology of cristae ) under the influence of OPA1.
20689227:116	)
A channel protein, porin, is now known as VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) and is the most abundant protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane.
20689227:117	) VDAC helps ATP/ADP exchange by forming a complex with ANC (ANC–VDAC complex).
20689227:118	) Finally, a supramolecular structure called ATP synthasome composed of F oF 1, ANC, PIC and perhaps VDAC was isolated and characterized (Fig. ). ) Parallel immuno-electron microscopic studies revealed the presence of PIC and ANC located non-centrally in the basepiece, and other studies indicated an ATP synthase/PIC/ANC stoichiometry near 1:1:1 (Fig. ). ) Collectively, these findings support a mechanism in which the entry of the substrates ADP and Pi into mitochondria, the synthesis of ATP on HF oF 1, and the release and exit of ATP are localized in a supramolecular structure in a highly coordinated system.
20689227:119	In vivo ATP synthesis: F oF 1 in human bioenergetics and diseases 
The function and survival of all organisms is dependent on the dynamic control of energy metabolism.
20689227:120	Energy demand is matched to ATP supply by F oF 1 and glycolysis (Fig. bottom).
20689227:121	,) The increase in ADP + Pi produced by ATP consumption results in the instant ΔμH +-driven ATP synthesis by F oF 1 and increases in electron transport activity to compensate ΔμH + (respiratory control).
20689227:122	The increase in ADP is amplified as AMP increase by myokinase reaction (2ADP = ATP + AMP).
20689227:123	If ATP synthesis by F oF 1 is not enough, especially when oxygen supply is limited by high metabolic equivalents (METs >5), increased AMP/ATP ratio activates phosphofructokinase to compensate ATP by glycolysis.
20689227:124	Although the regulatory mechanism of TF oF 1 is basically ubiquitous, ,) HF oF 1 is specialized for human activity.
20689227:125	One of the characteristics of HF oF 1 among other F oF 1s is genetic polymorphisms during evolution, particularly in mtDNA, ,) that cause ethnic and interindividual differences in physical activity, aging and disease susceptibility.
20689227:126	,) Voluntary will of the brain triggers muscle contraction and other organ specific activities that consume about 50 kg of ATP per day, but METs change from 0.9 to 15 in a normal adult (Fig. right).
20689227:127	Direct measurement of in vivo HF oF 1 activity and AMP/ATP ratio is possible by using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that ATP synthase flux correlated with O 2 uptake (METs) and insulin sensitivity.
20689227:128	) The increase in METs is mainly caused by actomyosin contraction (Fig. right), and muscle-specific γ subunit splice variants of HF oF 1 are seen during myogenesis and cardiogenesis (Fig. ).
20689227:129	,) The resulting change in substrates to increase lactic acid can be assessed by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
20689227:130	) Lactic acidemia is present not only in individuals undergoing high MET exercise, but also in the majority of patients with mitochondrial disorders, including impaired HF o, and cells isolated from such patients, similarly to ρ 0 cells, require glucose medium (Fig. ).
20689227:131	,) Mitochondrial disorders can be due to defects in nDNA directly affecting the assembly or function of HF oF 1 and respiratory chain, defects in mtDNA affecting HF o and the respiratory chain or nDNA influencing mtDNA structure and viability.
20689227:132	,)
The regulatory mechanism of HF oF 1 including four independent inhibitory sites ) are more complex than those of TF oF 1. ,) AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activates both oxphos and glycolysis, functioning as a ‘fuel gauge’ to monitor AMP/ATP ratio (Fig. left).
20689227:133	) ATP-sensitive K + channels both in the plasma membrane and in mitochondria also monitors ATP levels to regulate cellular activities.
20689227:134	,) Increases in ATP concentration close the K + channel, and the resulting depolarization opens L-type Ca 2+ channels (Fig. bottom).
20689227:135	Increased intracellular Ca 2+ activates many metabolic processes and proteins for mitochondrial dynamics and secretion.
20689227:136	For example, in the β-cells of mitochondrial myopathy, ATP-sensitive K + channels are not closed and defective Ca 2+-dependent insulin secretion results in mitochondrial diabetes.
20689227:137	) Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K + channels regulate energy transfer through their regulation of intermembrane space volume and are accordingly essential for the inotropic response during periods of high METs.
20689227:138	) Although the target residues in HF oF 1 and their signal routes have not yet been determined, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K + channels are closely related to kinases including protein kinase Cε. ) In fact, detailed proteomics have revealed, for example, phosphorylation of αS76, βT213, βS529, γY44 or γY52, and acetylation of αK132, βK133, γK79 in mammalian F oF 1. ) The monomeric form of HF oF 1 contains a phosphorylated γ (γY52) that is not present in the dimeric form.
20689227:139	)
In contrast to bacteria, ATP synthesis by HF oF 1 requires exchange of Pi + ADP and ATP between cytosol and mitochondria by PIC and ANC, which are organized as the ATP synthasome (Fig. ). ) VDAC ) forming a complex with ANC also plays an important role in cytoplasma-mitocondrial communication.
20689227:140	) As mammalian cells are about 1000 times as large as bacteria, and a mitochondrion is as large as a bacterium, mitochondrial dynamics are essential to distribute synthesized ATP (Fig. upper left).

19841042:0	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
A total of 2,397 participants, corresponding to the first half of Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) enrollees, completed the Look AHEAD food frequency questionnaire (LA-FFQ).
19841042:1	Look AHEAD is a multicenter randomized trial in overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, investigating the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention–induced weight loss on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
19841042:2	Eligibility criteria included BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 (≥27 kg/m 2 if on insulin), age 45–76 years, A1C <11%, blood pressure ≤160/100 mmHg, and fasting triglycerides ≤600 mg/dl.
19841042:3	The LA-FFQ and its analysis were previously described.
19841042:4	Eight line items inquire about seafood consumption.
19841042:5	mO-3FA intake was estimated by adding eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid intake from the LA-FFQ.
19841042:6	RESULTS 
Participant baseline characteristics do not differ from those of the overall Look AHEAD sample with respect to sex, race/ethnicity, adiposity, or fitness.
19841042:7	Age criteria change during the second year of study recruitment resulted in a slightly younger age in our subgroup (see Table S1, available in an online appendix at ).
19841042:8	CONCLUSIONS 
Look AHEAD offers a large sample of individuals with diabetes in whom a validated tool was used to estimate usual mO-3FA intake.
19841042:9	mO-3FA consumption was found to be very low.
19841042:10	An intake of ≥1,000 mg/day is recommended for people with diabetes ( – ).
19841042:11	Despite the low levels, mO-3FA consumption was associated with lower triglycerides and with a trend for higher HDL.
19841042:12	The relationship between mO-3FAs and each of HDL and triglycerides was independent of adiposity, fitness, lipid medications (including fibrates), glycemic control, and dietary variables that affect lipid levels, such as carbohydrate, fiber, and saturated fat.
19841042:13	Likewise, the intake of linolenic acid, a precursor of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, and consumption of its metabolic competitor linoleic acid, did not alter the relationship between mO-3FA intake and HDL and triglycerides.
19841042:14	Contrary to reports with high-dose mO-3FA, we did not find an unfavorable association between mO-3FA consumption and LDL cholesterol or glucose control.
19841042:15	These findings encourage future outcome studies in individuals with diabetes evaluating lower intakes of mO-3FA than those previously investigated.
19841042:16	A large trial with eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation in high-risk subjects found the greatest reduction in cardiovascular events in the subgroup with lower HDL and higher triglycerides, raising the possibility that mO-3FA may be of a particular benefit in individuals with diabetes, who characteristically display this lipid profile.
19841042:17	The race/ethnicity differences in mO-3FA consumption and the question of whether specific groups might specifically benefit from interventions that increase mO-3FA intake are worthy of further study.
19841042:18	The decrease in mO-3FAs with intensive lifestyle intervention is not surprising given that the Look AHEAD intervention was not targeted at increasing mO-3FA intake.
19841042:19	The decrease in mO-3FA intake paralleled a reduction in fried/sandwich fish intake, which is considered favorable.
19841042:20	Our results should be interpreted with caution.
19841042:21	Look AHEAD did not evaluate supplement use and is subject to the limitations of information obtained by self-report.
19841042:22	The favorable association between usual dietary mO-3FA intake and lipids at baseline encourages future research on the potential benefit of increasing consumption of mO-3FAs, in addition to modifying fish type, when planning lifestyle interventions for weight loss in individuals with diabetes.
20421984:0	Introduction 
The International HapMap Project was designed to create a genome-wide database of human genetic variation, with the expectation that these data would be useful for genetic association studies of common diseases.
20421984:1	This expectation has been fulfilled with just the initial output of genome-wide association analyses, identifying nearly 500 loci for over 80 common diseases and traits . Despite these successes, it has become clear that usually only a small percentage of total genetic heritability estimates can be explained by the identified loci.
20421984:2	For instance, for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 32 loci significantly impact disease but they explain only 10% of disease risk and 20% of genetic risk . This may be attributed to the fact that recent findings show many types of genetic associations for various traits, with subtle effects: non-additive genetic effects, non-SNP polymorphisms, epigenetic effects, but also gene-environment and gene-gene interactions .
20421984:3	The role of genetic interactions in explaining phenotypic variability has been described in several publications , , , , . Interactions may lead to inconsistent results from the masking of associations, they can be suggestive of important pathogenic mechanisms and may elucidate relevant opportunities for intervention . Epistasis, defined as the deviation from additivity of effects observed at multiple genetic exposures , may also explain part of the genetic heritability that is left unexplained for most complex disorders . These reasons have made epistasis an increasingly accepted characteristic of the genetic architecture of common, complex disorders , .
20421984:4	One of the potential reasons for the small number of large-scale genetic interaction studies performed in humans so far is that although genetic interactions identified from model organisms provide insight into biological processes, these biological processes often lack sufficient overlap with other types of gene/protein associations with traits of interest .
20421984:5	Also, the relatively low success rate of large-scale epistasis searches to date may simply reflect the limited ability to assess the many possible modes of interaction, including pairwise interactions and threshold effects or inadequate solutions given to a difficult statistical challenge . In addition, subtle variation in allele frequency can either introduce an interaction effect and likewise remove an interaction effect from a particular dataset; this can make detection of epistasis effects quite challenging . Overviews of methods for epistasis detection were given by Cordell and by Onkamo and Toivonen .
20421984:6	One non-parametric approach developed for epistasis analysis is Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction , (MDR).
20421984:7	Since its conception, many methodological and applied papers have emerged that build on or use MDR.
20421984:8	To our knowledge, the current state-of-the-art MDR-related method that can accommodate nuclear families of any size and different types of outcome variables is the recently proposed Pedigree-based Generalized MDR method (PGMDR) which generalizes the Generalized MDR method (GMDR) to family data.
20421984:9	Its competitor, the MDR Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (MDR-PDT), is only suited for case-control data and does not allow for covariate adjustments.
20421984:10	Similar to MDR, GMDR uses prediction accuracy measures for best model selection.
20421984:11	Significance assessment is based on random permutations.
20421984:12	To easily accommodate continuous traits and variable adjustments, GMDR is based on scores of a (generalized) linear model.
20421984:13	In the special case of no covariates and a binary outcome it reduces to the classical MDR.
20421984:14	PGMDR first constructs a non-transmitted genotype for every non-founder in the pedigree.
20421984:15	When parental genotype information is missing, PGMDR samples one realization of the nontransmitted genotype from the conditional distribution given the minimal sufficient statistic for the null hypothesis through an algorithm that is modified from Rabinowitz and Laird . Second, the non-founders and the non-transmitted genotypes are analyzed by the GMDR algorithm.
20421984:16	Significance assessment is again based on permutations.
20421984:17	To maintain the correlation structure within the families, families as a whole are used as permuting units and the transmitted and non-transmitted sets in a whole family are randomly shuffled.
20421984:18	PGMDR software is available from the URL . 
The need for new statistical methods to overcome some of the remaining statistical hurdles in epistasis detection, has led to the development of FAM-MDR.
20421984:19	The method combines features of the GRAMMAR approach with features of Model-based MDR (MB-MDR).
20421984:20	In the section, we introduce the FAM-MDR algorithm and describe our extensive simulation study to examine type I error and power of this approach.
20421984:21	To examine the application of FAM-MDR to determine epistasis in family studies of a complex disease, we examined data on glucose area-under-the-curve (GAUC), an endophenotype of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) for which multiple independent genetic associations have been observed, in the extended pedigrees of the Amish Family Diabetes Study (AFDS).
20421984:22	Subsequently, we describe the power and type I error performance of FAM-MDR in our simulations and application to AFDS, as well as a comparative study between FAM-MDR and PGDMR, in the section.
20421984:23	Finally, the elaborates on the significance of our results, and the relevance of its application to finding gene-gene interactions in a complex disease like T2DM.

Results 
Discussion 
The objectives of this paper were to introduce a new family-based and flexible epistasis detection analysis method, FAM-MDR, which is based on multifactor dimensionality reduction of multi-locus genotypes, and to compare it to the current state-of-the art MDR methodology for families, PGMDR.
20421984:25	Although principles of the initial MDR approach are adopted in FAM-MDR, there are some clear differences.
20421984:26	These include an alternative way to identify risk categories associated with multi-locus genotypes, the flexibility to use any outcome type, the possibility to correct for lower order effects, covariates or confounding factors, the possibility to assess significance of multiple higher-order interaction models.
20421984:27	Since model selection is not based on evaluating prediction accuracy but on testing associations, FAM-MDR does not involve computationally intensive cross-validation steps.
20421984:28	FAM-MDR consists of two parts.
20421984:29	In part I, residuals are derived from a polygenic model, removing additive polygenic effects and possibly important lower-order effects or confounding factors.
20421984:30	These residuals are subsequently considered as new traits for the second part of FAM-MDR.
20421984:31	In Part II, the familial correlation-free residuals are submitted to the MB-MDR algorithm and either the best model (considered in this manuscript), or multiple epistasis models are checked for their significance.
20421984:32	In contrary to first implementations of the MB-MDR algorithm, no simulation-based null distributions are derived to assess significance, but a permutation-based strategy is adopted.
20421984:33	Under the assumption of familial correlation-free traits in FAM-MDR Part II, permutation-based p-values for the best model can easily be derived by randomly permuting the traits.
20421984:34	This is in contrast to PGMDR's implementation of a permutation strategy in that for PGDMR families are considered as the permutation units.
20421984:35	The method of removing familial-correlation structure is not new.
20421984:36	The GRAMMAR approach of Aulchenko et al. and Amin et al. also used this idea in the context of rapid genomewide main effects analysis.
20421984:37	For multivariate traits and unrelated individuals, similar principles of first removing trait correlations and then submitting derived residuals to MB-MDR can be adopted.
20421984:38	This is work in progress and is particularly useful when measurements over time are available.
20421984:39	Exploiting the time-relatedness of phenotypic measurements may in part compensate for the large sample sizes needed to detect epistasis in genomic studies.
20421984:40	The Current implementation of FAM-MDR is not scalable to GWAS.
20421984:41	An efficient C++ implementation and a code version for parallel analyses are on their way.
20421984:42	First simulations indicate that these enhancements will make GWAS feasible.
20421984:43	For now, when large-scale genomic screenings are performed with thousands of markers, since FAM-MDR Part I is preparatory for subsequent association analysis, FAM-MDR can include a pre-selection step of good candidates of markers for epistasis analysis.
20421984:44	These candidates may be selected on the basis of information theoretic measures using information about the trait under investigation; or on the basis of evidence from other data, i.e. using external and independent information e.g. omics analyses.
20421984:45	Depending on the strategy, an additional correction for data snooping in the pre-screening step may be required to control type I error rates.
20421984:46	Also, a Part III can be added to a FAM-MDR analysis to interpret the identified epistasis models.
20421984:47	This is an important step of the analysis and may or may not involve deriving good estimates of the significant effects.
20421984:48	Special care needs to be taken when carrying out this step, in order not to be the victim of the so-called “winner's curse” . 
Currently, MB-MDR and FAM-MDR are based on Wald statistics, whereas GMDR and PGMDR make use of score statistics.
20421984:49	First, the score test is computationally more advantageous because it only needs parameter estimates under the null whereas the Wald test needs parameter estimates under the alternative and the likelihood ratio test needs both.
20421984:50	Second, even though the three tests are asymptotically equivalent, the score test is the most powerful of the three when the true parameter is close to the null value.
20421984:51	In line with the first release of an MB-MDR R package for unrelated individuals, Wald statistics were implemented in the first version of the FAM-MDR software.
20421984:52	In the future, score statistics as well as robust non-parametric statistics will be offered as additional options in FAM-MDR.
20421984:53	One of the major results that our simulation study highlights is that PGMDR is too liberal in identifying epistasis models.
20421984:54	This is due to the inadequate correction for multiple testing, implemented in the PGDMR software to date ( ; Panel C).
20421984:55	In contrast, FAM-MDR correctly deals with multiple testing and consequently leads to appropriate type I error rates ( ; Panel A).
20421984:56	In effect, FAM-MDR is rather conservative, which is a property inherited from the GRAMMAR approach it is built on.
20421984:57	Indeed, while first removing polygenic effects (FAM-MDR Part I), an over-correction may take place, resulting in power loss and conservatism to identify remaining genetic association signals.
20421984:58	Improvements to FAM-MDR that can remove this artifact are on the way.
20421984:59	A second result is that, generally speaking, FAM-MDR has optimal power over PGMDR in virtual all considered simulation scenarios.
20421984:60	In addition, we have indicated that occasional better achieved performance of PGMDR in terms of power is probably attributable to sampling variability.
20421984:61	Also note that when computing the PGMDR power estimates in our simulation study, in case of a tie we gave advantage to the model with the functional SNP pair.
20421984:62	A third important result is the influence of correcting for lower-order effects when searching for significant epistatic interactions.
20421984:63	As was also pointed out by Calle et al. MDR-like analysis that does not account for important marginal effects is prone to report false higher-order interactions, containing the significant lower-order effects not accounted for.
20421984:64	Although PGMDR accommodates covariate adjustment, more work is needed to enhance flexible implementation.
20421984:65	FAM-MDR code is currently available as an R-script, in which covariate adjustments are easily incorporated in the model statement of the polygenic function.
20421984:66	More work is needed though to develop a genuine screening strategy to search for optimal models, starting from important main effects and ending with higher-order interaction models beyond the two-way interactions considered in this work, with the maximum order pre-defined by the user.
20421984:67	This is future research, since our simulations have shown that it is of utmost importance to adjust for previous significant findings when moving to the search space of interactions of the next order.
20421984:68	Since the way lower-order interactions are accounted for is part of a parametric paradigm, the coding of these effects needs careful reflection.
20421984:69	When lower-order effects are important, a correction is warranted.
20421984:70	When lower-order effects are not important or not adequately coded, over-adjusting for lower-order effects may lead to there being virtually no variation left with which to identify higher-order interactions.
20421984:71	Hence, in reality the balance between necessary corrections for important main effects and avoiding over-correction needs to be considered to optimize the performance of any epistasis detection method.
20421984:72	The current FAM-MDR implementation is only valid under the assumption of no population structure, and our simulations assume a homogeneous population.
20421984:73	By using both between- and within-family association – in contrast to PGMDR that uses only within-family association – FAM-MDR gains power but this comes at the price of sacrificing the built-in protection against spurious results if population structure is present.
20421984:74	A possible solution to this problem lies in the use of Genomic Control .
20421984:75	Although PGMDR is a flexible tool to handle binary or continuous outcome types, and accommodates covariate adjustment, our application to real-life data has revealed some important shortcomings that impact the power of a study.
20421984:76	These include a rather inefficient use of available information and the inability to analyze complex and extended pedigrees with the present PGMDR implementation.
20421984:77	Regarding missing genotypes, PGMDR discards families entirely when data on one SNP are missing.
20421984:78	Without minimizing the need to also improve FAM-MDR's handling of missing data (whether at the genotype or phenotype level), not being able to account for the full complexity of a pedigree is certainly a drawback of PGMDR.
20421984:79	We believe that methods that can accommodate mixed study designs will become more and more important due to the increasing practice of combining data from different groups in consortia collaborations.
20421984:80	FAM-MDR flexibly deals with both unrelated and related individuals in the same analysis whereas PGMDR excludes unrelated individuals, hereby reducing the power of the association analysis.
20421984:81	Multi-generational pedigrees may provide more information on inheritance patterns observed on genotype data, which improves the quality of family-based tests of association.
20421984:82	Due to limitations of the PGMDR software, only FAM-MDR analysis was applied to the extended pedigree data as such.
20421984:83	With (or without) FAM-MDR correction for main effects of rs1884614 in HNF4A rs2275703 and rs617698 in CASQ1 and rs1029629 in ADIPOR2 no evidence for a significant interaction (or two-locus model) was found.
20421984:84	Weak interactions between variations at these loci in contributing to the phenotype may still exist, but if so, FAM-MDR was not able to identify them.
20421984:85	In this context it is important to note that FAM-MDR – like GRAMMAR – could be rather conservative, especially for larger extended pedigrees . On the other hand, the (nearly) significant findings for the simplified pedigree may potentially be false positive results driven by both the artificial increase in sample size and by not appropriately accounting for family structure.
20421984:86	Indeed, McArdle et al. showed that the type I error of detecting SNP main effects is elevated when family structure is ignored, and more dramatically with increasing trait heritability, which may naturally extend to (interactive) two-locus models as well.
20421984:87	Lack of appropriate accounting for multiple testing (PGMDR and FAM-MDR*) may also increase the likelihood of observing spurious associations.
20421984:88	This is clearly seen for FAM-MDR* and to some extent also for PGMDR.
20421984:89	Improving the ability to detect gene-gene interactions in family studies of complex disease may prove critical in identifying the underlying sources of observed heritability.
20421984:90	While it is apparent that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is polygenic, the genetic sources of the observed heritability have yet to be completely identified and may include still unobserved gene-gene interactions.
20421984:91	Detecting interactions between genes associated with T2DM has thus far been very challenging, due to a paucity of powerful statistical methods and study datasets with adequate sample sizes . Several studies that have examined interactions between single variants in different genes have shown mixed evidence of two-way interactions in T2DM and T2DM-related traits like obesity and insulin resistance.
20421984:92	Using an approach which conditioned on linkage in one region to identify evidence of linkage elsewhere, a linkage study of T2DM in Mexican Americans from Starr County, Texas, identified the interaction of genes on chromosomes 2 ( CAPN10 (Calpain 10), then NIDDM1 ) and 15 (near CYP19 (Cytochrome P450, family 19, or Aromatase)) in contributiing to T2DM susceptibility . Association studies investigating interactions between variants of the Beta-3 adrenergic receptor ( ADRB3 ) and Uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1 ) genes observed in weak to no effects on weight gain and insulin resistance in Finnish and Danish populations, respectively.
20421984:93	A study of Type II iodothyronine deiodinase ( DIO2 ) and ADRB3 polymorphisms showed a synergistic effect on an increased BMI, suggesting an interaction between these two common gene variants while a study of intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) and ADRB3 showed no interaction on levels of fasting plasma glucose or measures of insulin resistance . In a study of Mexican-American families participating in the population-based San Antonio Family Heart Study the combined presence of common variants of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and ADRB3 are correlated with significantly higher BMI, insulin, and leptin levels than the presence of the PPARγ variants alone.
20421984:94	Yet another study examined two-locus interactions among 23 loci in T2DM candidate genes in the risk of T2DM, and found a significant interaction between variants in the Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP2) and PPARγ genes.
20421984:95	Identification of novel interactions and further confirmation of observed interactions may be critical in characterizing the genetic risk factors for T2DM and many other complex disease that remain among the unidentified components of the heritability of these diseases, and may have practical application in the identification of individuals who may belong to groups at high risk of disease who can benefit from preventive care.
20421984:96	In conclusion, FAM-MDR – unlike PGMDR – is able to handle complex and large pedigrees with additional unrelated individuals.
20421984:97	In fact, FAM-MDR analysis on split pedigree data should not be trusted because it might lead to overly optimistic results.
20421984:98	On the other hand, as pedigree size increases, the inherent conservative nature of FAM-MDR could become more pronounced.
20421984:99	Finally, PGMDR results – and in fact also GMDR results – are too liberal as no correction for multiple testing is carried out.
20661426:0	Introduction 
B cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is an adult leukemia characterized by the accumulation of B cells in the blood, bone marrow and secondary lymphoid tissues due to apparent survival advantages and/or apoptosis resistance of these cells in vivo . There is significant heterogeneity in the disease progression between CLL patients.
20661426:1	A more aggressive form of the disease, which results in lower patient survival time, correlates with markers including unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgHV) status and high expression of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (ZAP-70+).
20661426:2	Although the accumulation of a monoclonal population of CD5+/CD19+ B cells is characteristic of both prognostic groups, aggressive CLL appears to have some distinct characteristics and signaling properties compared to indolent CLL . 
Despite their enhanced survival in vivo when CLL cells from patients are cultured in vitro they rapidly undergo apoptosis under conditions that support the survival of normal B cells, underscoring the dependence of these cells on survival cues from the microenvironment . In the microenvironment, marrow stromal cells are believed to secrete factors that promote CLL cell survival in patients; correspondingly, when monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of CLL patients are cultured, they differentiate into “Nurse-like cells” (NLCs) that promote CLL survival in vitro .
20661426:3	One of the factors known to be secreted by these NLCs and to support CLL survival, is the chemokine, CXCL12 (SDF-1).
20661426:4	Additionally, CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, is overexpressed on CLL cells compared to normal B cells, and thus has the potential for enhanced responsiveness to CXCL12 signaling .
20661426:5	Although another chemokine receptor, CXCR7, can also bind CXCL12 and was previously shown to be expressed on B cells surface expression of CXCR7 was not observed on CLL B cells.
20661426:6	Therefore the CXCL12 signaling effects are likely mediated exclusively by CXCR4 in these cells.
20661426:7	While chemokines and their G-protein coupled receptors are best known for their role in directing the migration of immune cells, it is clear that these proteins are involved in many other biological functions.
20661426:8	The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is critical for developmental processes including lymphopoiesis, and central nervous system and cardiac development, and knockout of either the ligand or receptor in mice results in embryonic lethality . Due to the involvement of CXCL12/CXCR4 in migration, angiogenesis, and development, it is not surprising that this axis is often exploited by cancer cells for metastasis as well as survival and proliferation .
20661426:9	However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which these various functions are effectuated and how these signaling pathways target different downstream signaling molecules in cancer cells compared to non-malignant counterpart cells is largely unknown.
20661426:10	Similarly, while it is known that Akt and ERK1/2 are activated by CXCL12 in CLL, the downstream targets of these pathways and activation of other pathways have not been elucidated . 
Despite the upregulation of CXCR4 and strong Akt and ERK signaling demonstrated by CLL cells in response to CXCL12, the CLL cells actually migrate less efficiently to CXCL12 than B cells from healthy donors in a transwell migration assay.
20661426:11	Thus, in CLL cells, it appears that signaling downstream of CXCL12/CXCR4 may be redirected towards survival signaling in lieu of cell migration.
20661426:12	To better characterize the signaling responses to CXCL12 stimulation, primary CLL cells isolated from 5 patients were subjected to phosphoproteomic analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
20661426:13	Rather than attempting to characterize the complete phosphoproteome of CLL cells, this approach was designed to generate new hypotheses about the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling network in CLL survival, and to identify downstream proteins that might be good therapeutic targets.
20661426:14	While many phosphoproteins were identified in the CLL cells, comparison of spectral counts between CXCL12 stimulated and unstimulated cells allowed identification of proteins phosphorylated as a consequence of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.
20661426:15	With follow-up experiments, the tumor suppressor PDCD4 was validated as a downstream phosphorylation target of CXCL12 signaling in all CLL patient cells examined (n = 10) and HSP27 was similarly validated in a subset of CLL patients (∼25%).
20661426:16	Although these proteins have been previously linked to cancer cell survival, they have not been previously associated with CLL nor has PDCD4 been established as a downstream phosphorylation target of CXCL12 signaling.
20661426:17	Furthermore, a number of other proteins (many of which do not have commercially available phospho-specific antibodies available) have been proposed as potential downstream phosphorylation targets of CXCL12 stimulation based on spectral count analysis of the CLL phosphoproteomics data.

Discussion 
CLL is the most common leukemia in the Western world . The accumulation of CLL B cells is believed to result from low rates of precursor cell proliferation and via recruitment of accessory cells that create a supportive microenvironment by producing factors that foster CLL survival . The chemokine, CXCL12, is one of the cytokines produced by cells in the microenvironment that enhances CLL survival in vitro and likely in vivo .
20661426:19	Although chemokines are best known for their role as chemoattractants, we show here that CLL cells are much less capable of migrating to CXCL12 compared to CLL B cells, despite an upregulation of CXCR4 on the CLL cells . While the low levels of migration may still play a role in vivo it is evident that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is also networked into pathways involved in survival.
20661426:20	In contrast, CXCR7, the other receptor of CXCL12, is not expressed on the surface of CLL cells although it is expressed on normal B cells . Thus, while there is overlap in signaling pathways activated by CXCL12 in CLL cells and normal B cells, the differences in migration and CXCR7 expression, and the potential bias towards survival in CLL cells, suggest significant differences in the role that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis plays in the context of the normal and pathological cells.
20661426:21	Phosphoproteomics analysis of CXCL12-stimulated CLL cells was performed in an effort to determine potential downstream signaling targets that could contribute to the survival and malignancy of CLL cells.
20661426:22	As these are precious non-renewable primary patient cells, the intent of our phosphoproteomics approach was to generate hypotheses rather than an exhaustive analysis of the CLL phosphoproteome.
20661426:23	Therefore, while it would be ideal to use a number of phospho-enrichment strategies in addition to IMAC (e.g. TiO 2) and to employ additional liquid chromatography separation steps besides C18 (e.g. hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)) to expand the number of phosphoproteins identified, we focused our efforts on well established methods . Along these lines, the use of quantitative phosphoproteomics strategies is limited since these cells do not replicate and cannot be cultured long term.
20661426:24	Thus, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is not possible . Post-digest labeling with iTRAQ or ICAT isotopic labels is also difficult due to limited sample availability, limitations in instrumentation (one-third rule with the LTQ spectrometer restricting detection of the labels in the low molecular weight range) and the labile nature of phosphates and labels which causes reduced fragmentation and detection in MS/MS spectra . While understanding its limitations, spectral counting was employed as a semi-quantitative assessment of the CXCL12-stimulation responses and several candidates were followed up by western blot validation.
20661426:25	In addition to the above examples with PDCD4 and HSP27, which showed that the spectral counting provides a relatively good approximation of stimulation response, spectral counts reflecting fairly even levels of phosphorylated p21-activated kinase (PAK2), another target of the PI3K pathway, was also confirmed by western blot in all six patient cells probed for phospho-PAK2 (Ser141).
20661426:26	Through this phosphoproteomics approach, we were able to confidently identify close to 700 phosphoproteins in the CLL samples, including numerous proteins previously implicated in CLL disease.
20661426:27	Additionally, we identified many proteins that appear to exhibit changes in phosphorylation levels in response to CXCL12.
20661426:28	This data led to the identification and validation of several previously unknown phosphorylation targets of CXCL12 signaling.
20661426:29	Typical approaches (e.g. western blot) for investigating signaling in response to stimuli require a priori knowledge of specific targets and the availability of phospho-specific antibodies, which limits the ability to globally assess cellular signaling events.
20661426:30	Furthermore, validation studies of CLL cells are difficult since their viability in culture is limited.
20661426:31	They are also difficult to manipulate through transfection and transduction since they do not divide in culture or infect well (e.g. they require high MOI and/or pre-activation of cells with CD40L and IL-4 which could complicate interpretation of signaling analysis).
20661426:32	Therefore, this mass-spectrometry-based approach seemed the most effective method for gaining new insight into the function of CXCL12 on CLL cell survival and possibly disease aggressiveness.
20661426:33	Although not done in this study, comprehensive MS analysis of many patients may help to distinguish variations between patients, and with disease stratification and the identification of judicious therapeutic targets.
20661426:34	To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that PDCD4 is a phosphorylation target downstream of CXCL12 signaling in CLL or other cell types.
20661426:35	This finding is exciting due to the established role of PDCD4 as a tumor suppressor and as a substrate of Akt .
20661426:36	Although little is known regarding the function of two of the phosphorylation sites of PDCD4 (Ser94 and Ser76) identified from the LC-MS/MS analysis, phosphorylation at Ser457 near the C-terminus of the protein is a well-established site with known functional implications.
20661426:37	Phosphorylation at Ser457 by Akt has been shown to result in nuclear translocation of PDCD4 and a decrease in its ability to inhibit AP-1-mediated transcription and eIF4A-mediated translation ; although Ser67 phosphorylation was not directly identified in our LC-MS/MS analysis, it is likely that this sight is also phosphorylated in response to CXCL12 stimulation since PDCD4 degradation was observed following stimulation . In combination, these effects may reduce the growth regulating/tumor-suppressor capacity of PDCD4, thereby contributing to CLL cell survival and the malignancy phenotype.
20661426:38	Validation of PDCD4 phosphorylation also led to the identification of p70S6K phosphorylation and activation downstream of CXCL12 signaling in CLL cells.
20661426:39	Based on the phosphoproteomics analysis, HSP27 appeared to be another promising phosphorylation target of CXCL12-signaling.
20661426:40	HSP27 and several other HSPs have received attention in the context of cancer due to their cytoprotective/anti-apoptotic functions.
20661426:41	Specifically, HSP27 indirectly inhibits cytochrome c release and caspase activation and it sequesters cytosolic cytochrome c.
20661426:42	It also promotes degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB) and p27kip, and interacts with and supports the activity of Akt under stressful conditions, all leading to protection from apoptosis . We identified the presence of phosphorylated and total HSP27 protein and its upstream activator p38-MAPK in a subset (∼25%) of cell samples from different CLL patients.
20661426:43	Of note, the observed variability in signaling between different CLL patient cells highlights the underlying heterogeneity of the disease.
20661426:44	Furthermore, it serves as a reminder of how different parameters including patient differences (age and gender), variations in clinical course such as aggressiveness, stage and prognosis, and different treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, gene therapy, etc) may alter how the cells respond to different stimuli.
20661426:45	Such variability is not unprecedented as Messmer et al (submitted manuscript) have demonstrated differences in CXCL12-mediated MEK and ERK activation in different ZAP-70 subgroups of CLL, and Montresor et al demonstrated differences in CXCL12-mediated lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) activation in normal B cells compared to CLL B cells and amongst the cells of different CLL patients . Thus, it is reasonable to expect that different patients will exhibit different responses to stimuli, whether it is a survival stimulus from the microenvironment or a therapeutic agent used to treat the disease.
20661426:46	These results showing patient variability in HSP27 expression emphasize the strength of utilizing primary cells for understanding disease pathogenesis as opposed to cell lines, which are much more homogenous, but can be less insightful and sometimes misleading.
20661426:47	While there was considerable overlap in the phosphoproteins identified from LC-MS/MS analysis between different patients (CLL A – E), more comprehensive MS analysis of multiple patients may help to distinguish variations in signaling responses between patients.
20661426:48	Along these lines, since HSP27 is often induced following stressful cellular events such as treatment with chemotherapeutics, its induction in certain patients could reflect a response to treatment.
20661426:49	For example, lymphoma cells which did not express Hsp27 were sensitive to apoptosis while those expressing Hsp27 were resistant to apoptosis induced by Bortezomib (PS-341), a proteasome inhibitor . Silencing of Hsp27 in the resistant lymphoma cells then rendered them susceptible to Bortezomib-induced death, demonstrating its link in resistance to this chemotherapeutic treatment . Thus, a larger patient sample size may reveal if expression of HSP27 is induced by certain chemotherapeutics or in particular subsets of patients and whether there is any correlation to refractory disease, as resistance to chemotherapy is one of the major hurdles in treating CLL . 
Herein we present follow-up data to PDCD4 and HSP27, although there are numerous other candidate phosphoprotein targets of CXCL12 signaling in CLL cells that have been proposed.
20661426:50	A summary of our findings from phosphoproteomics analysis combined with some previously established pathways of CXCL12 signaling in CLL are summarized in a signaling diagram.
20661426:51	Overall, our data suggests that CXCL12 may preferentially activate survival signaling pathways rather than those involved in cell migration in CLL cells, although some of the pathway components (Gi, Erk, Akt) are common nodes.
20661426:52	We have demonstrated that the use of phosphoproteomics is a feasible and informative means of evaluating signaling responses to CXCL12 in CLL, which could be employed for investigating a variety of other stimuli in these or other primary cells.
20661426:53	Through phosphoproteomics detection and western blot validation, PDCD4 was found to be a common phosphorylation target of CXCL12-signaling in CLL while HSP27 was present in only a subset of CLL patients.
20661426:54	Although our focus was on CXCL12 as a survival factor, it is likely that other growth and survival stimuli may synergistically activate these pathways and downstream targets.
20661426:55	Therefore, PDCD4 and HSP27, which have previous implications in regulation of apoptosis and carcinogenesis, may represent potential therapeutic targets for treatment of CLL.
20661426:56	In fact, small molecule stabilizers of PDCD4, that enhance its function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting its degradation, are currently being developed due to its potential as a therapeutic target for numerous cancers.
15096278:0	Background 
Most studies of the symptomatology of dental treatment anxiety have focused on the contributions of pain or unpleasant experiences [ - ], traumatic experiences [ - ] and co-morbidity with other anxiety and mood complexes [ - ].
15096278:1	Although some have also reported feelings of lack of control, powerlessness and embarrassment in dental treatment situations as contributing factors [ - ], actual mechanisms and other details of these psychosocial factors have not been thoroughly described.
15096278:2	Earlier Scandinavian studies [ , ] indicated existence of a vicious circle of dental anxiety, in which embarrassment, shame or guilt have a central role in facilitating both anxiety and treatment avoidance, but they gave few details as to the exact role of embarrassment in this vicious circle (see Fig.
15096278:3	).
15096278:4	Since symptomatology and clinical significance are important in differential diagnosis of anxiety disorders, it seems that the influences of embarrassment, shame or guilt on dental anxiety have been relatively neglected in the literature.
15096278:5	Inspite of the fact that the dentist-patient clinical situation is a social situation and that several studies have also pointed to negative dentist behavior as highly anxiety provoking [ , , - ], descriptions of possibilities for the existence of social anxiety, defined as intense fear of negative evaluation  or humiliation  in social situations, have been few for patients suffering with dental anxiety [ , ].
15096278:6	Recent medical literature [ - ] has drawn attention to primary care occurrences of social anxiety disorder or phobia.
15096278:7	They suggest that perhaps practitioners and counselors are focused on other problems than social anxiety or judge that feelings of embarrassment, shame or guilt are only secondary to more concrete problems, such as specific phobias or presence of other co-morbid anxiety or mood disorders.
15096278:8	Thus, social anxiety and phobia are described as substantially under-diagnosed in both clinical and non-clinical samples [ - ].
15096278:9	Some  have questioned the adequacy of present methods in differentiating the existence of social anxiety disorder as principal diagnosis in both clinical and non-clinical populations.
15096278:10	This is currently accomplished using a standard interview schedule of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , the Standard Clinical Inventory of Disorders – Patient version (SCID-P).
15096278:11	Examples used in the SCID-P interview for social anxiety are fear of negative social evaluation with speaking eating or writing .
15096278:12	This would result in anxious dental patients rarely being diagnosed with social anxiety disorder or phobia, when fear of negative scrutiny in clinical social contexts might otherwise be a chief complaint and possible principal diagnosis.
15096278:13	There has been a call for more case study research on the topic of social anxiety criteria in medical and other social contexts in order to discover new situations in which this nominal data category may arise, also as principal diagnosis .
15096278:14	An International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety proposed guidelines for distinguishing social anxiety disorder from other anxiety disorders  as shown in Table . 
There can be confusion about the terms themselves, since in the course of daily conversation they are often used interchangeably.
15096278:15	The main differences are that embarrassment and shame are associated with personal response to public scrutiny about moral conventions or loss of self-esteem, while guilt (" bad " or " guilty conscience ") is thought of as self-scrutiny with breach of personal standards . When it is referred to as a specific emotion, embarrassment is described as more fleeting in duration and has less serious consequences  than shame.
15096278:16	However, embarrassment is also used as a more general term [ , ]: an emotional reaction (shame or guilt) to unintended and/or unwanted social predicaments or transgressions . In the present study, we use the term embarrassment as this general term, unless otherwise specified.
15096278:17	The aim of the present study was to describe details of social aspects of anxiety in dental situations, especially focusing on embarrassment phenomena and their contribution to manifestations of extreme or phobic dental anxiety.
15096278:18	Methods 
Subjects were 30 consecutive Danish adult patients from the Dental Phobia Research and Treatment Center (16 men, 14 women), aged 20–65 yr, who had avoided dental treatment for a mean of 12.7 years due to anxiety.
15096278:19	63% were self-referred as a result of mass media attention and/or friends or family urging, while 37% were professional referrals (physicians 20%; dentists 17%).
15096278:20	Previously published research inclusion criteria included: 1) extreme or phobic dental anxiety (Dental Anxiety Scale score = 15 (max.
15096278:21	20), 2) a need for dental treatment, and 3) ages ca. 18 to 65 yr.
15096278:22	Patients at the specialist center filled out psychometric questionnaires previously described in the literature  which included Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS), Dental Beliefs Survey (DBS)  covering aspects of patient perceptions about relations with dentists, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait subscale (STAI-T) covering general anxious anticipation, and a modified FSS-II Geer Fear Scale (GFS) covering existence and intensities of other fears.
15096278:23	Table has sample statistics and normative scores for DAS, GFS, STAI-T  and DBS . 
Subjects were asked the following questions in audio-taped initial fear assessment interviews: 1) "When was your last dental visit?
15096278:24	How did it go? 2) "What is the worst thing for you about dental visits?" 3) "Try to tell in your own words about your fear of dental treatment.
15096278:25	Where do you think it started?" 4) "Have there been any special experiences related to this?
15096278:26	" (If so: How old were you?) 5) "Do your friends or family know about your dental anxiety?
15096278:27	(If so: How do they react to it?) 6) "Do you feel that the condition of your teeth influences your relations to family and friends in any way?" 7) "Is there anything in your background that makes it so that you would be so afraid (besides any bad dental experiences)?" 8) "Are there other things that you are as afraid of?" (Specify: Doctors?
15096278:28	Hospitals?) 9) "How do you experience yourself under stressful conditions?" 
In an exit interview after treatment completion, patients were asked: 1) "What helped you most to get over your dental anxiety?", 2) "What helped you next most?" and 3) "Are there other things besides resolution of your dental anxiety that you have learned here?".
15096278:29	Such questions intended to provide a retrospective validation of initial chief complaint or indicate changes in diagnostic type as well as assess efficacy of treatment strategy for the type . 
In all interviews, unstructured follow-up questions were also employed to encourage descriptive detail e.g., "Could you tell me more about 'such and such'?" or confirmations of meanings e.g., "So you mean that you are embarrassed about your teeth?"
15096278:30	Although analysis of qualitative descriptions was the main research method, embarrassment intensity and degree of mouth-hiding behaviors were also scaled to check for associations with each other and with years of treatment avoidance for conceptual validation and explanatory purposes.
15096278:31	An embarrassment intensity rating scale was devised in which Ss were rated by the first and second authors from 0 = "no embarrassment" to 1 = "little", 2 = "some", 3 = "much" and 4 = "very much embarrassment or principal problem" based on clinical records and transcript material.
15096278:32	(Kappa statistic for the two raters concurred at 0.79, P < .001.)
15096278:33	Patient transcription reports about symptoms of not being able to smile or laugh fully and mouth-hiding during social interactions were coded: 0 = "none", 1 = "unspecified inhibitions or hiding – low degree", 2 = "hiding with lip or tongue only" and 3 = "combined hiding with lip or tongue and hiding with hand or head behaviors".
15096278:34	All subjects participated after written and verbal informed consent, in accordance with local ethics committee standards and the Helsinki declaration.
15096278:35	Results 
Discussion 
The number of Ss in the present study was designed to be the minimum, manageable number necessary to capture a comprehensive range of embarrassment phenomena and characteristics.
15096278:36	Although some caution must be advised in the interpretation of results, sampling is similar to previously described larger samples at the same clinic.
15096278:37	The self-referral nature of the dental anxiety specialist clinic probably excluded patients with symptoms of mood disorders, depression, or agoraphobia in this clinical sample.
15096278:38	Clearly, some odontophobic patients have a perception of the dental environment as threatening beyond just the threat of physically painful treatment.
15096278:39	Present results showed that chief complaints of social powerlessness in dental situations either resulted from conditioned distrust of dentist behaviors or embarrassment with decreases in self-esteem often leading to fear of negative social scrutiny.
15096278:40	These latter complaints often appear to fulfill DSM psychiatric criteria for social anxiety disorder for this circumscribed area.
15096278:41	This fear of negative social evaluation and associated poor self-esteem is comparable in many ways to other circumscribed specific social anxiety disorders, such as fear of scrutiny while speaking, eating, or writing and perhaps is just as socially and personally debilitating.
15096278:42	Indeed perhaps what is being described here is the process of suffering . Researchers of suffering process Kahn & Steeves  have described it as, "Changes in personal identity may result from loss of function or changes in body image that are perceived as threats to self.".
15096278:43	Feelings related to neglect of dental health care and poor appearance of the teeth were often associated with identity problems for many of the present cases.
15096278:44	Perhaps to the routined private practitioner of dentistry, the oral cavity is a technical work place divided up into quadrants, where each tooth has its number and anatomical coordinates.
15096278:45	But even a casual comment with a raised eyebrow as to "how long it has been since the last appointment" becomes a feared catastrophe for many phobic patients.
15096278:46	Some might even quit a dental practice inspite of critical need for treatment of painful oral symptoms.
15096278:47	Berggren  first described the "vicious circle of dental anxiety" among a population of Swedish odontophobic patients in whom feelings of guilt, shame and inferiority catalyzed maintenance of fear and further avoidance (Fig. ).
15096278:48	Present results confirm this vicious circle and describe the embarrassment factor as an amplifier for anxiety, increasing the intensity of the phobic reaction, especially with more and more years of treatment avoidance.
15096278:49	Although they did not refer directly to embarrassment or shame, Gale  and Stouthard and Hoogstraten  reported that negative dentist behaviors such as "Dentist laughs as he looks in your mouth." or "Dentist tells you that you have bad teeth.", in the social context of dental treatment are among the most intense anxiety stimuli.
15096278:50	Their findings indicated that there may be a dimension of humiliation in the anxiety.
15096278:51	In college students with high dental anxiety Bernstein et al  found that half cited negative dentist behaviors as the origin; 81 percent did not mention pain.
15096278:52	In results from Danish  and Swedish  dental anxiety studies of clinical samples similar to the present sample, there were similar findings of complicated psychiatric symptomatology specific to the dentist-patient situation.
15096278:53	In a 1977 Swedish qualitative study, Bjercke et al  assessed 22 patients referred for specialist treatment of dental phobia.
15096278:54	After extensive interviewing, they were classified according to "standard psychiatric nomenclature".
15096278:55	Over half of the patients had a record of previous psychiatric problems or a discordant childhood.
15096278:56	Twelve of the patients described feelings of inferiority based on their dental anxiety and avoided other people.
15096278:57	They concluded that dental phobia was usually a more complex psychiatric syndrome that was puzzling, since it was more intensely experienced by patients than one would expect of other phobias.
15096278:58	It also demonstrated the necessity to gain complete diagnostic information before planning interventions.
15096278:59	Regarding intensity with which patients can experience dental anxiety, much as Sheehan and Sheehan  described that outcomes of treatment can reveal accuracy of diagnoses in retrospect, results over 17-years at the Dental Phobia Research and Treatment Center has shown that in many cases improved efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy often was linked to a two phase course of treatment.
15096278:60	Dependent on the intensity of embarrassment, shame or guilt presented by the client, the first phase was cognitive restructuring of social interactions with clients, where embarrassment, shame or guilt has been the primary focus.
15096278:61	Desensitizations were first confined to the therapist-dentist as "object" (interpersonal distances and stepwise mouth exam sequence), if necessary.
15096278:62	This "turned down the amplifier" so to speak, making it easier for the client to focus on the second, more instrumental phase of desensitization to dental instruments and procedures, often with surprising ease.
15096278:63	This illustrates how awareness of embarrassment complexes is important to therapy for dental anxiety and as well as a need for further research.
15096278:64	Feelings of social powerlessness and embarrassment in dental situations were also the most important factors associated with phobic avoidance in nearly half of 80 patients in earlier Danish studies by Moore et al.
15096278:65	Although results indicated that the most frequent category was social phobia when comparing another diagnostic system with DSM terminology, the assessment was overestimated according to current social anxiety disorder criteria . Many of these subjects probably exhibited learned distrust of dentist behaviors, which was confused with symptoms of social phobia.
15096278:66	Liddell and Gosse  referred to the Danish studies described above and noted the distinction between conditioned social distrust at the dentist versus fears of negative dentist evaluation in a sample of graduate students with dental anxiety.
15096278:67	Present results also confirm a clinical distinction between distrust of dentists versus embarrassment, shame or guilt as chief complaint and primary problem.
15096278:68	This embarrassment was associated with 1) the act of self-neglect, 2) actual, visible tooth damage from neglect or 3) exaggerated perceptions of tooth damage associated with guilty conscience.
15096278:69	In phobic distrust of dentist behaviors, embarrassment also presented as a secondary reaction.
15096278:70	Conditioned anxious distrust of dentists by DSM criteria would be a specific phobia, which is persistent fear in which an object or situation is avoided or endured with intense anxiety and significantly interferes with normal routines or relationships.
15096278:71	Choice of therapeutic strategy for specific phobias requires primarily desensitization for fear reduction, while social anxiety related dental anxiety would primarily require cognitive reframing of social interaction contexts combined with interpersonal desensitization .
15096278:72	Thus, it is important that clinicians become attentive to the degree of embarrassment related to dental anxiety, where different intensity levels require different choices or sequences of therapeutic strategy.
15096278:73	There may be differences between Danish patients and other ethno-cultural groups of patients experiencing dental anxiety.
15096278:74	Moore et al have indicated that distribution of type of dental anxiety and perceptions of painful procedures varies among different ethno-cultural groups.
15096278:75	For example, the "Law of Jante" is perhaps a special phenomenon unique to Scandinavian populations that could facilitate embarrassment and fear of negative social evaluation  in general.
15096278:76	Thus, hypothetically there could be a higher incidence of embarrassment and/or social anxiety disorder in Denmark or other Scandinavian countries than in other countries . Given that DSM-IV psychiatric criteria have been coordinated with European standard criteria (ICD-10) , one would not expect international variation in diagnostic categories, but rather differences in their percentages of distribution from country to country.
15096278:77	Since they have broad implications for therapeutic outcome and relapse, there is a need to operationalize the meanings of specific "social situations" for diagnostic accuracy, since no standardized instrument can be used in all contexts for comparisons [ , ].
15096278:78	In dental clinical contexts, a start would be to ask clients, 1) "Are you uncomfortable or embarrassed about your mouth?" and 2) "Do you find it hard to interact with people in general (or 3) dentists or staff) due to your dental situation?".
15096278:79	These are similar to recommendations made by the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety on future studies of social anxiety disorder . A recently described scale measuring psychosocial effects of dental anxiety also appears to hold promise . 
Conclusions 
The complexities of phobic dental anxiety that baffled Swedish researchers in the late 1970s are perhaps only now beginning to be understood.
15096278:80	Embarrassment is a complex dental anxiety manifestation showing clinical differences by complaint characteristics and perceived intensity.
15096278:81	Some of present cases exhibited manifestations similar to psychiatric criteria for social anxiety disorder, while most manifested embarrassment as a side effect.
15096278:82	Sensitivity and understanding about the psychosocial nature of the dental health care environment should be an aim in the education of dentists in the 21 st century, in order to prevent and treat suffering from extreme or phobic dental anxiety and related dysfunctional phenomena.

20007605:0	INTRODUCTION 
Chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes requires the coordinated action of a large number of replication factors.
20007605:1	Unlike leading strand DNA synthesis, lagging strand DNA synthesis proceeds discontinuously via the generation of Okazaki fragments.
20007605:2	DNA polymerase (pol) α-primase first synthesizes ∼10 nucleotides (nt) of RNA, followed by the addition of short DNA stretches, which are designated ‘RNA–DNA primers’.
20007605:3	These are different from the RNA-only primers observed in prokaryotes.
20007605:4	The second DNA polymerase, pol δ, extends the RNA–DNA primers to form new Okazaki fragments with the aid of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C (RFC).
20007605:5	Pol δ not only extends the newly synthesized Okazaki fragments but it also creates flap structures by displacing the 5′-end region of downstream Okazaki fragments.
20007605:6	Flaps can be processed by nucleases to form ligatable nicks, which are sealed by DNA ligase I to produce continuous double-stranded (ds) DNA.
20007605:7	Short flap regions can be removed by the activity of flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1), which is a structure-specific endonuclease.
20007605:8	However, when the flap region is relatively long (>20 nt), flap cleavage requires Dna2, an endonuclease/helicase.
20007605:9	Replication protein A (RPA) can bind efficiently to DNA flaps longer than 27 nt in length, which inhibits Fen1 activity.
20007605:10	In contrast to Fen1, RPA-bound flaps are efficiently cleaved by Dna2 because its endonuclease activity is markedly stimulated.
20007605:11	Thus, RPA can act as a nuclease switch for the sequential processing of long flaps that are processed first by Dna2, and then by Fen1 to form a nick.
20007605:12	Although the majority of Okazaki fragments appear to be removed in vitro via generation of short flaps in a Fen1-dependent manner, a substantial fraction of flaps generated in vitro are long, and their processing requires both Fen1 and Dna2.
20007605:13	Therefore, both pathways are essential for processing of all flaps.
20007605:14	In vivo however, the level of long and/or short flaps formed is not known.
20007605:15	The production of long flaps can be influenced by the failure of cleavage at the early stages in strand displacement reaction due to inadequate Fen1 activity, enhanced strand displacement by pol δ or the failure of 3′→5′ proofreading function of pol δ.
20007605:16	Alternatively, there may be sequences that can be more readily displaced by pol δ.
20007605:17	All of these factors can lead to elevate the levels of long flaps.
20007605:18	In order to gain more insights into the processing of long flaps by Dna2, we searched for genetic suppressors that could rescue a particular defect caused by a mutation in DNA2 . This approach identified the non-essential VTS1 gene of S. cerevisiae as a suppressor of the dna2-K1080E mutant (glutamate substitution for lysine at position 1080, the ATP-binding motif), which lacks ATPase/helicase activities.
20007605:19	VTS1 was originally identified in S. cerevisiae as a multi-copy (and low-copy) suppressor of vti1–2 mutant cells that displayed defects in growth and vacuole transport.
20007605:20	However, it is not clear whether Vts1 is directly involved in vesicle trafficking.
20007605:21	One notable structural motif present in Vts1 is the sterile-α motif (SAM) domain.
20007605:22	This domain is highly abundant in eukaryotes and known to mediate protein–protein interactions for transcription regulation, signal-transduction cascades and nucleic acid binding.
20007605:23	A subclass of SAM domain can bind RNA.
20007605:24	For example, both Vts1 of S. cerevisiae and Smaug of Drosophila melanogaster recognize and bind RNAs possessing a specific structure (named SRE, SMAUG recognition element).
20007605:25	This structural element consists of a RNA stem and a pentanucleotide loop (pentaloop; CNGGN, N for any nucleotide) ( , ).
20007605:26	Disruption of the stem or a single base change in any of the three conserved nucleotides in the pentaloop significantly reduced the RNA-binding activity of Smaug or Vts1.
20007605:27	Conversely, a single amino acid substitution in the SAM domain of Smaug or Vts1 abolished its ability to bind the RNA-stem-loop structure.
20007605:28	Consistent with the role of Smaug in Drosophila S. cerevisiae Vts1 regulated the stability of artificial mRNAs containing an SRE at their 3′-untranslated region.
20007605:29	However, target mRNAs that are regulated by Vts1 have not been identified yet.
20007605:30	The SAM domain has also been implicated in DNA binding.
20007605:31	For example, the RuvA subunit, a component of the prokaryotic RuvABC complex that processes recombination intermediates, contains this domain that is required for binding Holliday junction structures.
20007605:32	Since VTS1 was isolated as a suppressor of defects in Okazaki fragment processing, we investigated its biochemical interactions with Dna2 and Fen1.
20007605:33	In this study, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence that Vts1 is involved in Okazaki fragment processing by modulating the endonuclease activity of Dna2.
20007605:34	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
Though dna2 helicase-deficient mutant yeast cells fail to grow in media containing glucose, they grow slowly in the presence of poor carbon sources such as lactate and glycerol.
20007605:35	These cells are viable in the presence of low levels of hydroxyurea that do not affect the growth of wild-type cells (data not shown).
20007605:36	These findings suggest that the helicase activity of Dna2 is not essential and is dispensable under certain growth conditions unlike its endonuclease activity.
20007605:37	Thus, it is likely that the in vivo function of the Dna2 helicase activity can be replaced by other helicases or enzymes.
20007605:38	These considerations prompted us to screen for the genes that suppress the growth defects of the dna2-K1080E helicase-deficient mutant to find a new helicase involved in Okazaki fragment processing in eukaryotes.
20007605:39	During the course of this work, we identified Vts1 as a genetic suppressor of helicase-negative dna2-K1080E.
20007605:40	Contrary to our expectation, we found that Vts1 is devoid of helicase activity and has no effect on the Dna2 helicase activity (data not shown).
20007605:41	Although Vts1 was originally reported to play a role in cytoplasmic events such as posttranscriptional regulation, our findings suggested that Vts1 affects nuclear events as well, particularly in Okazaki fragment processing in yeast.
20007605:42	This conclusion is supported by a substantial number of results presented here.
20007605:43	These include the following: (i) The double mutants such as vts1Δ dna2Δ405N and vts1Δ dna2-7 grew more slowly than single mutants alone.
20007605:44	(ii) The stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 required specific protein–protein interactions between the two proteins.
20007605:45	Not only the physical interaction between Vts1 and Dna2 but also the stimulation of the Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 required the N-terminal 405-amino-acid domain of Dna2.
20007605:46	(iii) Vts1 was shown to be a flap-structure-specific DNA-binding protein.
20007605:47	(iv) Vts1 stimulated yeast Fen1, another endonuclease essential for processing of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes.
20007605:48	(v) Finally, we showed that Vts1 was present in yeast nuclei, consistent with its function in Okazaki fragment processing.
20007605:49	Our biochemical and genetic data indicate that the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 is a major factor contributing to its suppression of the dna2-K1080E mutation.
20007605:50	This is supported by our findings that the suppression of dna2-K1080E was observed when the mutant dna2-K1080E allele was provided in a multi-copy plasmid.
20007605:51	In addition, the extent of suppression depended on the levels of Dna2-K1080E expression; suppression was more pronounced when Dna2-K1080E expression was driven by the strong ADH1 promoter ( C).
20007605:52	Thus, elevated levels of Dna2 endonuclease activity are required to overcome the helicase deficiency caused by this mutation.
20007605:53	Since the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 requires its DNA-binding activity, it is possible that the binding of Vts1 to DNA substrates could alter the DNA structure and render it more susceptible to Dna2 cleavage.
20007605:54	However, this notion is unlikely because the stimulation was allele-specific.
20007605:55	Vts1 stimulated wild-type Dna2, but not Dna2Δ405N.
20007605:56	In addition, Vts1 interacted with wild-type Dna2, but not Dna2Δ405N in ELISA assays.
20007605:57	These results indicate that the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease by Vts1 requires its DNA-binding activity and its ability to interact with Dna2.
20007605:58	For these reasons, we conclude that the specific and stable binding of Vts1 to flap DNA substrates contributes to efficient Okazaki fragment processing by targeting Dna2 efficiently to flap DNA.
20007605:59	Although Vts1 significantly stimulated yeast Fen1, it was unable to reverse the RPA inhibition of the endonuclease activity of Fen1 (data not shown).
20007605:60	This finding suggests that Vts1 cannot displace RPA from RPA-coated flaps.
20007605:61	Thus, it is possible that Vts1 binds to the flap structure less strongly, individually or cooperatively, than RPA.
20007605:62	In the presence of both RPA and Vts1, Vts1 stimulated the degradation of flaps shorter than 20 nt, at which RPA binds poorly (data not shown).
20007605:63	Though Vts1 robustly stimulated Fen1 activity in vitro it is unlikely that this effect contributes to the suppression of the dna2-K1080E mutation since Vts1 in a multi-copy plasmid failed to suppress dna2Δ405N.
20007605:64	If suppression of the dna2-K1080E mutation occurred solely by the stimulation of Fen1, we would expect that overexpression of Vts1 could suppress both dna2-K1080E and dna2Δ405N because overexpression of Fen1 suppressed both dna2-K1080E (data not shown) and dna2Δ405N.
20007605:65	Therefore, it appears that the stimulation of Fen1 by Vts1 in vivo may not be sufficient to suppress dna2Δ405N .
20007605:66	However, it is possible that the stimulation of Fen1 by Vts1 could provide an explanation for more severe growth defects observed with the double mutants, vts1Δ dna2Δ405N and vts1Δ dna2-7.
20007605:67	The following scenario would be possible; in vts1Δ cells, the deletion of VTS1 may reduce the function of Fen1 compared to that found in wild-type cells.
20007605:68	Despite the normal protein levels of Fen1, the absence of Vts1 (and lack of Fen1 stimulation) could lead to a decrease of Fen1 activity in vivo .
20007605:69	This scenario could account for the more severe growth defects observed with vts1Δ dna2Δ405N or vts1Δ dna2-7 compared to the single mutation.
20007605:70	It is noteworthy that Vts1 can bind to duplex ends efficiently.
20007605:71	This property was especially evident in the presence of high levels of Vts1 and with substrates containing a 1-nt overhang at its 3′-end (data not shown).
20007605:72	If this were the case, the DNase I protection observed near the duplex ends would not be physiologically relevant during Okazaki fragment processing since duplex ends are not available for the binding.
20007605:73	However, it is possible that the duplex end binding activity of Vts1 could function in other DNA transactions.
20007605:74	In summary, we suggest that Vts1 is involved in the processing of Okazaki fragments, and possibly other DNA events such as repair and recombination.
20007605:75	During repair and recombination, flap-like structures can be formed and they can be efficiently removed by Fen1 and Dna2 in the presence of Vts1.

18796167:0	Background 
Protein kinases of the IκB kinase (IKK) family are known for their roles in innate immune response signaling pathways in both mammals and Drosophila [ - ].
18796167:1	All mammalian IKKs studied so far have roles in immune responses, but operate on different targets.
18796167:2	IKKs are multi-subunit complexes consisting of two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a structural component (IKKγ/NEMO).
18796167:3	IKKα and IKKβ were identified in a protein complex that phosphorylates IκB and targets it for degradation, thereby allowing the nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB transcription factors [ - ].
18796167:4	The isoforms IKKε and TANK binding kinase 1 are required to for phosphrylation and activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 in response to viral infection [ - ].
18796167:5	Two members of the IKK family are known in Drosophila namely DmIKKβ and Ik2 . DmIKKβ performs similarly to the mammalian IKKα and participates in antibacterial innate immune response . In contrast, ik2 (also known as DmIKKε ) was shown to control actin and microtubule (MT) organization in an NF-κB-independent pathway [ , ].
18796167:6	Recently it was reported that Ik2 binds to Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1) and accelerates its degradation in a kinase-dependent manner . One of the nonapoptotic processes that Ik2 regulates through the DIAP1/caspase pathway is assembly of the actin cytoskeleton . In ik2 loss-of-function mutants, tracheal terminal cells, bristles, and the antenna arista laterals, all of which require accurate F-actin assembly for their polarized elongation, exhibited aberrantly branched morphology.
18796167:7	These phenotypes were sensitive to a change in the dosage of DIAP1 and the caspase DRONC without apparent change in cell viability . In addition, over-expression of Ik2 destabilized F-actin based structures.
18796167:8	These results suggest that Ik2 may act as a negative regulator of F-actin assembly, maintaining the fidelity of polarized elongation during cell morphogenesis by modulating the level of DIAP1.
18796167:9	A different aspect of the ik2 role in cytoskeleton related processes is revealed through oogenesis studies.
18796167:10	During oogenesis, ik2 is required in an NF-κB-independent process for localization of oskar and gurken mRNAs . As a result, females that lack ik2 in the germline produce embryos that are bicaudal, ranging from headless embryos to embryos with a duplicated abdomen in place of the head and thorax.
18796167:11	They also exhibit a ventralized phenotype.
18796167:12	Abnormal mRNA localization in ik2 mutant oocytes could be attributed to defects in the organization of MT minus-ends.
18796167:13	In addition, ik2 mutant oocytes and mutant escaper adults have abnormalities in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton .
18796167:14	However, the regulatory target for ik2 in controlling the oocyte cytoskeleton is still unknown.
18796167:15	In a global two-hybrid screen, Ik2 was found to interact with Spindle-F (Spn-F) (CG12114) . Our previous work has shown that this newly discovered protein, Spn-F is part of a yet uncharacterized pathway leading to the organization of a distinct subset of MTs in the Drosophila oocyte . spn-F was first identified as a maternal effect mutation that affects the dorsal-ventral polarity of the eggshell . The asymmetric distribution of maternal determinants ( gurken bicoid and oskar mRNAs) in the oocyte was analyzed, and it was found that spn-F like ik2 is required for proper localization of gurken during oogenesis.
18796167:16	In addition to the maternal effect, spn-F like ik2 also affects the bristle morphology of the adult fly.
18796167:17	Moreover, in spn-F mutants, α-tubulin is abnormally associated with the oocyte nuclear periphery, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Tau fusion protein accumulates abnormally around the oocyte nucleus.
18796167:18	spn-F was cloned and found to encode a novel coiled-coil protein, which co-localizes specifically to oocyte cortex regions, where the minus ends of MTs reside, and also occurs in a punctate granular pattern in the nurse cells . Thus, earlier work show that spn-F affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of a subset of MTs during Drosophila oogenesis.
18796167:19	Since ik2 mutants share many phenotypes with spn-F including a very similar bristle phenotype, ventralized eggshells, and specific effects on MT organization in oogenesis , we decided to study the nature of the interaction between these two proteins.
18796167:20	We show that Ik2 directly interacts with Spn-F and that the C-terminus of Spn-F is crucial for this interaction.
18796167:21	We also demonstrate that Ik2 is capable of phosphorylating Spn-F, but that such phosphorylation is not essential for their interaction and also does not lead to Spn-F degradation.
18796167:22	We find that Ik2 and Spn-F co-localize to the anterior ring of the oocyte and in a punctate structure in the nurse cells.
18796167:23	Furthermore, we show that Spn-F and Ik2 are mutually required for this localization.
18796167:24	We therefore conclude that Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex that regulates cytoskeleton organization during Drosophila oogenesis.
18796167:25	Our finding that phosphorylation of Spn-F by Ik2 has no effect on Spn-F protein degradation, contrary to the degradation seen in the case of DIAP1, demonstrates a new mode of action for Ik2 in the germline.
18796167:26	Results 
Discussion 
Recent studies implicate the Drosophila IKKε homologue ik2 in seemingly unrelated NF-κB functions.
18796167:27	It was shown that ik2 modulates caspases for a nonapoptotic function and controls both actin and MT cytoskeletons [ , ], and also that it regulates the actin cytoskeleton through phosphorylation and degradation of DIAP1 .
18796167:28	Moreover, it was reported that, in ik2 mutant oocytes, abnormal mRNA localization can be attributed to defects in organization of MT minus-ends, giving rise to ventralized and bicaudal phenotypes of mutant embryos . Whereas the control of actin polymerization appears to be mediated by a nonapoptotic function of DIAP1, the regulatory target of Ik2 in controlling cytoskeleton organization in the oocyte is still unknown.
18796167:29	In this study we examined whether spn-F which showed precisely the same ovarian and bristle phenotypes as ik2 mutants, might be an Ik2 target.
18796167:30	In previous work we reported that spn-F encodes a novel protein that affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of MTs during Drosophila oogenesis . In this work we show that Ik2 physically interacts with Spn-F and forms a relatively stable complex.
18796167:31	In addition, we show that Ik2 phosphorylates Spn-F but that the interaction between these two proteins is independent of phosphorylation.
18796167:32	Thus, our results suggest that Spn-F is a putative regulatory substrate of Ik2.
18796167:33	Moreover, our results indicate that the nature of the interaction between Spn-F and Ik2 is different from that attributed to Ik2 and DIAP1.
18796167:34	We showed that Spn-F phosphorylation by Ik2 had no effect on its stability in S2 cells.
18796167:35	Supporting this conclusion is the finding that over-expression of Ik2 in the ovaries had no effect on Spn-F stability or development [10; present study], indicating that over-expression of ik2 does not lead to Spn-F degradation.
18796167:36	Furthermore, the ovarian phenotype of spn-F mutant is similar to the ovarian phenotype of ik2 . Thus, whereas Ik2 regulates organization of the actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation and degradation of DIAP1, in the oocyte, rather than affecting Spn-F degradation, Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex that regulates the oocyte cytoskeleton.
18796167:37	How does the IK2/Spn-F complex function in the germline?
18796167:38	In this study, we showed that Ik2 and Spn-F are co-localized both to the anterior ring during mid-oogenesis and to punctate structures in the nurse cells.
18796167:39	Additionally, Ik2 and Spn-F are mutually required for correct localization in the germline.
18796167:40	In ik2 germline clones, Spn-F protein localization along the anterior cortex is significantly reduced relative to the wild-type egg chamber and Spn-F aggregates in the oocyte; also, there is a higher accumulation of the punctate structures containing Spn-F protein in the nurse cells as compared with the wild type.
18796167:41	Furthermore, we found that Ik2 localization to the anterior end of the oocyte and to the punctate structure in the nurse cells depends on spn-F . Thus, we suggest that the correct localization of Spn-F and Ik2 complex to special compartment within the oocyte is an essential requirement for organization of oocyte cytoskeleton.
18796167:42	The defects observed in ik2 and spn-F mutants oocyte are most likely due to misslocalization of the Ik2/Spn-F complex.
18796167:43	Immunostaining has shown that Spn-F protein localizes to the minus end of the MT network in the oocyte and also to granules in the nurse cells.
18796167:44	In our previous work we found that depolymerization of MT and mutations in Dynein heavy chain cause a significant loss of Spn-F localization at the oocyte anterior cortex . In addition, these treatments results in substantial increase in both the number and the size of Spn-F granules in the nurse cells.
18796167:45	These observations suggest that Spn-F is transported from the nurse cells to the oocyte and that this transport could be mediated by Dynein.
18796167:46	In the present study we found that when Ik2 was expressed alone in S2R+ cells, it was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm whereas Spn-F localized to cytoplasmic punctate structures.
18796167:47	When both proteins were co-expressed in S2R+, Ik2 was co-localized to the cytoplasmic punctate structures along with Spn-F.
18796167:48	Moreover, we found a higher accumulation of punctate structures containing Spn-F protein in the nurse cells in ik2 mutants as compared with the wild type, similarly to our observation in Dynein heavy chain mutant.
18796167:49	Taking all of our results into account, we would like to propose that Spn-F is required for localization of Ik2 to cytoplasmic transport vesicles while Ik2 is required for correct transport of the complex from nurse cells to oocyte.
18796167:50	Once the complexes are in the oocyte, they may accumulate at certain cortical sites where they promote the interaction of MTs and the actin cytoskeleton.
18796167:51	Conclusion 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex which regulates cytoskeleton organization during Drosophila oogenesis and in which Spn-F is the direct regulatory target for Ik2.
18796167:52	Unlike other IKK proteins, Ik2 phosphorylates Spn-F without promoting its degradation.

Results 
The distributions of selected demographic and health characteristics for the case and control women with PCB laboratory measurements are provided in . Cases and controls were similar with regard to race, education, and BMI.
20423815:1	A higher percentage of cases than controls were current alcohol users (chi-square p -value = 0.02).
20423815:2	The distribution of demographic and health characteristics were similar for study subjects who did and did not provide blood samples (results not shown).
20423815:3	The population median wet-weight serum PCB concentration and the minimum and maximum detected concentrations of each PCB congener are shown in Supplemental Material, Table 1 (doi:10.1289/ehp.0901444).
20423815:4	For those congeners with > 25% of samples below the limit of detection (PCB congeners 87, 101, 128, 149, 151, 157, 167, 172, 177, 178, 183, and 189), the percentage of quantified samples did not differ by disease status, nor were the quantified PCB congeners associated with endometriosis in analyses of categorized PCB concentration with observations below the detection limit included in the reference category (results not shown).
20423815:5	Higher quartiles of ∑PCB concentrations and estrogenic PCB concentrations were not associated with endometriosis risk.
20423815:6	In congener-specific analyses, modestly elevated—albeit not statistically significant—ORs were observed for PCBs 44, 49, 118, and 138 in some quartiles (maximum OR = 1.5).
20423815:7	We observed inverse associations of PCB 170, PCB 196, and PCB 201 concentrations with endometriosis risk in some quartiles; however, there were no overall consistent patterns of endometriosis risk with these congeners.
20423815:8	Using the natural log-transformed continuous PCB measures, we found no statistically significant log-linear associations with endometriosis risk for any of the congeners assessed.
20423815:9	Stratifying on parity, neither ∑PCB nor estrogenic PCB concentrations were associated with endometriosis risk, similar to our analysis of all women combined.
20423815:10	Similarly, individual PCB congeners were not associated with endometriosis risk when stratified by parity (results not shown).
20423815:11	Our results were not substantially different when restricted to ovarian endometriosis cases only, nonovarian pelvic endometriosis cases only, or non–infertility-related case status (results not shown).
20423815:12	In post hoc analyses excluding DDE as a potential confounding factor (because of potential collinearity with PCB), there was little difference in the overall interpretation of the results (results not shown).
20423815:13	Compared with the results in and the ORs were not increased in analyses restricted to asymptomatic controls, suggesting that the presence of undiagnosed symptomatic cases in our control group was unlikely to have affected our study (results not shown).
20423815:14	Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based case–control study of the association between non–dioxin-like PCB concentrations and endometriosis.
20423815:15	After controlling for age, reference year, income, alcohol consumption, serum lipids, and serum DDE, we observed statistically significant inverse associations for PCBs 170, 196, and 201 with endometriosis risk.
20423815:16	Given the large number of statistical tests conducted, we would have expected at least three statistically significant associations; thus, these quartile associations are likely due to chance.
20423815:17	Further, these associations have not been reported elsewhere, and they did not exhibit exposure–response relationships that would strengthen evidence for causation.
20423815:18	The ORs calculated using quartiles of ∑PCB and estrogenic PCB serum concentrations provided evidence against an association between non–dioxin-like PCBs and endometriosis, and the lack of association was consistent in both parous and nulliparous subgroups.
20423815:19	Additionally, there were no consistent log- linear trends in the association between ∑PCB-, estrogenic PCB–, or congener-specific PCB levels and endometriosis risk.
20423815:20	Several studies have evaluated non–dioxin-like PCBs and endometriosis risk, with inconsistent results ( ; ; ; ; ; ).
20423815:21	There was a suggestion of increased endometriosis risk with PCBs 138, 153, and 180 in a German study and in two studies conducted in Rome, Italy, with overlapping study populations, findings that were not replicated in our study or in other studies ( ; ; ; ).
20423815:22	In the study conducted in Germany, reported significantly higher mean serum concentrations of PCBs 138, 153, and 180 among women with endometriosis ( n = 28) compared with women without endometriosis ( n = 441).
20423815:23	The authors evaluated PCB and endometriosis risk in a population of women attending a medical center at the University of Heidelberg for “hormone disturbances” and compared mean PCB concentrations in women with endometriosis and women without endometriosis.
20423815:24	It is unclear whether the presence of endometriosis was laparoscopically or histologically confirmed, and it does not appear that the authors adjusted for serum lipids when making comparisons.
20423815:25	In the most recent and largest of the two Italian studies, reported significantly elevated concentrations of PCBs 118, 138, 153, 170, and 180 in cases ( n = 80) with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis compared with the controls ( n = 78), nulliparous women with benign gynecologic conditions and no evidence of endometriosis.
20423815:26	In contrast to that study, our study was not restricted to nulliparous women; however, we did evaluate our PCB–endometriosis associations stratified by parity, and our conclusions were not substantially different among nulliparous women.
20423815:27	Our results may have differed because our control group was not restricted to women undergoing laparoscopy; rather, it was a random sample of reproductive-age women from the GH population.
20423815:28	Furthermore, we included serum lipids as a covariate in our model rather than using lipid-standardized PCB concentrations, because the latter may be prone to bias, depending on the hypothesized underlying PCB–lipid disease association.
20423815:29	Finally, differences between our results and the study by may be due to geographic variability in PCB concentrations.
20423815:30	The lipid-adjusted geometric mean PCB congener concentrations PCBs 138, 153, and 180 were almost twice as high in the control population from Rome than in our Washington State control population (e.g., the geometric mean concentration for PCB 153 was 61.8 ng/g lipid in the Porpora study, compared with 32.4 ng/g lipid among those detected in the present study), and it is possible that PCBs contribute to endometriosis risk only at higher concentrations than those observed in our study.
20423815:31	The remaining studies that evaluated non–dioxin-like PCBs and endometriosis risk have reported a lack of association between ∑PCB concentrations and endometriosis risk; although they have included PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180, most have not reported congener- specific results, further limiting comparison among studies ( ; ; ; ).
20423815:32	One pilot study conducted at an infertility clinic in Belgium found no association of lipid-adjusted concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, 153, or 180 and endometriosis risk, in contrast to the German and Italian studies.
20423815:33	The lipid-adjusted median values of these congeners were higher in the Belgian population than than those from our study population (results not shown).
20423815:34	However, the selection of infertile controls in the Belgian study may have masked an association, if present.
20423815:35	In a recent small U.S. study that adjusted for serum lipids as a covariate, as we did, reported no association between ∑PCB or estrogenic PCB concentrations and endometriosis risk.
20423815:36	The study enrolled 84 consecutive women undergoing laparoscopies at two university-affiliated hospitals in Buffalo, New York, and compared endometriosis cases ( n = 32) with women diagnosed with other gynecologic pathology or tubal sterilization and without endometriosis ( n = 52).
20423815:37	The present study has several strengths, including its population-based design and large sample size.
20423815:38	Cases and controls were all members of the same health maintenance organization, eliminating most issues pertaining to disparity of access to medical care.
20423815:39	Chosen from the well-enumerated population of GH members, the race, income, and educational profile of the control population was similar to that of other female western Washington State residents, and serum PCB concentrations were similar to the U.S. female population of reproductive age.
20423815:40	The availability of detailed questionnaire information enabled the adjustment for potential confounding effects.
20423815:41	Furthermore, we conducted analyses of individual PCB congeners in addition to ∑PCBs and estrogenic PCBs to facilitate comparison with other studies.
20423815:42	To improve the sensitivity of our study, we used a well-defined set of criteria to evaluate the certainty of endometriosis diagnosis.
20423815:43	Disease features and evidence were evaluated directly from medical records rather than relying on self-report.
20423815:44	We excluded cases without surgical confirmation of endometriosis, as well as those women with a previous history of surgically confirmed endometriosis.
20423815:45	We selected as controls a random sample of women from the GH population rather than a group of women who had undergone surgical evaluation and been diagnosed with other gynecological conditions.
20423815:46	We made this choice because of the possibility that women with other gynecological conditions, many of which are estrogen related, may not be representative of the population at risk in terms of their PCB exposure.
20423815:47	If women had abnormally high PCB levels, the use of the control group could potentially mask any true association between PCB exposure and endometriosis.
20423815:48	One consequence of our choice was that some of our controls may have had undiagnosed endometriosis.
20423815:49	The presence of undiagnosed, symptomatic endometriosis in the control group was likely to have been < 2%, resulting in a very small number of cases being misclassified as controls.
20423815:50	Partly to address this issue, we limited our case group to women with definite or probable endometriotic disease, and it is unlikely that participants with this extent of disease were included in the control group.
20423815:51	To further address the issue, in one subanalysis we excluded controls with endometriosis-type symptoms.
20423815:52	In that analysis we found no change in our effect estimates, suggesting that the potential presence of undiagnosed cases in our control group had little impact on the results of the analyses we present here.
20423815:53	The postdiagnostic assessment of exposure levels is a limitation that is characteristic of all retrospective case–control studies of blood biomarkers and chronic disease.
20423815:54	If PCB concentrations are affected by the disease, measured exposure levels may not be representative of past exposure occurring during a postulated period of causation.
20423815:55	Weight change, which may affect PCB levels, is not a typical symptom of endometriosis onset; therefore, we do not consider this type of exposure misclassification to be likely.
20423815:56	Although little information existed at the time of this study as to diets that would be effective in preventing disease recurrence, cases may nonetheless have modified their dietary habits after diagnosis.
20423815:57	If cases decreased their meat or fat intake as a result of their endometriosis diagnosis, then the PCB concentrations in our case population may be underestimates of the true prediagnosis exposure levels.
20423815:58	It is also possible that other unidentified behavioral changes may be made as a result of an endometriosis diagnosis; if these changes affect PCB levels, they may have impacted our study results.
20423815:59	There is some evidence from animal studies that exposure to high PCB concentrations can affect growth of endometrial cells ( ; ); although we cannot rule out a minimal association in our data, it is likely that exposure to higher concentrations than those observed in the present study would be required to have an appreciable impact on endometriosis risk if a causal association truly does exist.
20423815:60	Taken in context with results of other recent North American studies, our findings indicate that PCB concentrations consistent within the range of exposure currently observed in western Washington State do not contribute meaningfully to endometriosis risk.
20423815:61	If patterns of decreasing PCB body burden continue in the general U.S. population as they have since the PCB ban in 1976, our results suggest that environmental PCB exposure is likely too low to play a measurable role in the etiology of endometriosis.
20423815:62	Further evaluation in population-based studies conducted in occupational or environmental settings is needed to assess associations with higher PCB exposures.

15202945:0	Background 
In recent years there has been a renaissance in mapping malaria distribution at the national [ - ], continental  and global scales . These maps have adopted a variety of approaches and data sources in their construction.
15202945:1	The most widely cited, contemporary continental resolution map of Plasmodium falciparum transmission distribution for Africa was developed by the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) collaboration ; .
15202945:2	It has formed the basis for several reports by the Roll Back Malaria partnership  and was used during several recent estimates of the pan-African public health malaria burden to identify population's at-risk [ - ].
15202945:3	The MARA model used a fuzzy membership approach, assigning 5 × 5 km areas to a suitability estimate for stable P. falciparum transmission based upon simple rainfall and temperature determinants of the parasite's sporogonic development and mosquito survival.
15202945:4	The model did not attempt to define intensities of transmission; rather it determined the likelihood that stable transmission could occur.
15202945:5	Using the MARA model, areas of low stable and high stable endemicity across the continent have been distinguished categorically by assuming that the greater the climatic likelihood of stable transmission, the more likely areas would support higher intensities of malaria transmission . In this paper, the validity of these assumptions and the likely margins of error are examined by comparing MARA climate suitability values with empirical P. falciparum parasite prevalence survey data in Kenya.
15202945:6	Methods 
Results 
A total of 217 spatially independent parasite prevalence surveys were identified that met the selection criteria.
15202945:7	Eleven were reported in peer reviewed journals, 168 were unpublished Ministry of Health reports, NGO/bilateral/multilateral organisation reports, 16 were reported in doctoral or masters theses and 22 were provided as unpublished data by malaria scientists working in Kenya.
15202945:8	Twenty-five percent (n = 54) of the surveys were undertaken before 1990.
15202945:9	The median sample size in the childhood surveys was 220 (inter-quartile range 118, 430).
15202945:10	14.7% (n = 32) of the surveys were undertaken among age groups covering the 0–5 year age range; 61.8% (n = 134) spanned the age range 0–10 years; and 23.5% (n = 51) of surveys included children between the ages of 0 and 15 years.
15202945:11	The majority of surveys were regarded as random, longitudinal or total population surveys (65.9%, n = 143).
15202945:12	The distribution of the survey data against the categorical distinctions for the MARA FCS values is shown in Figure . 
Table compares the categorical definitions of parasite prevalence with categories of the FCS values used during recent malaria burden estimations .
15202945:13	Of the parasite surveys reporting a zero prevalence of infection, five out of eight had an FCS value greater than zero.
15202945:14	One hundred and thirty seven surveys reported parasite prevalence greater or equal to 25% ( i.e. stable endemic transmission), however only 79 (58%) had an FCS value ≥ of 0.75.
15202945:15	For surveys reporting a low parasite prevalence between 1–24% (n = 72), 58 (81%) were characterised by an FCS value >0 but less than 0.75.
15202945:16	Overall agreement between the categories was poor, k = 0.367, although statistically significant (p < 0.0001).
15202945:17	Table reflects a change in the FCS categories around 0.6 to represent zero, 1–24% and ≥25% parasite prevalence.
15202945:18	These criteria greatly improved the levels of agreement with the parasite ratio categories (k = 0.442, p < 0.000) and 68% of surveys reporting a parasite prevalence ≥25% were described by an FCS value ≥0.6.
15202945:19	Further changes in the FCS criteria made little difference to the levels of agreement.
15202945:20	Regarding the parasite prevalence and the FCS values as continuous measures produced a weak positive correlation (R 2 = 0.364, p < 0.0001; Figure ).
15202945:21	Inclusion of covariates, upper age, year of survey or sampling method did not improve the association and nor did weighting the parasite ratio by its standard error during weighted least-squares regression.
15202945:22	Discussion 
The analyses presented in this paper compare empirical parasite prevalence data among children sampled in 217 communities across Kenya with a climate-driven model that estimates the likelihood of stable malaria transmission.
15202945:23	The results of the study suggest that there is a significant linear, albeit weak, association between these two measures of P. falciparum transmission (Figure & ).
15202945:24	This is perhaps not surprising as the parasite ratio and the FCS value represent two very different transmission criteria.
15202945:25	The parasite ratio reflects the intensity of transmission and has been routinely used as a marker of endemicity in Africa since the 1950's . The FCS is a representation of the rainfall and temperature determinants of the parasite and vector's ability to coexist and thus enable stable transmission . Furthermore, the MARA FSC is based on climatological averages for the 1951–1995 period (although recent analyses suggest this to have been surprisingly stable over the last century  and the parasite rate sampled in specific years.
15202945:26	The potential confounding influence of timing on the parasite prevalence sample is an area of on-going research.
15202945:27	The positive, albeit weak, correlation with measures of the intensity of transmission lends some support for the MARA model's ability to define populations at-risk of differing intensities of malaria transmission.
15202945:28	There were too few surveys reporting zero infection prevalence (n = 8) to argue whether the FCS model can correctly distinguish areas of no transmission, however, 5 areas reporting zero prevalence did have a FCS value greater than zero.
15202945:29	More striking was the ability of the FCS categories >0 and <0.75 to correctly identify populations at low risk of malaria infection with parasite prevalence's between >0 – <25% (81%: Table ).
15202945:30	During estimations of malaria burden it has been assumed that populations residing in these areas experience much lower risks of malaria-specific morbidity and mortality compared to populations located in areas described by an FCS ≥0.75 . Conversely areas described as supporting stable, endemic transmission with parasite prevalence ≥25% were less well described using the criteria FCS ≥0.75.
15202945:31	Only 58% of the parasite prevalence surveys reporting a parasite ratio ≥25% were classified as having a FCS value ≥0.75, the remaining 42% of surveys were classified as having FCS values >0 but less than 0.75.
15202945:32	Altering the FCS criteria to ≥0.6 for stable, endemic transmission improved the classifications of parasite prevalence surveys in Kenya with 68% of surveys correctly identified (Table ).
15202945:33	Conclusions 
The results of this study suggest that applying climate suitability modelled estimates of transmission potential to distinguishing populations at differing levels of malaria infection intensity has several limitations.
15202945:34	First it may not adequately distinguish populations at no risk of infection.
15202945:35	Second, populations exposed to stable, endemic transmission may be poorly defined using criteria of ≥0.75 FCS.
15202945:36	These results relate only to Kenya and similar validations are required in other settings in Africa.
15202945:37	Nevertheless, for Kenya the disease and mortality burden of malaria will have been under-estimated using the criteria shown in Figure . The extent of higher intensity transmission resulting in higher malaria burdens could be wider and the extent of no risk might be more restricted.
15202945:38	The model developed by Craig et al .  represents the only available continental scale map upon which to define populations at risk of P. falciparum infection.
15202945:39	Our analysis suggests that, at a crude level, it does distinguish communities exposed to differing levels of malaria transmission intensity.
15202945:40	Given the large number of assumptions made regarding the paucity of attribute morbidity and mortality data to define continental scale DALY's for malaria, defining the spatial extents of population denominators is only one part of the problem that is at least soluble.
15202945:41	New malaria risk models are being developed which go beyond the climatic determinants of P. falciparum transmission and new iterations of malaria risk models will hopefully become more robust with the inclusion of new global scale data on population settlement, land use and ecology.

17006636:0	Introduction 
Open cavity mastoidectomy techniques applied for chronic otitis media cause some cavity problems.
17006636:1	These patients need life-long otologic care for the debris that accumulates due to the insufficient self-cleaning mechanism of mastoidectomy cavities.
17006636:2	Sixteen percent of ears without cavities needs cleaning, whereas this ratio climbs to 42% for ears with cavities . These patients complain of dizziness in cold weather and during swimming.
17006636:3	Other problems are non-aesthetic meatoplasty and difficulties in the placement of hearing-aid devices . 
Various obliteration and external auditory canal (EAC) reconstruction techniques have been recommended to eliminate open cavity problems.
17006636:4	Mosher was the first to use soft tissue flap in 1911 and has described the postaural subcutaneous flap technique for cavity obliteration . In the following years soft tissue flaps, free bone, cartilage grafts, autograft and synthetic filling substances have been used to reduce mastoid cavities . Mastoid cavity obliteration by neo-osteogenesis under the periosteal flap has been first shown by Kahramanyol in 1992 . This result has been my start-point and I have used inferior pedicled CMOF, which is our modification for EAC reconstruction and to reduce the volume of radical mastoidectomy cavity.
17006636:5	In addition, small meatoplasty was done to lessen aesthetic concerns.
17006636:6	Materials and methods 
Twenty-four patients (13 women and 11 men ranging in age from 12 to 51 years) were operated between 1998 and 2004.
17006636:7	Various stages of cholesteatoma were detected during preoperative otoscopy and intraoperative observations in all those patients who had otorrhea and hearing loss for years.
17006636:8	Four patients had complications such as facial paralysis, labyrinthine fistula and intracranial abscess.
17006636:9	Ossicle chain injury of various severities was present in all these participants.
17006636:10	All patients were operated under general anaesthesia.
17006636:11	Prior to operation, each patient had otoscopic examination, pure tone and speech audiometry and temporal bone CT scans.
17006636:12	Approval for radical mastoidectomy indication was granted after simple mastoidectomy and atticotomy.
17006636:13	Results 
This study was done between the years 1998 and 2004 in 24 patients.
17006636:14	All patients were followed-up for at least 2 years.
17006636:15	EACs were smooth and healthy.
17006636:16	In all patients epithelization was complete after the 2nd month of the operation.
17006636:17	None had recurrent osteitis, cholesteatoma or granulation.
17006636:18	Otoscopic examination could reveal the entire cavity in all these cases and debris and cerumen cleaning was feasible.
17006636:19	The mean volume of the new EAC on the 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th months were 0.93 ± 0.32, 1.43 ± 0.48, 1.66 ± 0.53, 1.83 ± 0.56 cm 3, respectively.
17006636:20	The canal volume measurements of the patients that we were able to follow after 24 months revealed no significant difference.
17006636:21	The evaluations of the postoperative temporal bone CT scanning revealed no retraction or displacement around, but demonstrated new bone formation obliterating the mastoid cavity behind the CMOF that was used to build the posterior wall of the EAC (Fig.  ).
17006636:22	The CMOF never displaced toward the EAC or the sigmoid sinus, and it always remained where it was placed during the operation.
17006636:23	None of our patients returned with vertigo induced by cold air or swimming.
17006636:24	No aesthetical disapproval occurred.
17006636:25	Introducing the hearing aid placements into the EAC was easy and almost natural.
17006636:26	The therapeutical results in four patients with preoperative complications were successful.
17006636:27	In one patient conchal perichondritis emerged soon after the operation and was treated with medical therapy.
17006636:28	Discussion 
Various treatments have been proposed for mastoid cavity obliteration and reconstruction . Extended meatoplasty has been used for auto-cleansing and sufficient aeration [ , ].
17006636:29	Some authors offered a small meatoplasty to avoid the inevitable aesthetic concerns stemming from a wider meatoplasty .
17006636:30	However, small meatoplasty has restricted the cavity drainage and aeration by increasing the cavity depth posteriorly.
17006636:31	In our technique a small meatoplasty became a functional continium of the almost a normal EAC anatomy that was obtained by the placement of the CMOF to the posterior edge of the meatoplasty.
17006636:32	This newly formed EAC has provided sufficient drainage and aeration, and a preferable aesthetic appearance (Fig.  ).
17006636:33	The bilateral perfusion obtained by the postauricular artery supplying the inferior pedicled CMOF and the branches of internal maxillary artery supplying the superior pedicled EAC flap have accelerated cavity healing and epithelization.
17006636:34	The absorbable gelatine sponges placed into the mastoidectomy cavity and new EAC have helped the immobilization of the CMOF by supporting it placed at the facial ridge.
17006636:35	Moreover, they have contributed to the formation of a homogenous haematoma under the CMOF.
17006636:36	Many authors have detected that haematoma at the fracture site has aided in fracture healing . Numerous callus areas emerging in interlamellar fracture lines under the CMOF have supplied both skeletal support and obliteration of the mastoidectomy cavity by neo-osteogenesis.
17006636:37	Histological investigations relating fracture-healing process have shown that intramembranous bone formation begins under the periosteum in a few days after fracture formation and bridging between fracture fragments begins in 4 weeks . We observed calcification foci indicating osteoblastic activity in histological investigations of a cavity wall biopsy taken from a patient in 6 months after surgery (Fig.  ).
17006636:38	New bone formation filling the mastoidectomy cavity under the CMOF was detected in the postoperative temporal bone CT images taken in the 1st, 12th and 24th months.
17006636:39	In a study where Palva flap was used for mastoid obliteration, the ear canal was found enlarged at both the early and the late postoperative check-up compared to the preoperative values . The results of the studies, reported by Kahramanyol et al.  in which mastoid cavities were obliterated with fascioperiosteal flap, have shown that the mastoid cavity volume was decreased by 39% due to neo-osteogenesis under fascioperiosteal flap, and that the obliteration has stayed in long term has shown radiologically . In our study it has shown a nearly twofold increase in EAC volume and no significant difference after 24th months.
17006636:40	Thus the difference in EAC volumes between the 2nd month and the 2nd year of the postoperative period was assessed as a result of shrinking of the tissues, composing the EAC, especially the periosteum.
17006636:41	Conclusion 
Some large meatoplasties performed for open cavity problems are not preferable due to non-aesthetic appearance.
17006636:42	On the other hand, small meatoplasties that are preferred to overcome this concern cause aeration and drainage problems by increasing the depth of mastoidectomy cavity posteriorly.
17006636:43	Therefore, in this study we both performed small meatoplasties to avoid the aesthetic concerns and at the same time filled the mastoid cavity up to the posterior edge of the meatoplasty to obtain efficient aeration and drainage.

Hypothyroidism is a “Pandora's Box”!
21731874:1	It can present in a myriad of ways – with classical signs in some, subtle signs in some and unusually in some patients.
21731874:2	It causes metabolic changes in several systems of the body including the muscles as well.
21731874:3	We report a case of Hoffman's syndrome, a rare form of hypothyroid myopathy, which causes proximal weakness and pseudohypertrophy of muscles.
21731874:4	C ASE R EPORT
A 20-year-old lady came to OPD with complaints of swelling and stiffness of both calf muscles which started 15 days back.
21731874:5	She complained of cramping in both calf muscles and difficulty in getting up from squatting position and climbing stairs.
21731874:6	She did not complain of cold intolerance, weight gain, increased sleep, lethargy, constipation, hoarseness of voice or menstrual disturbance.
21731874:7	On examination, her pulse rate was 62/min and BP was 120/90 mm of Hg.
21731874:8	There was an apparent hypertrophy of bilateral calf muscles (gastrocnemius) , dry coarse skin and mild diffuse goiter.
21731874:9	She had proximal muscle weakness in both lower limbs with delayed relaxation of ankle jerk.
21731874:10	There was no calf muscle tenderness.

21731874:15	ECG and chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormality.
21731874:16	The patient was diagnosed to have primary hypothyroidism complicated by hypothyroid myopathy – Hoffman's syndrome.
21731874:17	She was started on Thyroxine 50 μg od that was increased to 100 μg od after 2 weeks.
21731874:18	The patient had significant improvement in terms of biochemical parameters and clinically as well after 3 months of treatment.
21731874:19	D ISCUSSION
Hypothyroidism causes a variety of changes in the body.
21731874:20	Deficiency of thyroid hormone interferes with metabolic function by slowing it down or decreasing it.
21731874:21	These metabolic changes occur in the muscles also.
21731874:22	Pain on muscle exertion is due to defective carbohydrate metabolism.
21731874:23	Delayed muscle contraction and relaxation may be due to a change in the distribution from fast-twitch fibers to slow-twitch fibers.
21731874:24	A reduction in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as the induction of an insulin-resistant state, may result in these changes.
21731874:25	Neuromuscular symptoms are present in 30–80% of patients with hypothyroidism.
21731874:26	Patients may have muscle cramping, proximal symmetrical muscle weakness, muscle stiffness, and exercise intolerance.
21731874:27	Slowness of muscle relaxation and of muscle contraction is noted in hypothyroid myopathy.
21731874:28	Delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is due to impaired calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum, which prolongs twitch duration.
21731874:29	Deep tendon reflexes are delayed in approximately 85% of patients with hypothyroidism.
21731874:30	Mounding of the muscle after light percussion (i.e., myoedema) occurs in one-third of patients with hypothyroidism.
21731874:31	Calf muscle hypertrophy with weakness is seen in Duchenne and Becker muscle dystrophy, focal myositis, sarcoid granulomas and amyloid deposits in muscles.
21731874:32	Although muscular symptoms are common in hypothyroid patients (varying from myalgia, weakness, stiffness, cramps and easy fatigability in 30–80% of the patients), muscular hypertrophy with muscle stiffness is reported in less than 10% of the patients.
21731874:33	Pseudohypertrophy of the muscles results from accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.
21731874:34	Gastrocnemius is almost always involved as it was in our case.
21731874:35	Muscle enlargement, stiffness and cramping, proximal muscle weakness are a constellation of findings seen in these patients.
21731874:36	Hoffman's syndrome is a specific, rare form of hypothyroid myopathy, which causes proximal weakness and pseudohypertrophy of muscles.
21731874:37	In adults with hypothyroidism, these findings are known as Hoffman's syndrome.
21731874:38	In children with cretinism, they are called Kocher-Debré-Sémélaigne syndrome.
21731874:39	We are reporting this case of Hoffman's syndrome for rarity of this clinical entity.
21326956:0	Introduction 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune, systemic disease, in which various joints in the body are inflamed, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness, and the possible loss of function.
21326956:1	Pathologically, synovial proliferation and destruction of the articular cartilage and bone occur in the disease course . Free radical/reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be defined as a chemical species, an atom or a molecule that has one or more unpaired electrons in its valance shell which makes it unstable, short lived and highly reactive, therefore, for gaining stability, it attacks the nearest stable molecule “stealing” its electron.
21326956:2	When the attacked molecule looses its electron, it becomes a free radical itself, beginning a chain reaction cascade resulting in disruption of a living cell .
21326956:3	It is well established now that free radicals/ROS play an important role in chronic inflammation . Oxygen metabolism has an important role in the pathogenesis of RA.
21326956:4	Free radicals/ROS produced in the course of cellular oxidative phosphorylation and repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation, along with oxidants produced by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, lead to chronic oxidative stress in the RA synovial microenvironment and the other tissues . 
Increased oxidative stress in synovial tissue and synovial fluid may be associated with increased disease activity, tissue demage and bone erosions in RA.
21326956:5	It has been shown that, especially in RA, monocytes produce 2.7 times more oxygen radicals than controls . Clinical evidence has also suggested oxidative stress is elevated in RA patients.
21326956:6	Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), a degradation product of lipid peroxidation, level was significantly higher in the synovial fluid and serum of RA patients than that of control subjects . Epidemiologic studies have also shown an inverse association between dietary intake of antioxidants and RA incidence and inverse associations between antioxidant levels and inflammation have been found . 
A new group of autoantibodies that have generated particular interest are the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies directed to citrulline-containing proteins, which appear to be of value for the diagnosis and especially severity of RA and also closely correlated to inflammatory disease activity (Disease Activity Score-DAS28) scores and the presence, development, and extent of joint erosions . Anti-CCP antibodies are actively produced or enriched at the site of inflammation (joints and synovial tissue) and may play an active role in the pathogenesis of Anti-CCP positive RA by enhancing oxidative stress in rheumatoid joint . Indeed, high titers of anti-CCP antibodies have been associated with an erosive disease course and outcome in RA , . Anti-CCP antibodies can also induce or enhance arthritis and tisuue demage in the mouse . 
The effects of anti-CCP antibodies on whole blood, serum and synovial fluid oxidant and anti-oxidant activity in patients with RA has not been elucidated in the previous studies.
21326956:7	In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of anti-CCP antibodies in the circulation on whole blood, serum and synovial fluid oxidant and anti-oxidant capacity in patients with RA.
21326956:8	Methods 
RA patients with anti-CCP (+) (n=25) and anti-CCP (-) (n=24) were recruited into the study.
21326956:9	All patients fulfilled the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA . All patients had a positive rheumatoid factor (RF).
21326956:10	RF negative patients were excluded from the study.
21326956:11	Consent for all procedures was obtained from each individual and from the university research ethics committee.
21326956:12	Blood and synovial fluid samples were taken from the patients.
21326956:13	The patients were chosen for the study after having a preliminary evaluation consisting of a brief medical history, smoking and alcohol habits and physical examinations.
21326956:14	Inflammatory disease activity was defined as a Disease Activity Score (DAS 28).
21326956:15	All patients evaluated in terms of RF, CRP, ESR, and anti-CCP2 status.
21326956:16	DAS 28 scores, tender joint count, duration of morning stiffness.
21326956:17	Patients with any history of chronic diseases such as liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases and alchohol usage and smoking were not included in the study.
21326956:18	The patients who were under treatment with only NSAID at the study time included in the study.
21326956:19	Those who had been receiving corticosteroid agents and under treatment with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and anti-TNF or other biological agents for at least 3 months before the study date were excluded from this study.
21326956:20	Results 
The RA subjects with anti-CCP (+) were 25 individuals (18 females, 7 males), aged 39 to 63 years (mean age 54.4 ± 9.6).
21326956:21	The mean anti-CCP antibody levels was 96.72± 61.07 U/ml (mean±SD) in anti-CCP(+) group.
21326956:22	The RA patients without anti-CCP consisted of 24 individuals (19 females, 5 males), aged 42 to 62 years (mean age 56.2 ± 11.2).
21326956:23	As shown in Table RA patients with anti-CCP(+) had significantly higher DAS 28 scores, tender joint count and morning stiffness time (p<0.01) than that of those with anti-CCP(-).
21326956:24	Other demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics did not show statistically significant differences between groups.
21326956:25	There were no significant differences in terms of the mean whole blood and serum antioxidative activity (CAT, GSHpx) and the mean blood and serum MDA and MPO values (oxidative activity), between the patients with anti-CCP(+) and those with anti-CCP(-) (Table ).
21326956:26	In the synovial fluid, there was increased synovial oxidant activity (MPO and MDA levels) (p<0.05) in anti-CCP(+) patients with RA when compared with anti-CCP(-) RA patients (Table ).
21326956:27	There were no significant differences in terms of the mean synovial antioxidative activity (CAT, GSHpx) values between the patients with anti-CCP(+) and those with anti-CCP(-).
21326956:28	Spearman's correlation showed positive correlations between serum anti-CCP antibody levels and synovial MDA and MPO levels (r=0.435, p<0.05, r=0.563, p<0.05 respectively) in anti-CCP (+) group (Figure ).
21326956:29	But there were no significant correlations between anti-CCP antibody levels and whole blood and serum MPO, MDA, GSHpx and CAT levels as well as synovial GSHpx and CAT levels in anti-CCP (+) group.
21326956:30	Because of oxygen metabolism (Free radical/reactive oxygen species) is related with inflammation, to reveal the relationship between anti-CCP and synovial fluid oxygen metabolism we examined oxidative status in ESR negative patients.
21326956:31	Although, there is no clear rational cut off for activity (or for normality) of ESR in RA, the usual clinical trial activity cutpoints for ESR are 28-30 mm/h . For that reason, a cut off value for ESR negativity was assessed as 28 mm/h.
21326956:32	Ten patients in anti-CCP(+) group and 12 patients in anti-CCP(-) group were ESR negative.
21326956:33	While only ESR negative patients compared between the groups, there were no significant differences in terms of serum oxidant levels and antioxidant activity (p>0.05).
21326956:34	On the other hand, there were still significant differences between the groups in terms of synovial oxidant levels (MDA and MPO levels) (p<0.05) (Table ).
21326956:35	Moreover, there was still a significant positive correlation between serum anti-CCP and synovial fluid MPO levels [r=0.693, p<0.05- but not synovial fluid MDA levels (r=0.480, p>0.05)] in ESR negative patients of anti CCP(+) group (Figure ).
21326956:36	Discussion 
In the current study, we evaluated the relationship between serum anti-CCP antibody positivity and whole blood, serum and synovial fluid oxidant as well as antioxidant capacity in patients with RA, and we found positive correlations between anti-CCP antibody existence in circulation and increased oxidant activity (increased MDA and MPO levels) in the synovial fluids of patients with RA.
21326956:37	But no relationship between anti-CCP antibody existence and blood and serum oxidant activity and antioxidant defense system were found.
21326956:38	Also we found no significant differences in terms of the mean synovial antioxidative activity (CAT, GSHpx) values between anti-CCP(+) and anti-CCP(-) RA patients.
21326956:39	RA patients positive for anti-CCP represent a subset of RA that is characterized by an aggressive disease course, including bone erosion . Indeed, Anti-CCP is strongly associated with both prevalent tissue erosions and the development of erosions in RA joint tissues . A high disease specificity of anti-CCP coupled with reasonable sensitivity and high predictive value for RA progression and radiological damage suggest that anti-CCP may play an important role in RA pathogenesis.
21326956:40	Anti-CCP antibodies may also be related increased oxidative activity in RA patients.
21326956:41	Anti-CCP antibodies are directed against antigens containing the nonstandard amino acid citrulline, for example, citrullinated fibrin, which is found in the rheumatoid joint . The citrulline moiety, which is the essential part of the antigenic determinant in these antigens, is post-translationally generated by peptidyl arginine deiminases (PAD) . Some reults in the literature also suggest that anti-CCP may be related increased oxidative activity in RA patients.
21326956:42	For example, TNF-alpha inhibitors act as a regulator against pentosidine formation, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation and is associated with a decrease in serum levels of oxidative stress markers, and also anti-CCP antibody levels in RA patients .
21326956:43	Although the pathophysiological basis of RA is not yet fully understood, free radicals/ROS have been implicated in its pathogenesis and several studies have demonstrated increased oxidative enzyme activity along with decreased, increased or unchanged antioxidant levels in RA sera and synovial fluids - . Our study may also explain these different results in RA patients, because previous studies did not allocate the subjects according to the anti-CCP antibody positivity.
21326956:44	Antioxidants and oxidative enzymes have been shown to ameliorate arthritis in animal models . Studies of RA synovial fluid and tissue have also demonstrated oxidative damage to hyaluronic acid, low-density-lipid proteins (LDL), proteins, cartilage, extracellular collagen, and intracellular DNA .
21326956:45	These are highly reactive transient chemical species (nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OHS), with the potential to initiate cellular damage in joint tissues especially in RA.
21326956:46	They are formed by phagocyte activation during inflammation.
21326956:47	The current study showed no relationship between anti-CCP antibody existence and blood and serum antioxidant defense system (CAT, GSHpx).
21326956:48	There were no statistically differences in both groups (anti-CCP(+) and anti-CCP(-)) in terms of blood and serum oxidant activity and antioxidant defense system.
21326956:49	Cells and tissues are protected from ROS-induced damage by a variety of endogenous ROS scavenging proteins, enzymes, and chemical compounds.
21326956:50	If these ROS are not scavenged by antioxidant mechanisms, these species may lead to widespread lipid, protein, and DNA damage in cells and tissues of patients with RA . Several antioxidant systems such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and GSH-Px dependent mechanisms which have different activities have been reported.
21326956:51	SOD, the first line of defense against ROS, catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide.
21326956:52	Hydrogen peroxide can then be transformed into H2O and O2 by CAT.
21326956:53	GSH-Px is a selenoprotein which reduces lipidic or nonlipidic hydroperoxides as well as H2O2 while oxidizing glutathione . 
In this study, we found a positive correlation between anti-CCP antibody levels and increased oxidant (MDA and MPO) activity in the synovial fluid of patients with RA.
21326956:54	One of the end-products of lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage is MDA which was found to be increased because of the reduced antioxidant defense system in patients with RA.
21326956:55	Elevated levels of this end-product have been reported in the serum, plasma and synovial fluid in patients with RA . But no change in plasma MDA levels has also been reported .
21326956:56	The decreased plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels and increased MDA and erithrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in patients with RA were reported in the previous studies and may be related to the severity of RA - . MPO is a heme-containing peroxidase.
21326956:57	Enzymatically active MPO, together with hydrogen peroxide and chloride, produces the powerful oxidant hypochlorous acid and is a key contributor to the oxygen-dependent tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases . Our study showed a relationship between increased synovial fluid MPO and anti-CCP antibody positivity.
21326956:58	A previous study revealed that the levels of anti-CCP antibodies are higher in synovial fluid than in serum .
21326956:59	It was also demonstrated that antibodies to the citrullinated antigens were produced and enriched in the joints of the RA patients . This may explain why synovial fluid oxidative stress markers (MPO and MDA levels) were increased while serum oxidative stress markers were normal in this study.
21326956:60	If anti-CCP antibody levels in synovial fluid were measured, it could have been provide more information in this study.
21326956:61	But, because a limited number of our anti-CCP antibody kit, we thought to detect anti-CCP antibody levels in serum would be sufficient for the purpose of this study.
21326956:62	Limitations of the current study; i.
21326956:63	Small sample size which leads to lower statistical power.
21326956:64	ii.
21326956:65	anti-CCP antibodies were not detected in synovial fluid and iii.
21326956:66	DAS-28 scores, morning stiffness time and tender joint count at the assessment time were higher in anti-CCP(+) group.
21326956:67	In conclusion; In the current study, we found relationships between anti-CCP antibody existence and increased MPO and MDA levels (oxidant activity) in the synovial fluid of patients with RA.
21326956:68	But there were no relationships between anti-CCP antibody existence and whole blood and serum oxidant status and antioxidant defense system.
21326956:69	Anti-CCP antibody positivity seems to be associated with increased synovial fluid oxidant activity (increased MDA and MPO levels) in patients with RA.
21326956:70	And this increased oxidative activity in synovial fluid may be one of the responsible factors for accelerated bone erosions seen in anti-CCP positive RA patients.
21326956:71	These conclusions need to be validated in a larger controlled study population.

17452533:0	Introduction 
In mature B lymphocytes, binding of antigen or antireceptor antibody to the B cell receptor (BCR) complex causes a sustained rise in intracellular free Ca 2+, which, in turn, regulates proliferation and differentiation of the cells into either memory or antibody-secreting ones (for review see ).
17452533:1	The increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ arises from two successive events: first, there occurs a transient Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores initiated by a rise in free inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3; for review see ).
17452533:2	In turn, the emptying of Ca 2+ stores activates Icrac (Ca 2+ release activated) ion channels.
17452533:3	The channels are Ca 2+ permeable, and Ca 2+ influx via these channels results in a sustained elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca 2+ ( ; for review see ).
17452533:4	The molecular identity of the Icrac channels has yet to be fully determined, but recent studies demonstrate that the protein Orai1 (also called CRACM1) is an integral component of the channel and is associated with its Ca 2+ selectivity filter ( ; ).
17452533:5	Orai1, a gene product identified in severe combined immunodeficiency patients, was discovered to be important in Icrac function through RNAi screens ( ; ; ).
17452533:6	Tyrosine kinase activity is absolutely required for activation of the BCR–Ca 2+ signaling pathway (for review see ).
17452533:7	In the absence of kinase function, the sequence of molecular events linking BCR activation to IP 3 production fails because the normal phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ, the enzyme that produces IP 3, does not occur.
17452533:8	The BCR complex is a multimer consisting of membrane Ig associated with Ig α/β heterodimers.
17452533:9	The BCR complex interacts with and is phosphorylated by one or more of the following members of the Src kinase family: Lyn, Fyn, and/or Blk.
17452533:10	In addition to the Src kinase family, two other tyrosine kinases participate in the BCR–Ca 2+ signaling pathway: Syk (Syk family) and Btk (Tec family).
17452533:11	All three tyrosine kinase families participate in PLCγ activation.
17452533:12	Furthermore, tyrosine kinase–dependent activation of PLCγ is facilitated by adaptor or linker proteins such as Blnk (for review see ).
17452533:13	Whether these enzymes play a role in the events that link the emptying of Ca 2+ stores to Icrac activation has not been investigated directly.
17452533:14	However, indirect studies using pharmacological blockers of tyrosine kinase function have suggested that the enzymes may play a role in linking Ca 2+ store release and Ca 2+ influx ( , ).
17452533:15	In this study, we provide direct evidence of a role for kinases in the link between Ca 2+ store emptying and Icrac activation, and we identify some of the specific enzymes involved.
17452533:16	Two general classes of mechanisms have been proposed to link the store release of Ca 2+ to Icrac activation.
17452533:17	The first class proposes that Icrac channels are structurally linked to the Ca 2+-containing stores and that their activation depends on a conformational coupling between the store and the plasma membranes ( ; ; ).
17452533:18	The second class of mechanisms proposes that second messenger molecules accomplish this link through Ca 2+-dependent activation of target proteins.
17452533:19	Over time, several plausible messenger proteins have been proposed: G proteins ( ; ; ; ), PKC, tyrosine kinases ( ; ; ), Ca 2+ influx factor ( ; ), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, and cytochrome P-450.
17452533:20	Recently, however, a compelling case has been developed that identifies stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) as a messenger protein between Ca 2+ release and Icrac gating ( ; ; ).
17452533:21	Simultaneous overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1 but not either alone facilitates the activation of Icrac.
17452533:22	STIM1 is a membrane-bound Ca 2+-binding protein (its structure includes an EF hand) located in the ER.
17452533:23	STIM1 acts as a Ca 2+ sensor: store Ca 2+ depletion causes STIM1 to cluster as discrete aggregates (puncta) that relocalize to ER membrane areas juxtaposed to the plasma membrane.
17452533:24	STIM1 puncta colocalize with Orai1, and Ca 2+ release–activated channels open at or near the sites where this protein nexus forms ( ; ).
17452533:25	To further our understanding of the mechanisms that couple Ca 2+ store release to Icrac gating, we investigated the features of Icrac and Ca 2+ store release in a chicken B lymphocytic cell line, DT40, in which the expression of specific kinases can be genetically manipulated ( ; ; ).
17452533:26	Our results indicate that Lyn or Syk tyrosine kinases are absolutely required to link the Ca 2+ released from intracellular stores to Icrac gating: when the simultaneous expression of the enzymes is genetically suppressed, Icrac is not activated by the release of intracellular Ca 2+ stores.
17452533:27	This effect is reversible and specific and can be mimicked by the application of drugs that suppress kinase enzymatic activity in wild-type cells.
17452533:28	The kinase effects do not arise from changes in the expression levels of either Orai1 or STIM1.
17452533:29	Moreover, the release of Ca 2+ does not change the level of the phosphorylation of Syk, a measure of its enzymatic activity, and only small changes are detected in Lyn.
17452533:30	Therefore, tonic signals that generate small pools of phospho-Lyn and -Syk appear to be required for Icrac activation.
17452533:31	Results 
To investigate the role of tyrosine kinases in the molecular mechanisms underlying Icrac activation, we studied the electrophysiological properties of wild-type and genetically modified DT40 cells engineered to suppress the expression of specific proteins of interest.
17452533:32	Discussion 
In B lymphocytes, binding of antigen or antireceptor antibody to the BCR complex recruits and activates tyrosine kinases as part of the events that lead to the production of IP 3 ( ; ; for reviews see ; ).
17452533:33	Results presented in the current study indicate that these kinases also play a role in the link between the IP 3-dependent release of Ca 2+ from ER intracellular stores and activation of the Icrac ion channels in the plasma membrane.
17452533:34	We compared the electrophysiological features of Icrac and changes in free cytoplasmic Ca 2+ between wild-type and Lyn- and Syk-deficient DT40 cells and found that cells simultaneously lacking Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases fail to activate Icrac after the release of Ca 2+ stores.
17452533:35	Interestingly, the genetic deletion of either enzyme alone did not prevent Icrac activation, revealing redundancy in the biological function of these kinases in this response.
17452533:36	The physiological effects on Icrac and cytoplasmic Ca 2+ flux of pharmacological blockers of these enzymes leads us to suggest that the enzymes may operate in a sequential cascade with the Src family enzyme (Lyn) upstream from Syk.
17452533:37	The failure to activate Icrac in the Lyn- and Syk-deficient cells reflects that protein phosphorylation is a required event in the mechanism that couples the emptying of Ca 2+ stores to channel activation or in the function of the channels themselves.
17452533:38	These alternatives cannot now be unequivocally discerned.
17452533:39	There are no previous studies on the electrical properties of lymphocytes with the genetically suppressed expression of tyrosine kinases.
17452533:40	However, the hypothesis that tyrosine kinases may play a role in the link between Ca 2+ store release and Icrac activation has been proposed previously ( ; ; ).
17452533:41	Lymphocytes of mice in which the Btk-related Itk tyrosine kinase is knocked out respond to T cell receptor activation with a normal release of intracellular Ca 2+ stores, but Icrac activation by TG is less than in wild-type animals.
17452533:42	In addition to observations in animals subjected to genetic manipulation, a possible role for tyrosine kinases in lymphocyte Ca 2+ transduction paths has been suggested by experimental observations of some effects of the pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity ( ; ; ; ).
17452533:43	Currently, the mechanisms that couple Ca 2+ store release to Icrac gating fall into two main categories: (1) physical coupling mechanisms propose that activation of the IP 3 receptors are directly linked through conformational changes to the opening of Icrac channels.
17452533:44	An alternative form of physical coupling, the vesicle fusion hypothesis proposes a fusionlike event between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membranes that delivers Icrac channels or their activators to the plasma membrane.
17452533:45	Vesicle fusion is mediated by SNARE proteins.
17452533:46	(2) Messenger mechanisms propose that the released Ca 2+ is detected by particular cytoplasmic Ca 2+ sensor molecules that, in turn, gate channel activity.
17452533:47	The direct coupling hypothesis was developed to explain findings that Icrac fails to occur after pharmacological treatments expected to disrupt cytoskeletal elements (for example, cytochalasin D , calyculin A , 2APB , or clostridium C3 transferase injection ).
17452533:48	Direct coupling supposes that molecular receptors in the ER membranes, IP 3 receptors, or ryanodine receptors are linked to Icrac activation through conformational changes.
17452533:49	In lymphocytes in particular, this hypothesis is unlikely because mutant DT40 cells lacking all IP 3 receptor isoforms exhibit normal TG-activated Icrac and ryanodine receptor knockout animals have normal T cell activation.
17452533:50	The vesicle fusion hypothesis (for review see ) was developed to explain the fact that interference with the function of all or even some of the various proteins that constitute the SNARE complex can block TG-dependent Ca 2+ elevation.
17452533:51	Although it is evident that SNARE protein can alter the cell's Ca 2+ response, it remains questionable whether their specific activation by IP 3-linked events is required in the course of normal events linking Ca 2+ store release and Icrac gating.
17452533:52	Recent studies have identified two novel proteins, STIM1 and Orai1, that participate in the signaling between store Ca 2+ release and Icrac activation ( ; ; ).
17452533:53	They are both integral membrane proteins located either in the ER membrane (STIM1) or in the plasma membrane (Orai1).
17452533:54	Their simultaneous coexpression enhances Ca 2+-dependent Icrac gating.
17452533:55	These may be the first identified constituents of a larger family of proteins involved in the linkage between Ca 2+ store release and channel gating.
17452533:56	The results we present here firmly indicate that the link between the release of Ca 2+ stores and Icrac activation in B cells also involves protein phosphorylation catalyzed by cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases.
17452533:57	The target of phosphorylation remains to be identified in future work; it could be STIM1, Orai1, or other proteins yet to be discovered.
17452533:58	However, we have demonstrated that kinase activity does not affect the expression levels of STIM1 or Orai1.
17452533:59	We emphasize that our results suggest that the state of phosphorylation of a target protein is important, but we have no evidence, nor do we suggest that Ca 2+ sensing or channel gating is mediated by phosphorylation.
17452533:60	We assayed kinase autophosphorylation as an index of enzymatic activity.
17452533:61	Our biochemical results reveal that the activity of one of the critical kinases (Syk) does not change with Ca 2+ release, whereas the other (Lyn) changes only by a small extent and with a slow time course.
17452533:62	We propose that phosphorylation is required as a tonic signal that sustains the normal function of its target protein rather than a phasic signal activated in the course of Ca 2+ release, Ca 2+ sensing, or channel gating.
21829343:0	Introduction 
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family – is one of the largest class of transporters known and they are expressed ubiquitously in all kingdoms of life – . The members of this family play essential roles in many cellular processes, as they couple the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis to the transport of an enormous variety of solutes, or allocrites, (such as, inorganic ions, peptides, lipids, antibiotics, pharmacological drugs) across cellular membranes against the concentration gradient.
21829343:1	Human ABC transporters are involved in several genetic diseases (such as bleeding disorders eye and liver diseases and cystic fibrosis ).
21829343:2	There are several ABC transporters in humans that, when over expressed, confer resistance to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic drugs . Additionally, several ABC transporters have also been implicated in antibiotic resistance in bacteria drug resistance in fungi and herbicide resistance in plants . 
ABC transporters comprise importers, which translocate allocrites to the cellular interior, and exporters, which do the opposite.
21829343:3	Until now, importers have only been found in prokaryotes, whereas exporters are ubiquitously expressed in all kingdoms . Independently of the transport directionality, ABC transporters are usually composed by a minimum “functional core” formed by four modules: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two catalytic domains (NBDs).
21829343:4	All four basic domains can be expressed as separated polypeptides or can be fused together, virtually in all possible combinations . 
The molecular architecture of ABC transporters is nowadays well established (manly due to X-ray crystallography studies) and it is generally accepted that the TMDs recognize and provide the passageway for allocrites across the membrane, whereas the NBDs bind/hydrolyze ATP and power the transport.
21829343:5	The low sequence conservation of the TMDs is thought to reflect the large diversity of allocrites transported, while the NBDs high sequence and structure conservation may suggest a conserved powering mechanism for all ABC transporters (both importers and exporters).
21829343:6	The NBDs are always located in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and are formed by two distinct sub-domains (the RecA-like and the helical sub-domains).
21829343:7	Each sub-domain contains several characteristic sequence motifs associated with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (e.g. the P-loop, ABC signature motif, A-loop, H-loop and Walker B motifs) . The two NBDs form a head-to-tail dimer with the two nucleotide molecules bound at the interface between the P-loop of one monomer and the ABC signature motif of the other . Additionally to the four basic domains, ABC importers require a supplementary substrate binding protein, whose function is to capture the allocrite molecules and to deliver them to the transmembrane face of the transporter .
21829343:8	Based on the comparison of several full-length X-ray structures for both importers – and exporters – it is now clear that the structures for these two types of ABC transporters differ significantly, mainly in the transmembrane region.
21829343:9	Nevertheless, a general transport mechanism has been hypothesized based on the NBDs similarity throughout the family and in the existence of “coupling helices” in the TMDs (small α-helices oriented parallel to the membrane which directly interact with the NBDs), both in importers and exporters.
21829343:10	In this unified mechanism, the ATP energy (whether from binding and/or hydrolysis) is converted into conformational changes, which are then transmitted from the NBDs to the TMDs, ultimately allowing active transport of the allocrites . 
The maltose/maltodextrin uptake system from E. coli is one of the best functionally characterized ABC transporters, importing maltooligosaccharides up to seven glucose units long .
21829343:11	This import system is formed by two different integral membrane proteins (MalF and MalG), two copies of an ABC module (MalK) and a periplasmatic binding protein (MalE) (see ).
21829343:12	In this transporter, the ABC monomers (MalK) differ from the majority of other ABC ATPases, since they contain an extra regulatory domain (RD) in the C-terminus region, additionally to the highly conserved NBD (see ).
21829343:13	The RD, which is about 135 residues long, is known to interact with regulatory proteins, such as the transcriptional regulator MalT or the enzyme IIA (a glucose-specific permease from the glucose-phosphotransferase system – ).
21829343:14	The RDs play a key role in the stabilization of the NBD dimer and, based on the X-ray structures available for the MalK dimer , – (from different organisms and crystallized in several nucleotide-bound conditions), it is now possible to have a detailed view of the NBD dimer functioning mechanism and to understand the molecular basis of the increased stability of the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound MalK dimer.
21829343:15	This increased stability is associated with the subunit-subunit interactions involving the RDs of both monomers . In the nucleotide-free MalK dimer structure , the NBD regions are separated (to different degrees depending whether they are in the open or semi-open state) and the dimer is solely maintained by contacts between the C-terminal RDs.
21829343:16	Upon ATP binding , the helical sub-domains move forward and close the NBD dimer (with the ATP molecules trapped in the binding sites).
21829343:17	Despite the large amount of experimental data available for the ABC transporter family (including high-resolution X-ray structures for several full-length members – ), many fundamental questions are still waiting to be answered.
21829343:18	In particular, how is the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis converted into mechanical work, in order to allow unidirectional allocrite transport and how are the conformational rearrangements induced by ATP hydrolysis transmitted from the NBDs to the TMDs, allowing allocrite passage.
21829343:19	Understanding the detailed mechanism of transport requires the knowledge of the transporter dynamics and associated conformational changes.
21829343:20	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques (with sufficient simulation time and conformational sampling) are a good way to study the dynamic behavior of the transporters.
21829343:21	In the last decade, several studies using MD simulations have been reported (including by ourselves ) for several isolated ABC domains – or for complete ABC members – aiming, not only to study the dynamic behavior of the ABC proteins, but also the structural transitional pathways between conformations.
21829343:22	Some of these works even used the isolated ATPase domains of the maltose transporter as a model . A recent work from our laboratory reported ATP hydrolysis dependent conformational changes in a complete prokaryotic exporter.
21829343:23	Besides conformational changes in the NBDs themselves, mostly in the helical sub-domains (similarly to what was observed in our studies on isolated NBDs ), we saw evidences of conformational changes in the TMDs, especially in the zones of the extra-cellular loops and the coupling helices.
21829343:24	Additionally, we saw, in the post-hydrolysis state only, NBD dimer dissociation.
21829343:25	The main objective of this work is to map the short time scale response (<50 ns) of an ABC importer to nucleotide hydrolysis and inorganic phosphate exit.
21829343:26	For this purpose, we simulated the MalFGK 2E complex in three intermediate states of the ATP-catalytic cycle: a pre-hydrolysis state (with two ATP molecules bound in the nucleotide binding sites), a post-hydrolysis state (with two ADPs and two inorganic phosphate species bound) and a post-IP exit state (with two ADPs bound).
21829343:27	In order to reduce the known sampling problem in MD simulation of proteins ten 50-ns replicates were performed for each system.
21829343:28	Based on our simulations, and using the maltose uptake system as a prototype for importers, we were able to identify the ATP-dependent conformational changes, as well as the residues responsible for inter-domain communication in ABC importers.
21829343:29	Additionally, we compared the major conformational changes observed for the maltose importer with our previous study on an ABC exporter in order to infer about a potentially general communication mechanism in the ABC transporter family.
16042770:0	Background 
17α-Estradiol (17α-E2) has long been considered as the hormonally inactive isomer of 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) useful in determining the hormonal specificity of response to 17β-E2 . Consequently, it has been generally accepted that 17α-E2 is devoid of genomic estrogenic effects [ - ].
16042770:1	Nevertheless, in the past few years it has been documented that 17α-E2 may induce genomic effects such as partial estrogenic activity [ - ].
16042770:2	In addition, this estrogen possesses important nongenomic (membrane) actions by inducing neuroprotective  and mitochondrial protective  effects, as well as relaxing effects in isolated vascular [ - ], uterine  and urinary  smooth muscle.
16042770:3	In this respect it is reasonable to assume that, 17α-E2 may play a relevant physiological role, but little attention has been paid to examine its potential regulatory function.
16042770:4	On the other hand, the available data have shown that 17α-E2 is the predominant estrogen in some mammals, whereas only few studies exist concerning the detection of 17α-E2 in humans which has only been found in the urine and serum at low concentrations [reviewed in ].
16042770:5	However, is important to highlight that 17α-E2 is used as an ingredient of estrogen replacement therapy and hormone replacement therapy applied in the treatment of peri- and post-menopausal women . 
Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the feasible actions of 17α-E2 in the uterine tissue.
16042770:6	Specifically, we have examined the possible effects of this hormone on both nongenomic and genomic actions in the rat uterus: (1) some studies were performed on uterine contractile activity by using a well established isometric system for isolated tissue.
16042770:7	The effects were observed by application of 17α-E2 on the spontaneous and KCl-induced myometrial contraction.
16042770:8	The mechanism of action of 17α-E2 was delineated to determine if its potential relaxing effect on uterine contractility is genomically mediated or if this estrogen is interacting with membrane proteins (calcium channels and/or adrenoceptors); and (2) on the basis that some natural stereoisomers, as in the case of testosterone and epitestosterone which elicit nongenomic uterine relaxing action  and only epitestosterone has antiandrogenic activity [ - ], the estradiol isomers, 17α- and 17β-E2, should also induce agonist-antagonist activities.
16042770:9	Thus, we have quantified estrogenicity and antiestrogenicity in a classical sense, determining these actions on uterine wet weigh.
16042770:10	Accordingly, this study set out to investigate the potential antagonist (antiestrogenic) activity of 17α-E2 on the uterotrophic response induced by 17β-E2.
16042770:11	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The results of the present study demonstrate that 17α-E2 is a natural estrogen hormonally active in the rat uterine tissue.
16042770:12	Our findings show that this estrogen is capable of inducing both nongenomic (antiuterotonic effect) and genomic (estrogenic/antiestrogenic effect) action.
16042770:13	This evidence may, in fact, account for its potential regulatory biological function.
16042770:14	In particular, 17α-E2 elicits inhibition of uterine contractile activity by inducing antiuterotonic responses on spontaneous and KCl-induced contraction.
16042770:15	These findings are in line with a previous study in isolated rat uterus, which reported that 17α-E2 has the ability to produce relaxation on contractions induced by KCl, calcium and vanadate . We observed that 17α-E2-induced inhibition was significantly different as compared to its 17β isomer, with about 10-fold lower potency than 17β-E2, implying a partial agonist effect of 17α-E2 on uterine contractile activity.
16042770:16	Nevertheless, this inhibitory effect could be relevant to promote uterine quiescence during pregnancy.
16042770:17	Admittedly, the concentrations of the inhibitory responses to 17α- and 17β-E2 may be in pharmacological ranges; however, these are close to the therapeutic doses used.
16042770:18	Regarding the mode of action of 17α-E2-induced uterine relaxation, it is important to emphasize that the instantaneous relaxing effect of 17α-E2, plus the evidence that the effect disappears after the estrogen is removed from the tissue, are uncharacteristic of classical genomic activities.
16042770:19	Thus, this effect is presumably through nongenomic (membrane) actions.
16042770:20	This idea is supported by the fact that the observed effect of 17α-E2 on uterine contractility occurred within 1 min of its addition, and 1 min is not enough time for genomic effects to occur . Another approach to discriminate between genomic and nongenomic action is to use antihormones that bind to the intracellular steroid receptor, but that do not block the rapid membrane effects.
16042770:21	Our results show that 17α-E2 on rat uterus does not seem to be mediated by genomic events since the antiestrogens, tamoxifen or ICI 182,780, and the transcriptional and translational inhibitors did not antagonize the uterine inhibitory effect of 17α-E2.
16042770:22	This observation is in partial agreement with the study of Gutiérrez and coworkers , where it was also found that the relaxation induced by 17α-E2 on KCl-induced contraction was not blocked by tamoxifen, but differed by the fact that 17α-E2-induced relaxation was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, where an interaction with transcriptional ways was suggested.
16042770:23	This apparent discrepancy may be explained because their evaluation was done under special experimental conditions; rats were estrogen-primed for 24 h.
16042770:24	In this way, the administration of 17β-E2 results in changes of density and distribution of several receptors (proteins), called estrogen-dependent receptors, which are enhanced under conditions of estrogen dominance and, consequently, this treatment may modify the physiological response.
16042770:25	In contrast, our data were obtained on spontaneous contractility of rats in diestrus, a model close to the physiological condition.
16042770:26	Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the relaxing effect of 17α-E2 is too fast and reversible, a point of discussion to distinguish if the transcriptional process is or not involved.
16042770:27	Indeed, our findings indicate that 17α-E2 has a nongenomic action to induce myometrial relaxation, as previously reported to progestins and androgens in rat  and humans . Likewise, our study has shown different sensitivity of uterine tissue to 17α- and 17β-E2-induced relaxation, suggesting a specific relaxing efficacy for each isomer.
16042770:28	In this sense, we have reported before the presence of large differences in uterine relaxing potency in a series of closely related steroids, such as androgens and progestins, some of them without effect [ - ], pointing to a defined structure-activity relationship.
16042770:29	Nevertheless, it is important to consider that not only is the uterine muscle the target of 17α-E2 to induce relaxation but also other types of smooth muscles such as those in the blood vessels [ - ] and bladder  are relaxed by this estrogen.
16042770:30	In view that the uterine relaxing effect of 17α-E2 can be explained by a nongenomic action, this effect may be associated with different sites of action at the cell surface (e.g. membrane proteins).
16042770:31	In this respect, the possibility of an interaction of 17α-E2 with inhibitory β 2-adrenoceptors can be dismissed since its specific antagonist (propranolol) did not block the uterine relaxing effect of 17α-E2.
16042770:32	This evidence indicates that 17α-E2 induced a nonadrenergic inhibitory response on uterine contractility.
16042770:33	Since the involvement of β 2-adrenoceptors seems improbable, the possibility has to be discussed finally that the nongenomic-relaxing effect of 17α-E2 involves a diminution on the intracellular concentration of calcium in the smooth muscle cells.
16042770:34	In this connection, our preliminary results show that the efficacy induced by 17α-E2 was more prominent to antagonize contractions induced by calcium in depolarized tissues than to inhibit the spontaneous contractility.
16042770:35	In this context, it is known that KCl depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-operated calcium channels, resulting in calcium entry.
16042770:36	Consequently, the inhibition induced by 17α-E2 in uterine rings precontracted by KCl and the marked antagonism of calcium entry in depolarized tissues are implying a direct reduction of extracellular calcium influx by producing inactivation of voltage-operated calcium channels.
16042770:37	This hypothesis has also been proposed to the nongenomic relaxing effect of progestins and androgens in uterine [ - ] and vascular  smooth muscle.
16042770:38	In support of this view, it has been reported that 17α-E2 might behave as a calcium channel antagonist in vascular cells  and this estrogen may also induce a reduction on voltage-dependent calcium currents in vascular smooth muscle cells . Obviously, further patch-clamp experiments on uterine smooth muscle cells will be required to evaluate this issue.
16042770:39	It is also tempting to suggest that the nongenomic relaxing effect of 17α-E2 could be mediated through a subpopulation of the classical estrogen receptor (ER), ERα and ERβ, that is located at the plasma membrane  and specifically identified in caveolae and cell membranes from endothelial cells .
16042770:40	However, this possibility appears not to be supported by the fact that endogenous membrane and nuclear ER was found to be the same protein  and a much weaker affinity of 17α-E2 to the human ER compared to 17β-E2 has been shown . In this context, our experimental evidence that two ER antagonists (tamoxifen or ICI 182,780) did not block 17α-E2-induced uterine relaxation implies that the estrogen binding site at the myometrial cell membrane could be a protein unrelated to the ERα or ERβ.
16042770:41	Thus, the present findings indicate that 17α-E2 also acts at the cell surface of myometrial cells to initiate rapid, nongenomic, responses and this action may be mediated by interaction of estrogen with calcium channel proteins, which produces inactivation of voltage-operated calcium channels.
16042770:42	Taken together these findings, it is important to consider that a nonspecific effect may also occur for the uterine relaxing effect of 17α-E2, such as changes in membrane fluidity.
16042770:43	Although 17α-E2 had been considered without estrogenic activity [ - ], we confirmed that 17α-E2 presents a significant weak estrogenic activity by inducing increase on uterine weight; this activity is much less potent than that induced by 17β-E2 and did not achieve full estrogenicity at higher doses.
16042770:44	Consistent with this observation, it has also been reported that 17α-E2 induces light estrogenic activity [ - ].
16042770:45	However, to our knowledge, no evidence had been shown on the action of 17α-E2 as antagonist.
16042770:46	Remarkably, we have now demonstrated that 17α-E2 possesses antiestrogenic properties by antagonizing the uterotrophic response of 17β-E2, and we believe it plays an important role in estrogen-mediated uterine physiology.
16042770:47	Furthermore, there is also the possibility that 17α-E2 should induce antiestrogenic activity in several tissues as well as in other species, including human; however, additional experiments are needed in order to address this question.
16042770:48	The uterotrophic response of 17β-E2 was significantly antagonized by 17α-E2 at all doses ratios, although its antagonism was not dose-dependent at a dosage of 0.9 to 30 μM/Kg, with a maximal effect of ~30% of inhibition.
16042770:49	Indeed, this may indicate that 17α-E2 acts as a partial antagonist of ER.
16042770:50	Interestingly, the antiuterotrophic efficacy of 17α-E2 turned out similar to the antiuterotrophic action of tamoxifen, in a range of doses ratios from 1:2 to 1:10, as previously reported .
16042770:51	It is of note that the reduced efficacy of 17α-E2 to induce uterine relaxation and estrogenic activity, as compared with 17β-E2, is similar to that induced by tamoxifen, which deserves further consideration.
16042770:52	In the first instance, tamoxifen is also capable of eliciting uterine relaxation [ - ]; consequently, this antiestrogen has been reported to have some nonreceptor-mediated effects  by unclear mechanisms.
16042770:53	Moreover, since the ER is essential for 17β-E2-induced uterine proliferative responses , the present data suggest that 17α-E2 appears to regulate its slight agonist (estrogenic) and antagonist (antiestrogenic) activity through the same mechanism as tamoxifen.
16042770:54	Recently, it has been documented that tamoxifen displays partial agonist-antagonist activities in different tissues and cells, and these differences may be related to the milieu of ER coactivators and corepressors in these tissues.
16042770:55	The ER has two transcriptional activation domains, AF-1 and AF-2; thus, AF-1 activity is stimulated by tamoxifen binding to induce its partial agonist activity but AF-2 is inhibited when tamoxifen acts as antagonist [ - ].
16042770:56	With this line of evidence, could be reasonable to speculate that the mode of action of tamoxifen could be analogous for the agonist and antagonist properties of 17α-E2.
16042770:57	Obviously, further studies that fall beyond the scope of the present investigation will be required to explore the agonistic-antagonistic mechanism of 17α-E2.
16042770:58	The present study revealed that both estradiol isomers, 17α- and 17β-E2, possess the same nongenomic action by inducing uterine relaxation but 17α-E2 is incapable of antagonizing the 17β-E2-induced uterine relaxation.
16042770:59	Collaterally, these two isomers may also induce the same genomic action by eliciting an estrogenic uterotrophic response; however, the estrogenic activity of 17β-E2 is antagonized by 17α-E2.
16042770:60	In this context, this evidence is correlated with the biological action emerged to other natural isomers, such as testosterone and epitestosterone which present the same nongenomic relaxing action , but only epitestosterone possesses a genomic antiandrogenic activity [ - ].
16042770:61	Finally, we also noted that the different structural conformation of both estradiol isomers could be important to induce diverse responses.
16042770:62	The differences between both molecules is the α/ trans or β/ cis configuration at C-17.
16042770:63	Thus, estrogen antagonistic activity of 17α-E2 could be presumed by its α/ trans configuration, in contrast to the β/ cis which is responsible for the marked antiuterotonic and estrogenic activity induced by 17β-E2.
16042770:64	Conclusion 
The preliminary investigation presented here reveals interesting features of the uterine function regulated by 17α-E2.
16042770:65	The data indicate that this estrogen is an agonist inducing nongenomically mediated uterine relaxation, but also appears to have mixed agonist-antagonist activity on uterine growth, presumably through genomic processes.
16042770:66	This study shows that a rapid nongenomic action (antiuterotonic response) of 17α-E2 takes place before its genomic action (uterotrophic-antiuterotrophic response).
16042770:67	Additionally, this evidence could account for our knowledge of effects produced by 17α-E2 and some sulfate derivatives, which are components applied in the treatment of peri- and post-menopausal women.

null:0	Background 
The need to limit discovertebral constraints without restricting the patient's everyday activities during episodes of lumbar pain has led to the production of a standard model brace.
null:1	The brace's design and functions target sagittal balance through trunk reposition, spinal flexion reduction, and lordosis maintenance without putting pressure on the posterior joints.
null:2	The 4 clinical and experimental studies presented below confirm the importance of this orthosis.
null:3	Clinical test 1 objective 
The first objective is to evaluate the effects of wearing a LORDACTIV orthosis during pain experienced by patients suffering from degenerative lumbar conditions.
null:4	Methods 
113 patients suffering from lumbago were fitted with a corset (56 women and 57 men) with an average age of 42 years, presenting on average with 8 months of persistent lumbar pain or radiculitis (intensity 7.3/10 on the Visual Analog Scale).
null:5	Simple X-rays and an MRI allowed the following to be distinguished: discopathy (black appearance in T2 for discs L4L5 and/or L5S1), 44 cases, average age 38 years; inflammatory disc degeneration (MODIC 1) 21 cases, average age 50 years; disc hernia, 33 cases, average age 42 years; spondylolisthesis, 15 cases, average age 44 years.
null:6	The corset was worn 8 hours per day for 4 weeks, and no sick leave was given.
null:7	Pain evaluation was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale.
null:8	Results 
The VAS average result after 4 weeks was 1.5/10, representing a pain reduction of 80%.
null:9	The patients judged this result 'good' or 'very good' in 78% of cases.
null:10	Regarding the different conditions studied, the greatest VAS reduction was for spondylolisthesis (7.3), followed by discopathy (6.5), MODIC discopathy (5.2), and finally disc hernias (5).
null:11	Conclusion 
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the LORDACTIV orthosis for pain reduction in cases of degenerative lumbar conditions.
null:12	Clinical test 2 objective 
The second objective is to compare spinal extension and flexion in patients wearing LORDACTIV, a conventional lumbar support belt, and no orthosis.
null:13	Methods 
Rachimetric tests were performed on 39 patients suffering from lumbar pain divided equally between disc herniation (DH), spondylolisthesis by isthimic lysis (SPD), discopathy (DISCO), degenerative discopathy (MODIC 1), and mechanical sacroiliac conditions (SI).
null:14	Patients wore either the LORDACTIV orthosis or a traditional orthosis.
null:15	In the experimental procedure, 6 patients suffering from lumbar pain with discopathy (normal or inflammatory) had to stand on a force platform with their eyes closed (hands by their sides) minimizing their movements, with or without an orthosis.
null:16	Results 
The results show that restriction in spinal column flexion is only significant with lordosis (63% for degenerative lumbar conditions) compared to traditional boned belts, which even facilitate flexion in the case of spondylolisthesis.
null:17	For patients standing on the platform, the reduction of movement of the center of gravity demonstrates a reduction in body movements in patients wearing the LORDACTIV brace.
null:18	The correction initiation time is shorter with LORDACTIV (the time lapse from the moment the subject moves away from the reference position before correcting their posture) compared with the flexible belt.
null:19	This means that patients in the LORDACTIV brace correct disruptions in balance more quickly.
null:20	Conclusion 
These results show the importance of the LORDACTIV ® orthosis in stabilizing the posture of patients suffering from lumbar pain compared to a traditional support belt.
null:21	The patient's balance strategy is improved, which could be at the origin of spinal stabilization, passive structure relief (intervertebral discs, ligaments, joints), therefore having an analgesic effect.

19116026:0	Background 
Developing countries continue to lose substantial numbers of trained physicians to developed countries.
19116026:1	In light of growing awareness of the adverse impact of physician movement, a few developing countries have asked destination countries to financially compensate the countries of origin for losses  and a few developed countries have proposed ethically appropriate methods of recruiting physicians.
19116026:2	These efforts notwithstanding, interventions by developed countries to prevent this 'brain drain' are likely to be limited by their need for physicians, along with concerns about protecting physicians' right to mobility.
19116026:3	Given the likely small potential impact of existing measures to address the potential impacts of emigration on health service delivery, developing countries need to understand and identify characteristics of migrating physicians that can help better target strategies to prevent loss of physicians due to emigration.
19116026:4	Though physician 'brain drain' has been long recognized, designing interventions to address it, such as mechanisms of funding of medical education, and establishment of new medical schools, has been constrained by a limited understanding of this phenomenon, usually stemming from the unavailability of detailed data.
19116026:5	Some studies have focused on qualitatively assessing the reasons for physician emigration while others studies have documented the extent of migration.
19116026:6	Recently, Mullan combined information from medical registers in individual countries to quantitatively assess the magnitude of migration using "emigration factors" – the ratio of the absolute numbers of migrating physicians to the total number of registered physicians in the home country.
19116026:7	However, the usage of aggregate emigration factors can obscure the true impact of physician migration on sending countries, if source countries are relatively better off in terms of physician supply, or human development performance.
19116026:8	The use of aggregate emigration factors can also be misleading if the individuals who emigrate are better trained and thus, embody higher levels of human capital, than those who remain.
19116026:9	Understanding the quality of physicians who join the work-force is also important for developed countries, given patients' and policymakers' concerns about the quality of physicians trained in developing countries.
19116026:10	We assess whether the quality of medical training received in India is related to physician emigration to the United States and the United Kingdom for individuals graduating between 1955 and 2002 from Indian medical colleges.
19116026:11	India offers a particularly interesting case for assessing the linkage between the quality of medical training and the likelihood of emigration.
19116026:12	It has a large number of medical colleges managed by a diverse set of authorities, ranging from entities overseen by the central government, various state governments and municipal corporations to private trusts, with considerable variation in sources of funding and budgets.
19116026:13	Institutions of "national importance" such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are funded primarily from central government budgets and there are medical colleges heavily subsidized by state and municipal governments.
19116026:14	Medical colleges operate by private trusts, which have seen a rapid expansion in the last three decades, are funded mainly by student contributions.
19116026:15	The generally lax regulatory environment within which this recent rapid expansion has occurred, has also allowed for considerable inter-college heterogeneity in terms of teaching faculty, access to hospitals, and academic standards for incoming and graduating students.
19116026:16	To our knowledge, this is the first study linking emigration of physicians with the quality of medical training received by them.
19116026:17	Methods 
Results 
An estimated 575,000 students graduated from Indian medical schools between 1955 and 2002, about 80% of who were graduates of publicly funded medical colleges.
19116026:18	Over the same period, 47,527 physicians, trained in India, were registered in the AMA master-file.
19116026:19	Of these 46,083 were born outside of the United States and the United Kingdom, and taken as the "emigrants." In the GMC database, 26,655 physicians graduated from Indian medical schools during this period.
19116026:20	This yields an overall physician emigration fraction for migration to the United States and the United Kingdom of 12.6 percent between 1955 and 2002.
19116026:21	In table we report our estimates of emigration fractions for Indian physicians to the United States between 1955 and 2002, broken down by quintile ranking of the college of graduation.
19116026:22	Emigration fractions of medical graduates in the top quintile of college ranks were two to four times as high as emigration fractions for graduates from the bottom quintile ranks of colleges.
19116026:23	Individuals graduating from colleges with relatively larger post-graduate programs had higher emigration fractions for the United States than colleges with smaller post-graduate programs.
19116026:24	Table presents the results of our analysis of Indian physician migration to the United States and United Kingdom, using university rankings based on publications and student preferences.
19116026:25	These results are reported separately for the period before 1985, to take account of the reorganization of universities in India, as well as for the entire study period, from 1955 to 2002.
19116026:26	2.16% of graduates of lowest ranked university on student choice immigrated to USA compared to 8.67% graduates in the highest ranked university.
19116026:27	Similarly, 1.89% of graduates of lowest ranked university on student choice emigrated to UK compared to 5.54% graduates in the highest ranked university.
19116026:28	The number of medical graduates emigrating to USA, and UK from the lowest ranked university on number of publications per undergraduate seat was roughly half the number of medical graduates emigrating from the highest ranked universities (table ).
19116026:29	Figure depicts the combined emigration fractions to the United States and the United Kingdom by university rankings based on specialty/sub-specialty seats per undergraduate is consistent with these findings.
19116026:30	Discussion 
Our study posits that the medical education system plays a key, quantifiable role in migration of physicians.
19116026:31	In this study, we found that the quality of medical education, assessed using three criterions, was associated with migration of physicians from India.
19116026:32	Based on student preferences and publications, individuals graduating from higher-ranked medical colleges in India had higher emigration fractions vis-à-vis migration to the United States.
19116026:33	Individuals graduating from colleges with relatively larger post-graduate programs had higher emigration fractions for the United States than colleges with smaller post-graduate programs.
19116026:34	The results were similar when we assessed emigration by ranking of universities.
19116026:35	These results did not change substantially when the colleges were aggregated into universities suggesting the robustness of our results.
19116026:36	Descriptive studies from Africa suggest that a small number of institutions contribute disproportionately to the ranks of emigrant physicians in developed countries [ - ].
19116026:37	Using cross-country ecological comparisons within Africa, Arah et.
19116026:38	al found that emigration of physicians from Africa is higher from more developed countries and countries with better training infrastructure compared to less developed countries.
19116026:39	Higher quality of medical education in countries with better training infrastructure is one possible and unexplored explanation of these results.
19116026:40	Our findings indicate a challenge faced by developing countries in retaining high quality human resources for health as they try to improve the quality of health care through better medical education.
19116026:41	Better quality education, particularly interaction with specialists and sub-specialists, could promote an interest in advanced training and, thus driving physician movement abroad.
19116026:42	It is also possible that better quality institutions have a teaching and training curriculum more aligned with more developed medical facilities, thus preparing them better for working in developed countries than in their home countries.
19116026:43	There are other potential explanations of our findings.
19116026:44	They could result from the association between the quality of medical education and the resulting ability of students to pass professional exams required for practicing medicine in developed countries.
19116026:45	Prior information, informally obtained by recipient country institutions by way of interactions with students and faculty from source countries, about the quality of medical training received in different medical colleges may also influence the acceptance rate of physicians in training programs.
19116026:46	The quality of medical training received may also underpin a desire for acquiring more advanced training abroad, an important driver of physician migration.
19116026:47	In principle, alumni network connections could confound our results, although the difference in emigration fractions of graduates in different colleges is evident even in the first 10 years of their date of establishment.
19116026:48	Higher emigration fractions among graduates of higher ranked colleges could also result from the higher economic status of incoming students, with the financial capacity to study abroad.
19116026:49	It is also possible that objectively better quality students from amongst the pool of medical students are more likely to migrate without any impact of medical colleges . Nonetheless, these factors are unlikely to constitute a full explanation of our findings.
19116026:50	In particular, students who qualify to study at government-run medical colleges in India are chosen from amongst thousands of potential candidates who appear in a pre-medical examination, and thus likely to be of high quality.
19116026:51	More than 200,000 candidates took the AIPMT examination in 2007, for roughly 1,640 seats.
19116026:52	Because expenses in government medical colleges are highly subsidized, economic considerations may be less relevant for admissions at least at government medical colleges, which accounted for 80 percent of all emigrating physicians.
19116026:53	Since we lack detailed longitudinal information on individuals, we cannot disentangle individual-specific factors from institutional factors that drive international migration among Indian physicians.
19116026:54	Each medical school fulfills various missions including teaching, research, and patient care and because institutional priorities, capacity and approaches vary, ranking all schools based on a single criterion is of limited utility.
19116026:55	We avoided this pitfall by considering three different indicators covering accreditation, research activity and a proxy of faculty input.
19116026:56	Nonetheless, we could not consider other methods in evaluation medical schools such as impact on students, alumni giving and public service because of lack of data.
19116026:57	Another limitation, stemming from the indicators of quality of medical training we used, is the appropriateness of recent rankings to adequately capture past quality of education provided at these medical colleges.
19116026:58	In practice, however, the ranking of colleges and universities on the basis of the number of specialty and sub-specialty seats as well as publications are likely a "cumulative" indicator of past quality, since building infrastructure, both faculty and facilities, take time.
19116026:59	Additionally, our method of ranking colleges and universities by quintiles is unlikely to be very sensitive to small changes in individual college, or university, scores.
19116026:60	If the likelihood of physician migration is the same across training institutions, losses in human capital due to emigrating physicians can be addressed by adding to training capacity and additional private sector training institutions might emerge to meet 'physician export' needs.
19116026:61	However, as our findings indicate, because the physicians who emigrate are concentrated at higher quality institutions, losses in human capital resulting from emigration cannot be readily overcome by simply expanding private medical colleges.
19116026:62	Even though India has expanded medical education rapidly through 'privatization' and trains large number of physicians in recent decades, only a few medical schools have the necessary resources to adequately train future academic and physician leaders.
19116026:63	If the well trained group, developed at enormous public expense, is lost permanently, the resulting loss of future leadership in the health sector can adversely affect teaching, and possibly access to good quality health care both in the public and the private sector.
19116026:64	Conclusion 
To the extent that higher quality training is supported by greater public subsidies, as is the case with higher education in many developing countries, the disproportionate emigration of well-trained human capital can impose a significant financial burden on those remaining in the home country.
19116026:65	These subsidies in higher education may have allowed India to capitalize on greater global inter-linkages, and benefited migrating physicians, but in a resource-constrained environment, this migration likely implies a significant adverse impact on the quality of health service delivery.
19116026:66	In these circumstances, a strategy of linking the provision of the public subsidy to the individual medical graduate's decision to migrate is an obvious policy option worth pursuing.
19116026:67	However, financial (dis)incentives can only be one element in a mix of methods to keep highly trained individuals.
19116026:68	It may require developing country governments, at least the ones that can afford to do so (such as China and India), to set up and expand high-quality research and policy institutions to engage talented individuals.
19116026:69	And, it may also necessitate admissions strategies to public medical colleges that emphasize specific lengths of service in the home country.

20062733:0	Introduction 
Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a rare entity characterized by the dysfunction of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells, and the activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system . Its clinical symptoms include long-term high fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy.
20062733:1	HPS is divided into primary and secondary HPS, both of which are trigged by acute infections . The pathophysiology of HPS is very complex, but most researchers now believe that it involves the dysregulation of CTLs and activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS).
20062733:2	In the HPS patient phagocytosis of blood cells is a very complex process and may be related to the production of specific immunoglobulins [ - ].
20062733:3	In the current case, we found that plasma cells increased markedly in left neck lymph node during the progression of HPS.
20062733:4	This observation supports the idea that antibody responses against blood cells may play an important role in the progression of HPS.
20062733:5	Case presentation 
A 20-year-old enlisted man presented with a 1-month history of discontinuous fever, panic, and hypodynamia, and was admitted to People's Liberation Army 152 hospital in May 2008.
20062733:6	He had no other complaints.
20062733:7	The patient had previously been healthy, with no history of infectious diseases or allergies to food or drugs.
20062733:8	Physical examination showed a temperature of 37.3°C and no other remarkable signs.
20062733:9	Laboratory measurements and examinations revealed no abnormalities.
20062733:10	On admission, the patient was administered broad spectrum antibiotics and antiviral drugs.
20062733:11	However, his fever failed to resolve and his temperature rose to between 38.5°C and 40.9°C.
20062733:12	More than 2 weeks later, lymphadenopathy of the left neck, armpit, and left groin was detected by ultrasound.
20062733:13	Left groin lymph node and bone marrow puncture biopsies were performed.
20062733:14	Histopathological examination of the groin lymph node showed reactive hyperplasia and revealed one histiocyte engulfing few blood cells (Figure.
20062733:15	).
20062733:16	The bone marrow smear showed no remarkable results.
20062733:17	On admission, we cultured for bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and tested for antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), treponema pallidum, chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), mycoplasma (MP), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (Adv), however, we were unable to detect the triggering agent.
20062733:18	One month later, laboratory tests produced the following values: white blood cell count 1.60 × 10 9/L, red blood cell 3.42 × 10 12/L, hemoglobin 107 g/L, platelet count 156 × 10 9/L, fibrinogen 0.67 g/L, triglyceride 13.9 mmol/L (Table ).
20062733:19	Ultrasound examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly.
20062733:20	Left neck lymph node biopsy and bone marrow puncture smear were performed.
20062733:21	The results were characteristic of HPS (Figure. and Figure.
20062733:22	).
20062733:23	The germinal centers were unclear in both the groin and cervical lymph nodes, and the lymph nodes retained normal structure, except for sinusoidal expansion (Figure.
20062733:24	).
20062733:25	Broadening of the sinuses in the groin lymph node was mainly detected in the medullary area, where they were filled with histiocytes (Figure.
20062733:26	).
20062733:27	In the cervical lymph node, the subcapsular, peritrabecular and medullary sinuses were expanded and filled with activated histiocytes that were seen to be phagocytosing blood cells (Figure.
20062733:28	Figure ).
20062733:29	Plasma cell counts averaged 8/high power field (HPF) in the medullary cord of the groin lymph node, while they averaged 17/HPF in the cervical lymph node (Figure Figure ).
20062733:30	Treatment was administered according to the Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 2004 protocol , with proper alternation (cyclophosphamide, perarubicin, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone and etoposide), but the patient suffered multiple organ dysfunction syndrome after therapy, and died from pulmonary infection 2 month later.
20062733:31	Discussion 
HPS is a life-threatening condition characterized by the activation of the MPS.
20062733:32	It can be divided into genetic HPS and secondary HPS . Genetic HPS can result from autosomal defects, or can also be associated with immune deficiencies, such as Chediak-Higashi syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, and Griscelli syndrome.
20062733:33	Secondary HPS is associated with exogenous agents (including viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and toxins), endogenous products (including those resulting from tissue damage, metabolic products, free radical stress), rheumatic diseases, and malignant diseases [ , ].
20062733:34	In the current case, we were unable to detect the triggering agent, despite culturing for bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and testing for antibodies to HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, treponema pallidum, CP, MP, RSV, and Adv, and the patient's fever failed to resolve despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral drugs.
20062733:35	We found no association between drug use and HPS.
20062733:36	A diagnosis of lymphoma was eliminated because of the tissue structure and immunoarchitecture.
20062733:37	Although progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of HPS, the exact mechanisms responsible for the phagocytosis are unknown in HPS.
20062733:38	Researchers found out that there have the RBC antibodies in the EBV-HPS and anti-RBC antibodies were involved in the phagocytosis of RBCs by macrophages . Also several other researchers have demonstrated that virus infection can induce antibody responses against RBCs, platelets, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells . As we known the antibodies are produced by the plasma cells.
20062733:39	However there has no reports about the exactly changes of plasma cells in HPS patients.
20062733:40	In our case the number of plasma cells was markedly increased from 8/HPF in the groin lymph node to 17/HPF in the cervical lymph node during the disease progression.
20062733:41	Although we didn't detect changes of special antibodies against blood cells, this observation maybe provide a new idea for researchers to study the pathophysiology of HPS.
20062733:42	Conclusion 
This case report showed plasma cells increased markedly in the left neck node during the progression of HPS.
20062733:43	The result maybe provide one way to study the pathophysiology of the HPS.

20831828:0	Introduction 
Extensive epidemiological and toxicological research over several decades has focused on the health effects of radiation to understand the risk of exposure to both public and workforce.
20831828:1	Ionizing radiation has been used in both diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications and described as a double-edged sword .
20831828:2	However, there are considerable concerns about the detrimental health effects associated with direct radiation exposure [ - ] even on metabolically inactive cells . Radiation is harmful in terms of risks to health from accidental exposure and its role as a carcinogen , however on the other side it is beneficial for the use of various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as the treatment of cancer.
20831828:3	Radiotherapy (RT) continues to be an important therapeutic modality for the treatment of cancer.
20831828:4	RT for cancers allows killing of the cancer cells but also shows a risk for adverse consequences such as tissue atrophy and formation of secondary tumors at the same organ, or at some distanced part of body . Furthermore, radiation exposure during diagnostic (e.g. X-rays, CT-scans) and RT procedures shows varying health effects in the general population and also in cancer patients [ - ].
20831828:5	But with cancer survivors living longer, there is a growing concern regarding the risk of radiation - induced secondary cancers in patients treated with ionizing radiation.
20831828:6	The situation is important for children, who are inherently more radiosensitive and therefore at greater risk for radiation induced post-radiotherapy cancer development [ - ].
20831828:7	The DNA damage response system, which maintains the survival and genomic stability of the cell, represents a vital line of defense against various exogenous and endogenous DNA damaging agents . Radiation can induce apoptosis or trigger DNA repair mechanisms.
20831828:8	In general minor DNA damage is thought to halt cell cycle to allow effective repair, while more severe damage can induce an apoptotic cell death program.
20831828:9	Until relatively recently, the only known adverse consequences of radiation exposure to the cells were direct DNA damage.
20831828:10	Damage of DNA is central to major biological processes such as cancer, disturbances of cell function and aging . Particularly, genome stability is critical for the avoidance of cancer development.
20831828:11	In normal cells, DNA damage of a single cell most likely represents an initiating event for carcinogenesis.
20831828:12	However, the dogma that genetic and biochemical alterations are restricted only to the directly irradiated cells has been challenged by the observation that similar effects can also be seen in normal non-irradiated cells adjacent to the irradiated or targeted cells [ , - ], known as "bystander effect" (BE).
20831828:13	The consequence of this transmitted signal could be either negative or positive, depending on the specific circumstances.
20831828:14	BE results from the ability of cells directly irradiated to produce changes in normal cells nearby, which are not directly irradiated, thereby eliciting similar responses to that of the irradiated cells (Figure- ).
20831828:15	The transmission of signal(s) appears to be via secreted soluble molecules [ , ] or via gap junctions [ - ] (Figure- ).
20831828:16	Most BE studies have been carried out using various cell lines ( in vitro ), where irradiated medium is transferred to non-irradiated cell (Figure ).
20831828:17	In this review, I have summarized the current understanding of radiation induced BE, with a focus on cell communications and its implications towards genomic instability.
20831828:18	Type of radiations and bystander effect 
Biological effectiveness of radiation depends on the linear energy transfer (LET), total dose, fractionation rate and radio-sensitivity of the targeted cells or tissues . Low LET radiations (X-rays, gamma rays and beta particles), deposi s ts a relatively small quantity of energy.
20831828:19	On the other hand, high LET radiations (neutrons and alpha particles) deposits more energy on the targeted areas and caused more biological effects than the low LET radiations.
20831828:20	Although various precautions are taken during RT to limit the damage to healthy normal tissues surrounding the target site, potential injury can lead to various normal-tissue complications.
20831828:21	In addition to direct effects, bystander effects also show dependency on the type of radiation and appear to be cell type and genotype specific .
20831828:22	This suggests a need to understand the mechanism(s) for radiation induced bystander effects.
20831828:23	The direct and indirect (bystander) radiation effects are mechanistically different.
20831828:24	It has been shown that the intensity of damage and radiation injury varies according to the specific cell type and its susceptibility to the radiation injury.
20831828:25	For example, radiotherapy of pelvic cancer is frequently associated with the early and late intestinal and rectal toxicity . Both low and high LET radiations have been shown to induce BE [ , - ].
20831828:26	However, it is not clear whether the BE is confined to both type of radiation exposure of various systems at different end points studied.
20831828:27	Studies on the BE carried out falls into two main approaches: 1.
20831828:28	Use of low and high LET radiations (whole cells irradiated); 2.
20831828:29	Targeting the cellular organelles using an advanced microbeam radiation facilities, this is available only in few countries.
20831828:30	In the whole cell irradiation experiments either after low or high LET radiations, transferring irradiated conditioned medium (ICM) from the irradiated cells to the non-irradiated bystander cells were used.
20831828:31	Many signal molecules remain bound to the surface of the irradiated cell and influence only cells that contact it, or these signals can be soluble in its environment, which can be carried far from the irradiated cells.
20831828:32	Contact-dependent signaling is important only in nearby cells or within organs.
20831828:33	In most cases, paracrine or endocrine signaling molecules are carrying the secreted stimuli by the irradiated cells to act as a local or far a field.
20831828:34	The signaling molecules can be gases, proteins or hormones.
20831828:35	For example nitric oxide (NO), a gas and part of a locally based signaling system is able to lower human's blood pressure is indicated in the radiation induced bystander responses [ , ].
20831828:36	Thus, the mechanical injury caused by a direct irradiation can activate various chemical stimuli and communicate to nearby or far located cells that have not been directly influenced by irradiation.
20831828:37	Molecules secreted in response to radiation may also be carried far from the secreted cells to the distant targets, or they may act as local mediators only affecting cells in the immediate environment of the signaling cell (Figure- ).
20831828:38	Another way to coordinate the activities of neighboring cells is through gap junctions.
20831828:39	Cell-cell junctions can form through the plasma membranes closely adjacent cells, connecting their cytoplasm.
20831828:40	This type of communication system operates on a local level.
20831828:41	Although gap junction communication and the presence of soluble mediator(s) are both known to play an important role in bystander response, the precise signaling molecules have yet to be identified.
20831828:42	What is not fully understood at this juncture is how the damaged cell passes its damage signals to the normal cells located at far distance.
20831828:43	One possible mechanism is via hormones.
20831828:44	Hormones are long-distanced signaling molecules that must be transported via the circulatory system from their production site to their target cells and may be involved in the radiation induced bystander response for transmitting the signals to the far distanced organs.
20831828:45	Another agent can be Ca2 + signaling molecule implicated in the BE . 
Implications of DNA damage 
BE can be mediated through an increase in chromosomal anomalies, genomic instability, changes in proteins expression, mutations and further by malignant transformation.
20831828:46	However, the mechanisms of BE are not yet clear and little is known about the type of DNA damage of the bystander cells, its contributories to tumorigenesis and how this damage can be repaired to design a novel therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment.
20831828:47	Ionizing radiation induced DNA damage in a single cell  is central to major biological process, such as cancer.
20831828:48	However, this classical paradigm has been modified and shown that irradiated cells can also elicit increased level of mutations and chromosomal aberrations in neighboring cells that have never been exposed to radiation.
20831828:49	Using high LET radiations (alpha particles), Nagasawa and Little  first showed sister chromatid exchange s in the non-irradiated cells.
20831828:50	BE on the DNA using high LET radiation was further confirmed by Azzam et al  who found connexin mediated gap junction transfer of signals involved in this process.
20831828:51	Later, Daspande et al  suggested NADPH mediated mechanisms are also involved.
20831828:52	Lyng et al  reported, using human keratinocytes when the medium from irradiated cells (0.5 or 5 Gy) was transferred to non-irradiated cells, an increase in calcium fluxes (within 30 s), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (after 6 h of medium transfer).
20831828:53	This study suggested that the initiating events in the cascade that leads to apoptosis induction in non-irradiated cells are by signals produced from the irradiated cells.
20831828:54	Further, it has been shown that in very low doses (1 cGy-5 Gy) of 60Co gamma radiation, increased cell death by apoptosis, necrosis and further reduced cell cloning efficiency in the cells that were never exposed to radiation . 
A delayed genomic instability was observed in the RKO (human colorectal carcinoma cells) after 5Gy of X-rays.
20831828:55	Growth medium conditioned by unstable RKO derivatives induced genomic instability suggesting that these cells can secrete factors that produce bystander responses in the unirradiated cells . Konopaka and Wolny  tested the bystander effect in human leukemic K562 cells of chronic myeloid leukemia using the medium transfer method.
20831828:56	They compared the effects of antioxidant vitamin C and E on the frequency of micronuclei and apoptotic cells in both directly irradiated and also in the bystander cells.
20831828:57	Adding vitamin C or E to cell culture reduced the frequency of micronucleated cells in the bystander cells, indicating that these vitamins may reduce the efficacy (cell killing) of radiotherapy.
20831828:58	Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), which plays a major role in radiation induced fibroblast differentiation and glioma cell survival, also has been found to be involved in bystander response signaling [ , ].
20831828:59	Using high LET radiations, Lehnert and Goodwin  has also been found that alpha particles caused increase in sister chromatid exchange, an indicator of DNA damage in bystander cells.
20831828:60	Cells exposed to the high LET radiations showed DNA double strand breaks , point mutations  and multiple DNA double strand breaks in bystander cells . Suzuki et al  showed that the altered chromatin organization induced by deletion might be transmitted as DNA damage memory in the following progeny of the bystander cells.
20831828:61	Further, Lyng et al  reported that microbeam irradiation of keratinocyte (HPU-G) induced an increase in ROS, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased expression of Bcl2 and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm with an increase in apoptotic cell death.
20831828:62	Irradiation of a single human fibroblast with a single 4HE2+ particle demonstrated a 2 to 3 fold increase in micronucleated and apoptotic death in the adjacent non-irradiated cells . Belyakov et al  studied micronuclei and apoptotic effects in porcine and human urothelial explants and suggested that the bystander-induced damage depends on the proliferation status of the cells when irradiated to 3He2+ ions.
20831828:63	Very recently, cells irradiated by low-dose alpha-particles (1-10 cGy) in a mixed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell system showed micronuclei and double strand breaks in the bystander cell population . 
Implications of Cell proliferation 
The most commonly reported BE after exposure to radiation is a decrease in cell survival an effect similar to that caused by direct irradiation.
20831828:64	However, a very few recent studies reported increases in bystander cell proliferation compared with their directly irradiated counterparts.
20831828:65	Increases in bystander cell proliferation may show more adverse effects than the decrease in cell proliferation.
20831828:66	Iyer et al  have demonstrated that when non-irradiated rat liver epithelial cells (WB-F344) were co-cultured with γ-rays irradiated (0.5 to 20 Gy) cells, proliferation was more rapid in the co-cultured cells compared to the control cell populations.
20831828:67	However, when both non-irradiated and irradiated cells were seeded sparsely in such a way to avoid contact with each other, no change in the proliferation rate was observed.
20831828:68	Conversely, increased proliferation rate in bystander cells was observed when both non-irradiated and irradiated cells were seeded in high density . The authors have concluded that a direct cell-to-cell contact is much more important for increased proliferation observed in bystander cells than either gap junctions or soluble factors.
20831828:69	Mothersill et al  also showed an increase in clonogenic survival when medium was irradiated (0.5 Gy, γ-rays) and transferred from the mismatch repair deficient (Raji 10) cells to the mismatch repair proficient (Raji TK -) cells.
20831828:70	Furthermore, Baskar et al  reported that when using low (gamma) or high (alpha) LET radiations, an increase in bystander cell survival (proliferation) occurs.
20831828:71	However, the magnitude of stimulation in bystander normal (GM637H) fibroblast cells was different when another normal human lung fibroblast (MRC-5) and immortalized ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) defective (GM5849C) fibroblasts were used for low and high LET radiations.
20831828:72	The novel finding of this study was that at the same cellular conditions, both low and high LET radiation increased the clonogenic potential (cell proliferation capacity) of recipient cells.
20831828:73	Medium from the ATM defective (GM5849C) cells after γ-irradiation showed less stimulating effect than medium from normal (MRC-5) cells.
20831828:74	However, after α- irradiation an inverse effect was reported.
20831828:75	This may be due to different signals being released in the medium by low and high LET radiations . 
Interestingly in the bystander cells, increased clonogenic stimulation can be alleviated by dilution of the irradiated conditioned medium . It thus becomes clear that the sources of stimulating properties in the culture medium are soluble factors that have been released from the irradiated cells.
20831828:76	In a recent study Han et al  reported an increase in bystander cell growth when co-cultured with cells irradiated by low-dose α-particles (1-10 cGy).
20831828:77	Subsequently, further studies indicated that nitric oxide (NO) and transforming growth factor -1 (TGF-1) played a role in this increase in cell proliferation .
20831828:78	The increased nature of cell proliferation with the decrease in cell division time is highly suggestive that the bystander rapid cell proliferation might be carcinogenic.
20831828:79	Molecular signals involved in the BE 
The response of cells to ionizing radiation is complex, involving the activation of a cascade of multiple signal transduction pathways.
20831828:80	Cellular responses to physiological and environmental stimuli are mediated by specific signaling cascade that can affect cellular growth, differentiation and cell survival.
20831828:81	Activation of protein kinase-C (PKC) family is one of the important and earliest events in a cellular cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses such as cell proliferation and differentiation.
20831828:82	It is also an important regulator of radiation-induced apoptosis [ , ].
20831828:83	In a recent study, ICM collected from normal human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) 1 h after 1 Gy, or 10 Gy of γ-irradiation, bystander cells showed an increase in intracellular distribution of PKC isoforms (PKC-βII, PKC-α/β, PKC-θ) in total and subcellular (cytosolic and nuclear) fractions . In an earlier study it has been reported that the medium collected from the cells exposed to either low or high LET radiations increased the bystander cell survival . These studies indicate that the molecules released in the ICM, which further activates the PKC may act as a growth stimulatory effect to the bystander cells.
20831828:84	The specific sub-cellular activation of PKC isoforms in bystander cells, demonstrated for the first time by Baskar et al , may help to identify the effect of therapeutically used radiation exposure for tumor destructions along with its implications for adjacent non-irradiated cells and organs.
20831828:85	However, the nature of the PKC isoforms signaling response that determines cell survival or death is far from completely understood.
20831828:86	Further, Hu et al  reported PKCε function both as an anti and pro-apoptotic protein and it is the only PKC isozyme implicated in oncogenesis via radiation induced bystander effects.
20831828:87	In this respect, the elevated expression of PKC isoforms PKC-βII, PKC-α/β, PKC-θ and PKCε induced in the bystander cells deserves special attention . Interestingly, PKC promotes cell survival in response to ionizing radiation in a variety of experimental models including human carcinoma, glioblastoma, and transformed mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines .
20831828:88	Inhibition of PKC leads to increased sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation and suggest its importance in cellular response to radiation .
20831828:89	However, understanding the biological functions of individual PKC isoforms and the cellular pathways in which they participate in radiation induced bystander effect remains mostly unknown.
20831828:90	Recently, Burdak-Rothkamm et al  demonstrated a decrease in clonogenic survival in ATM/ATR/DNA-PK proficient non-irradiated bystander cells, but this effect was completely abrogated in ATR and ATM but not DNA-PK deficient bystander cells.
20831828:91	This, indicate that the ATM activation in bystander cells is dependent on ATR function.
20831828:92	Furthermore, bystander cells over express Cox-2 gene , a downstream target of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways involved in radiation responses and linked to bystander processes .
20831828:93	It is likely that some common initiating or intermediate steps are involved in bystander cellular activation of PKC and Cox-2 in response to radiation.
20831828:94	Activation of PKC as a negative regulator of radiation-induced apoptosis might act as a positive regulator for cell proliferation.
20831828:95	While the radiation induced mechanisms are not fully established, it can be postulated that the intercellular signaling molecules originating from directly irradiated cells could play a major role in transferring the damage signals to bystander cells.
20831828:96	Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo (animal studies) 
Recently, research has been focused on bystander effects using animal models.
20831828:97	It is known for several years that the direct radiation exposure effects are sex-specific . Recently, Koturbash et al  reported different levels of DNA damage in bystander spleen tissue between male and female mice demonstrating for the first time that the males are more sensitive.
20831828:98	Interestingly, significant sex differences in the levels of methylation in spleen tissue were eliminated when the mice were subjected to gonadoectomy.
20831828:99	Although this study did not find significant sex differences in the levels of death in bystander cells of the spleen (with a non-significant increase in apoptosis in females), it suggested a role of sex hormones interrelationship between bystander effects and secondary radiation-induced malignancies in males and females.
20831828:100	Further, Koturbash et al  reported an existence of somatic bystander effects in vivo using rodent skin and spleen models, whereby one part of the animal body was exposed to radiation while a medical-grade shield protected another part.
20831828:101	X-ray exposure of one side of the animal body caused profound epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, histone modification and RNA-associated silencing) in the unexposed bystander parts of the animal.
20831828:102	It was noted that the DNA double-strand breaks and apoptotic cell death were induced in bystander mouse cerebellum.
20831828:103	Accompanying these genetic events, bystander-related tumor induction in the cerebellum of radiosensitive Patched-1 (Ptch1) heterozygous mice after x-ray exposure of the remainder of body, further suggested a mechanism mediated by gap-junctional intercellular communication for transmission of bystander damage to shielded cerebellum.
20831828:104	These findings are the first to demonstrate that the bystander radiation responses can initiate tumorigenesis in unexposed tissues in vivo . Lorimore et al  showed that macrophages obtained from the bone marrow of irradiated CBA/ca mice induced chromosomal instability as assessed by nonclonal cytogenetic aberrations in the clonal descendants of non-irradiated stem cells.
20831828:105	However, similar bystander effects are not found in C57BL/6 mice.
20831828:106	This study showed a genotype dependent higher incidence of chromosomal instability as a radiation-induced bystander effect in mice.
20831828:107	Further Coates et al  reported CBA/ca mice are more sensitive to bone marrow macrophage damage than the C57BL/6 mice.
20831828:108	Ilnytskyy et al  reported that in mice ionizing radiation induced distinct DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin of animals subjected to single-dose (acute) or fractionated whole-body or cranial (head) exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays.
20831828:109	Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen at 6, 96 h and 14 days after irradiation.
20831828:110	However, fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen at 6 h after whole body irradiation and 6, 96 h and 14 days after cranial irradiation.
20831828:111	Contrarily, changes were seen only 6 h after acute whole body and cranial head irradiation.
20831828:112	This study showed that the ionizing radiation induced epigenetic bystander effects triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure can occur in the same organism and are very distinct in different bystander organs.
20831828:113	Interestingly these data suggest that the observed in vivo results on the radiation induced genomic instability on bystander responses would be of relevance for human health.
20831828:114	Clearly, more animal studies will give a concrete evidence of this existing radiation induced bystander phenomenon.
20831828:115	Conclusions 
Radiation induced bystander effect increases the probability/extent of cellular response to radiation and therefore has important implications for cancer risk assessment following low and high doses of low or high LET radiations, and for the possible formation of secondary cancers after radiation exposure.
20831828:116	During the past decade there have been major advances in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and biological significance of BE.
20831828:117	The situation is important among non-elderly adults, whom the long- term risks of radiation exposure induced BE are more relevant.
20831828:118	Particularly, children are inherently more radiosensitive, and further children have more remaining years of life during which a late radiation induced bystander cell could develop cancer.
20831828:119	However, the general dogma that only direct radiation causes the genomic instability is challenged by the existence of the recent findings of the BE.
20831828:120	Limiting the radiation induced genomic damage of normal cells, which may further lead to cancer formation is key in the field of radiation protection.
20831828:121	There is no longer any single normal cell showing mutations or being at risk from the radiation.
20831828:122	Instead, the risk can also been carried by bystander cells which may be located adjacent or far from the directly irradiated cells/organs.
20831828:123	Furthermore, radiation induced bystander cells are at risk for late genomic instability, which is associated with many cancers.
20831828:124	The major challenge in the field is to understand the various molecular mechanisms involved in non-targeted effects and therefore counteract those factors, preventing the signaling and thereafter carcinogenesis process.
20831828:125	Most encouragingly, the identification of critical molecules that act as the main 'switches' for sending the signals from the irradiated cells/tissues to the non-irradiated cells/tissues should provide a rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

19946394:0	Methods 
Results 
The study started in July 2000 and was completed in July 2005.
19946394:1	The flow of the subjects during the study is shown in . All 56 subjects completed the study.
19946394:2	Twenty-one subjects received the penetrating needle first, and 35 received the non-penetrating (placebo) needle first.
19946394:3	Both the groups fitted a probability of 0.5 (χ 2 = 3.5, p = 0.06).
19946394:4	Interpretation 
In this double-blind study, we found that the analgesic effect from the skin penetration and deep needle insertion (a distinctive feature of acupuncture) with the penetrating needle was no greater than the analgesic effect from the skin pressure alone with the non-penetrating needle.
19946394:5	The analgesic effect produced by the penetrating needle was relatively weak and less persistent compared with previous studies that were performed without effective double-blind controls.
19946394:6	Furthermore, we found no significant correlation between the analgesic effect and de qi which has been considered essential for acupuncture analgesia.
19946394:7	Our study has several limitations.
19946394:8	First, the analgesia produced by skin pressure with the non-penetrating needles, which may stimulate high-threshold skin mechanoreceptors, may mimic the analgesic effect experienced in acupressure treatments.
19946394:9	Further research using appropriate controls is required for addressing this issue.
19946394:10	Second, in practice, additional manipulations or adjustments to the insertion depth and direction of the needle are performed after penetration to achieve de qi with each needle application.
19946394:11	In our study, the needles were designed to provide uniform direction and depth of needle insertion in all subjects.
19946394:12	In addition, we did not conduct additional manipulation after needle insertion.
19946394:13	Therefore, all of the subjects received the same stimulus to allow comparison of the effects of needle application.
19946394:14	We believe a change in stimulus would likely have changed our outcomes of interest.
19946394:15	However, the pain intensity among subjects who perceived de qi with penetrating and non-penetrating needles was not less than the pain intensity among those who did not perceive de qi . As such, it is possible that de qi is not a precondition of subsequent acupuncture analgesia.
19946394:16	Third, we selected a crossover design because of resource constraints.
19946394:17	As reported previously, crossover designs have often shown greater statistical power than parallel-group designs with large samples.
19946394:18	In our case, although our sample was relatively small, it was sufficient to apply the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test to reveal a significant difference in analgesic effect between the penetrating and non-penetrating needles.
19946394:19	Although the small sample was a potential limitation, the differences obtained between the two types of needles would be sufficiently small to be considered clinically significant.
19946394:20	Fourth, there may have been a carry-over analgesic effect of the treatment.
19946394:21	To prevent a carry-over effect, we designed the study so that there would be an interval of at least 24 hours between the two needle trials.
19946394:22	This interval was determined based on findings from previous studies, where alleviation of experimental pain with acupuncture at the LI-4 point was maintained for about 1 hour after needle removal with manual acupuncture and for up to 16 hours after needle removal with electrical acupuncture.
19946394:23	In our study, significant alleviation of pain was observed only until 20 minutes after needle removal.
19946394:24	We observed no significant difference in pain intensity between the group who received the penetrating needle first and the group who received the non-penetrating needle first; therefore, we believe the results were not biased by the carry-over or order effect.
19946394:25	We believe that our method of blinding practitioners using validated double-blind needles , was successful and that the subjects were unaware of the use of non-penetrating blunt-tipped needles as in previous studies.
19946394:26	- - However, the successful blinding of subjects should be interpreted with caution: the subjects were not specifically asked whether they believed they had received a penetrating or a non-penetrating needle.
19946394:27	Despite these limitations, our results support the use of double-blind methodology in future acupuncture research.
19946394:28	Large randomized controlled double-blind trials involving different types of pain (e.g., secondary pain after excessive tonic muscle tension) in which patients are informed of the possible use of non-penetrating needles are necessary.
19946394:29	Also, further studies are required to determine the relation between analgesia and de qi elicited after needle insertion.
18700961:0	Background 
Acute chest pain is responsible for approximately 700,000 patient attendances per year at emergency departments in England and Wales and 20–30% of emergency medical admissions . The Chest Pain Unit (CPU) has been developed to improve care and reduce costs for patients with acute chest pain.
18700961:1	A single centre study  has shown that CPUs care can reduce admissions, reattendances and outpatient follow-up, and improve quality of life for selected low-risk patients who are suitable for CPU care.
18700961:2	The ESCAPE (Effectiveness and Safety of Chest pain Assessment to Prevent Emergency admissions) multicentre trial was undertaken to determine whether CPU could reduce admissions, improve outcomes and be cost effective across a variety of NHS hospitals.
18700961:3	The main analysis from the ESCAPE multicentre trial  showed that the introduction of CPU care across a range of hospitals: 1) Did not alter the proportion of patients admitted, 2) Was associated with increased reattendances and subsequent admissions and 3) May have been associated with increased numbers of patients attending with chest pain.
18700961:4	It concluded that establishing CPU care throughout the NHS could not be justified on the basis of any expectation of reducing emergency admissions.
18700961:5	Even if CPU care does not reduce hospital admissions it may still be cost-effective, compared to routine care, if it improves patient outcomes or reduces health service costs in other ways, such as by reducing length of hospital stay.
18700961:6	We therefore planned to undertake an economic evaluation alongside the ESCAPE multicentre trial , using data from the trial and from external sources in a decision-analytic model (the rationale for using this type of model is explained in a later section).
18700961:7	Our specific objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CPU, compared to routine care, in terms of the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
18700961:8	This outcome measure allows us to combine length of life and quality of life into a single summary measure and thus allows a multidimensional comparison of CPU care with routine care.
18700961:9	Methods 
We developed a decision-analytic model to estimate the costs and QALYs accrued by patients with chest pain who received CPU or routine care.
18700961:10	We assumed that CPU care could potentially influence QALYs in three ways: 1) Reducing the time delay to reperfusion for ST-elevation myocardial infarction; 2) Reducing the proportion of patients inadvertently discharged home with acute coronary syndrome; and 3) Reducing diagnostic uncertainty and thus improving quality of life.
18700961:11	Results 
The values used to populate the economic model were: 
1.
18700961:12	The proportion of chest pain patients who had ST-elevation myocardial infarction varied across the trial hospitals from 1.6 to 7.8% with an overall mean value of 3.6% (95% CI 3.5 to 3.7).
18700961:13	2.
18700961:14	Mean expected mortality among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction was 10.03% (95% CI 9.96 to 10.10) among patients who attended when no CPU was available.
18700961:15	3.
18700961:16	The estimated effect of CPU availability upon expected mortality from ST-elevation myocardial infarction was a non-significant increase of 0.07% (95% CI -0.18 to 0.33).
18700961:17	4.
18700961:18	The proportion of chest pain patients subsequently discharged with ACS at a hospital with no CPU was estimated to be 1.2% (95% CI 0.6 to 2.3) . 
5.
18700961:19	The odds ratio for the adjusted effect of CPU care upon the proportion of patients who were discharged and then subsequently admitted was 1.26 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.72; p = 0.146), giving a relative risk of 1.256 (95% CI 0.921 to 1.705).
18700961:20	6.
18700961:21	The effect of inadvertent discharge upon mortality from ACS, compared to admission was estimated to be a 3% absolute increase using data from a literature review outlined in our previous model . 
7.
18700961:22	The mean area under the curve for health utility up to six months after attending a hospital with no CPU available was estimated to be 0.318 QALYs (95% CI 0.311 to 0.326) using trial data from patients attending CPU hospitals before intervention and attending a control hospital at any time.
18700961:23	8.
18700961:24	The estimated effect of CPU upon mean area under the curve for health utility up to six months was a non-significant improvement of 0.0084 (95% CI -0.0168 to 0.0337; p = 0.512).
18700961:25	9.
18700961:26	Discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (after the initial six months) for patients with coronary heart disease was estimated to be 6.83 QALYs . 
Costs per patient up to six months ranged from zero to £28,248, with a mean of £2385 and a median of £1566.
18700961:27	Mean cost per patient was £2468 before and £2326 after intervention at the CPU hospitals, and was £2417 before and £2330 after intervention at the control hospitals.
18700961:28	The mean cost per patient for all patients who attended a hospital with no CPU (i.e. all patients at control hospitals and pre-intervention patients at CPU hospitals) was £2405 (95% CI 2280 to 2529).
18700961:29	The introduction of CPU care was associated with a non-significant £31 per patient reduction in 6-month costs (95% CI -400 to 461, p = 0.889).
18700961:30	Discussion 
We found that on average CPU care would result in a cost saving compared to routine care, although this was not a statistically significant result.
18700961:31	The probability that CPU care is cost effective is approximately 70% at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY.
18700961:32	This finding, however, is subject to uncertainty and it is necessary to bear in mind the substantial investment that would be needed to provide CPU care throughout the NHS.
18700961:33	On the basis of this analysis we cannot justify widespread implementation of CPU care throughout the NHS.
18700961:34	Most previous cost-effectiveness analyses of CPU care originate from the United States (Roberts, Farkouh, Gomez [ - ]).
18700961:35	These studies were based on randomised trials comparing CPU care to inpatient care that primarily compared resource use and did not evaluate patient-centred outcomes.
18700961:36	They showed that CPU care was cheaper than routine care, but it is not clear whether this finding can be extrapolated outside the United States.
18700961:37	It is also only relevant if CPU care replaces inpatient care.
18700961:38	Although practice in the UK has changed recently, with increasing use of percutaneous coronary intervention, the findings of the ESCAPE trial  suggest that many patients with chest pain still do not receive inpatient care.
18700961:39	One previous cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK, based on a single-centre randomised trial , showed a significant improvement in QALYs and a non-significant reduction in costs among selected low risk patients who were deemed suitable for CPU care.
18700961:40	These findings were not fully reproduced in the ESCAPE trial.
18700961:41	Both the QALY gain and cost reduction associated with CPU care were smaller than in the single-centre trial and were non-significant.
18700961:42	This is presumably because the ESCAPE multicentre trial evaluated the effect of CPU care across all patients with chest pain, rather than selected low-risk patients.
18700961:43	The effect of CPU care may therefore have been lost amongst the overall population with chest pain or balanced by negative effects from implementing CPU care upon patients who attended CPU hospitals with chest pain but did not receive CPU care.
18700961:44	This economic analysis has an important limitation that needs to be taken into account in interpreting the findings.
18700961:45	The comparison of the costs and effects of CPU versus routine care is made on a per patient basis, which assumes that CPU and routine care will be applied to the same population of patients attending hospital.
18700961:46	In other words, it assumes that the decision to implement CPU care or continue with routine care does not influence the size or characteristics of the population requiring the services.
18700961:47	However, it has been reported elsewhere  that the implementation of CPU care may be associated with increased attendances with chest pain and increased medical admissions.
18700961:48	If introducing CPU care leads to increased attendances with chest pain then the assumptions in this analysis will not hold.
18700961:49	Furthermore, whereas it is clear that additional attendances will incur health service costs, we do not have any evidence that they will gain benefit from their attendance.
18700961:50	Thus evidence, which cannot be incorporated in the economic model, leads us to believe that introducing CPU care may increase health service costs without any corresponding evidence that it will improve outcomes.
18700961:51	In these circumstances it is difficult to claim that CPU is likely to be cost-effective, especially considering the substantial uncertainty surrounding the results on the economic analysis.
18700961:52	Another limitation is that there was considerable variation in outcomes between the individual hospitals involved in the ESCAPE trial and in the effect of introducing CPU care at individual CPU hospitals.
18700961:53	We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that individual CPUs can markedly reduce costs and improve outcomes.
18700961:54	Indeed, the previous single centre study  showed that an active CPU can improve outcomes and possibly reduce costs among selected patients.
18700961:55	However, we can reasonably conclude that widespread implementation of CPU care is unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of health service resources.
18700961:56	We recently surveyed the development of chest pain services in the UK  and found that formal development of CPU care was limited and mostly restricted to within trials, although there was substantial informal and ad hoc development of acute chest pain services.
18700961:57	The findings of our analysis and the ESCAPE multi-centre trial suggest that this progress is probably appropriate and that investment in formal development of CPU care throughout the UK would be misplaced.
18700961:58	Conclusion 
We found that introducing CPU care had no statistically significant effect on either costs or outcomes compared to routine care.
18700961:59	Our findings are highlighted by the fact that the predicted estimates fall in all four quadrants of the cost effectiveness plane.
18700961:60	These results do not support the widespread implementation of CPU care.

19641599:0	CASE PRESENTATION 
The patient was a 12-year-old girl with left-sided obstetrical brachial plexus injury.
19641599:1	Her injury was surgically treated at a different institution 5 years before triangle tilt surgery.
19641599:2	The previous surgery included the release of subscapularis muscle, pectoralis major fractional lengthening, latissimus to infraspinatus tendon transfer, teres major to supraspinatus tendon transfer, and coracoacromial ligament release; there was only marginal improvement in function and no improvement in deformity following these procedures.
19641599:3	Physical examination revealed medial rotation contracture of the shoulder with apparently unrecognized SHEAR deformity (grade 4).
19641599:4	She could not supinate and had a flaring trumpet sign during hand-to-mouth movements.
19641599:5	Computerized tomographic scanning revealed the extent of posterior humeral head subluxation (‐11% humeral head anterior to the scapular line, and a negative value indicates dislocation), glenoid retroversion (‐53° from perpendicular to the scapular line), and glenohumeral joint dysplasia (Fig ).
19641599:6	Triangle tilt surgery was performed on the patient.
19641599:7	The procedure began with an incision along the medial edge of the superomedial border of the scapula.
19641599:8	Soft tissue was dissected from the scapula and the prominent superomedial angle of the scapula was excised with a bone cutter to create a rounded surface.
19641599:9	An incision was made over the spine of the scapula and soft tissue dissection exposed the scapular spine, which was cut with an electric saw.
19641599:10	The scapula and the acromion process derotated after osteotomy, indicating preoperative twisting and internal rotation caused by the elevated scapula.
19641599:11	The bone removed during osteotomy was morselized and placed in the bone defect between the scapular spine and the acromion process.
19641599:12	An incision was made over the distal third of the clavicle and the soft tissue was dissected to expose the clavicle.
19641599:13	Osteotomy of the clavicle was performed with an electric saw and the distal and proximal clavicle segments were fastened together in semirigid fixation with titanium screws and absorbable suture.
19641599:14	The clavicle segments were noted to “twist” relative to each other after the osteotomy, indicating torsion in the clavicle due to scapular elevation.
19641599:15	An incision was then made above the posterior glenohumeral joint and careful dissection through the deltoid muscle exposed the posterior glenohumeral capsule.
19641599:16	Laxity in the capsule was removed with a circumferential suture in a purse-string fashion.
19641599:17	Wounds were closed in multiple layers and the patient was splinted in adduction and supination, with the humerus externally rotated and in a neutral position.
19641599:18	The patient was splinted for 6 weeks and then splinted only at night for additional 3 months.
19641599:19	Physical therapy was prescribed for 6 months.
19641599:20	There was functional improvement 25 months after surgery (Fig ).
19641599:21	A postoperative computerized tomographic scan taken 25 months after surgery showed an improvement in humeral head subluxation (from ‐11% to 34%), a reduction in glenoid retroversion (from ‐53° to ‐22°), and an improvement in glenohumeral joint dysplasia (Fig ).
19641599:22	The patient's total Mallet score for shoulder function improved from 14 to 20 (of 25); external rotation and hand-to-nose and hand-to-mouth movements each improved 2 points (of 5).
19641599:23	Abduction was maximized by the muscle transfer surgery 5 years previously and was thus unchanged.
19641599:24	DISCUSSION 
A major treatment goal in children with obstetric brachial plexus injury is to obtain optimal range of shoulder motion through improved glenohumeral alignment.
19641599:25	Shoulder deformities are very common in this patient population and these developmental abnormalities lead to poor function, pain and loss of quality of life beginning as soon as the teen years.
19641599:26	Therefore, establishing glenohumeral congruency is a fundamental goal of most brachial plexus functional restorations.
19641599:27	Repositioning of the glenohumeral joint to maximize alignment does not only improve function and growth, but has been shown to encourage joint remodeling.
19641599:28	Muscle releases and tendon transfers may arrest progressive glenohumeral dysplasia and possibly influence some of the long-term effects of joint misalignment and muscle imbalance in younger patients.
19641599:29	, In older patients, these approaches remain unsatisfactory and most surgeons prefer not to treat these patients.
19641599:30	Humeral osteotomy sometimes provides functional improvements – ; however, it only moderately improves medial rotation contractures in mild to moderate cases and does not improve severe cases.
19641599:31	Additionally, humeral osteotomy does not address the glenohumeral deformity, which is the major cause of morbidity in this patient population.
19641599:32	The triangle tilt procedure provides functional improvements by directly addressing the glenohumeral deformity, and results in functional improvement as well as future remodeling of the joint.
19641599:33	During surgery, the distal acromioclavicular triangle returns to a more physiological position when osteotomies of the clavicle and acromion are performed, suggesting that the abnormal bony structures in the shoulder are under significant biomechanical stresses.
19641599:34	The plane of the acromioclavicular triangle is “tilted” toward the neutral position, and the humeral head, being related to the distal structures, moves into a more normal position.
19641599:35	Thus, glenohumeral alignment is largely restored and remodeling can begin.
19641599:36	The triangle tilt procedure has been previously shown as an effective treatment option for children and can be used for adolescents without modification.
19641599:37	The procedure can theoretically be applied to patients between the ages of 8 months and 16 years.
19641599:38	Triangle tilt is ideally suited for patients who have developed a medial rotation contracture and scapular elevation; if these abnormalities are observed, the surgery is effective in the presence of mild, moderate and severe neurological defects, including complete glenohumeral dislocations and as salvage for failed previous reconstructive surgeries.
19641599:39	A nonunion of the clavicle could potentially occur if the clavicle segments do not heal.
19641599:40	A complete separation of the acromion process from the clavicle is crucial for success.
19641599:41	It is also necessary to splint the patient as described, with adduction in the scapular line, external rotation in the humerus, and supination.
19641599:42	CONCLUSIONS 
The treatment of humeral head subluxation secondary to obstetric brachial plexus injury represents a challenge in older pediatric patients.
19641599:43	Triangle tilt surgery is effective in the treatment of older pediatric patients because it directly addresses the bony deformations that occur during childhood.
19641599:44	The 12 year old patient in this study showed noticeable clinical improvements, an improvement in glenohumeral joint dysplasia, and a reduction in humeral head subluxation 2 years after triangle tilt surgery.
19641599:45	This observation has provided valuable information and is, to our knowledge, the first documented improvement of a glenohumeral joint deformity in an older pediatric patient.
19641599:46	Future studies will be needed to determine the long-term success of triangle tilt surgery in this age group.

21756327:0	Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death worldwide.
21756327:1	Myocardial infarction (MI) often leads to heart failure (HF), which makes MI a leading source of morbidity and hospitalizations . Different inflammation biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic applications have been deployed in the clinical setting . Post-MI cell death triggers the activation of several complex inflammatory processes to clear dead cells and initiate heart tissue regeneration [ - ].
21756327:2	It has been suggested that such a coordinated regulation is fundamental to enable cardiac repair and recovery after MI . C-reactive protein (CRP) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are widely-applied biomarkers in the routine clinical setting [ , ].
21756327:3	For example, CRP's capacity to identify patients with high risk of developing HF has been demonstrated in different studies, including the Framingham Heart Study , though this can be achieved at the expense of low specificity . 
Notwithstanding the widely-accepted application of different prognostic biomarkers after MI, including indicators of inflammation, there is a need to provide new insights into the complex mechanisms leading to HF.
21756327:4	In addition, currently there is no single biomarker capable to accurately classify patients on the basis of their post-MI outcome . Standard research approaches have been based on the analysis of differential expression of putative biomarkers, using gene or protein expression values [ , ].
21756327:5	The need to provide mechanistic understanding at a systems level, while improving the predictive ability of candidate biomarkers, makes network-based approaches a pertinent new research direction in this clinical area.
21756327:6	This strategy not only entails the representation and analysis of networks of putative biomarkers, but also benefits from the integration of multiple sources of omic information.
21756327:7	The application of systems-driven approaches to discovering prognostic biomarkers and understanding disease biology has received relatively more attention in the areas of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [ - ].
21756327:8	We have previously demonstrated its potential to guide new knowledge discovery in translational research of MI [ - ].
21756327:9	For instance, we have established quantitative connections between network topological features, modularity and prognostic outcome in post-MI .
21756327:10	Moreover, we have explored the prognostic value of new biomarkers relevant to angiogenesis and cardiac repair .
21756327:11	Based on these outcomes and the lack of systems biology research of inflammation in the specific context of MI, we set out to investigate a comprehensive set of inflammation-implicated protein interactions and its potential prognostic value post-MI.
21756327:12	The main focus of this investigation was to predict clinical outcome after MI, in particular left ventricular dysfunction.

Discussion 
Conclusion 
In this research, we demonstrated how an integrative, network-driven strategy can improve systems-level mechanistic understanding of inflammation in MI.
21756327:14	We also showed the translation of network-derived information into new knowledge with potential applications to assess prognostic outcome after MI.
21756327:15	In particular, we reported new prognostic associations involving three genes: TRAF2, SHKBP1 and UBC.
21756327:16	Potential clinical implications of our results, including the proposed biomarkers, will require independent studies.

20398251:0	Background 
Thanks to various technical and imaging innovations, pure laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is now performed worldwide for radical nephrectomy and is considered to be safe and effective, while also improving the quality of life .
20398251:1	However, laparoscopy still requires three to four incisions, each of which is about 1-2 cm long.
20398251:2	Every incision is associated with the risk of bleeding, hernia, and/or internal organ damage, and incrementally worsens the cosmetic outcome . Furthermore, several problems remain to be solved with regard to laparoscopy, including the use of CO 2, the size of the incision for retrieving the resected specimen, the need for trocar ports, and the high cost of equipment.
20398251:3	Alternatives to conventional laparoscopy include single-site surgery, which is known as laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery ( LESS ), as well as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).
20398251:4	In 1998, Kihara et al . reported on minimum incision endoscopic surgery (MIES) performed via a single small incision in Japan, which was an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems and reduce technical difficulties [ - ].
20398251:5	MIES is performed via a single small incision that just permits extraction of the resected specimen, and is done without gas or trocar ports [ - ].
20398251:6	Kihara et al . subsequently reported that radical nephrectomy by single MIES was a safe, reproducible, cost-effective, and minimally invasive treatment option for T1-3aN0 M0 renal tumors . In April 2001, we started to employ single MIES for nephrectomy , partial nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, adrenalectomy, and radical prostatectomy, with two main operators (T.K* and K-I.Y) performing the procedures.
20398251:7	In 2006, MIES was recognized as a method of advanced surgery by the Japanese government and it has been covered by the Japanese universal health insurance system since 2008 . Single MIES is based on both standard open surgery and modified hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery , so the instruments employed are the same as those used for open surgery or laparoscopic surgery and it only requires a short time to learn the technique [ - ].
20398251:8	Because MIES is performed via a small incision, the surgical field is very limited.
20398251:9	Accordingly, complete information about the renal tumor, renal vessels, and adjacent structures needs to be obtained preoperatively so that the surgeon can select the appropriate procedure.
20398251:10	Moreover, the renal arteries and veins show anatomical variations that must be clarified before attempting surgical treatment, in order to reduce the risk of unexpected bleeding.
20398251:11	It has been reported that three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CT images (3D-CT) and/or 3D-CT angiography (CTA) are useful modalities for viewing the renal arteries that are less invasive than conventional angiography [ - ], and can be utilized for navigation when retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy is performed for renal tumors .
20398251:12	Since 2003, we have performed preoperative 3D-CT for evaluation of the renal arteries and veins, as well as the relations between the renal hilar vessels and adjacent structures, in order to improve the outcome of MIES nephrectomy.
20398251:13	In the present study, we reviewed the results of MIES radical nephrectomy for renal tumors in 80 consecutive patients treated by one chief operator (T.K*).
20398251:14	We assessed the usefulness of 3D-CT images and the method of safely approaching the renal hilum during MIES nephrectomy.
20398251:15	Methods 
Results 
Nephrectomy was performed successfully by single MIES in all 80 patients.
20398251:16	The baseline demographic, clinicopathological, intraoperative, and postoperative data of the subjects are summarized in Tables and .
20398251:17	Although there were no operative complications, we extended the incision by 1 to 2 cm in four patients (for extraction of large tumors in two and to control hemorrhage from the left renal veins in two).
20398251:18	Bleeding was successfully controlled in the two patients with left renal vein hemorrhage and no patient required blood transfusion.
20398251:19	Preoperative 3D volume-rendered image reconstruction was done in 60 patients, revealing that 48 patients had one renal artery and one renal vein, while 12 patients had two or three renal arteries and/or veins.
20398251:20	As shown in Table the number of renal arteries and veins detected at operation corresponded exactly with the preoperative 3D-CT findings (100% sensitivity and specificity).
20398251:21	The 80 patients were divided into four groups of 20 patients each.
20398251:22	The first 20 nephrectomies were performed without 3D-CT data, while the other 60 nephrectomies were done after preoperative virtual surgery was performed with 3D-CT images.
20398251:23	There were no differences of tumor size among the four nephrectomy groups (Figure.
20398251:24	Table ).
20398251:25	There was a positive correlation between the operating time and blood loss in all 80 patients (Figure.
20398251:26	).
20398251:27	The incision was shorter in the second to fourth nephrectomy groups than in the first group (Figure.
20398251:28	).
20398251:29	Compared with the operating time (mean ± S.D. = 149.7 ± 34.5 min) for the initial 20 nephrectomies performed without virtual surgery, there was a significant decrease in the second (124.8 ± 25.7 min, P = 0.0136), third (123.6 ± 27.1 min, P = 0.0113), and fourth (118.1 ± 20.3 min, P = 0.0011) groups in which nephrectomy was done after preoperative 3D simulation (Figure.
20398251:30	).
20398251:31	There were no differences of the operating time between the second, third, and fourth groups.
20398251:32	Similarly, blood loss in the second (221.6 ± 138.1 ml, P = 0.1449), third (144.4 ± 106.7 ml, P = 0.0105), and fourth (108.8 ± 103.7 ml, P = 0.0026) groups was smaller than in the first group (326.3 ± 282.8 ml, Figure.
20398251:33	).
20398251:34	There were no differences between nephrectomy on the right and left sides with regard to the operating time (127.0 ± 25.4 vs. 131.3 ± 33.7 min, P = 0.5199, Figure.
20398251:35	) or blood loss (180.2 ± 147.9 vs. 222.4 ± 228.2 ml, P = 0.8397, Figure.
20398251:36	).
20398251:37	The tumor size was not different among the four groups (Figure.
20398251:38	).
20398251:39	For left nephrectomy, the operating time was dramatically shorter when the procedure was done after preoperative simulated surgery than when it was done without simulation (the first group), and there was less blood loss in the subsequent three groups than in the first group (Figure.
20398251:40	).
20398251:41	For surgery on the right side, blood loss was decreased and the operating time was somewhat shorter when nephrectomy was done after simulated surgery (Figure.
20398251:42	).
20398251:43	Both the operating time and the blood loss were positively correlated with tumor size (Figure.
20398251:44	).
20398251:45	Nephrectomy was more rapid for tumors with a diameter <4 cm (T1a) than for tumors >4 cm in diameter (≥ T1b) (120.7 ± 23.9 vs. 147.4 ± 32.7 min, P < 0.0001, Figure.
20398251:46	), and was associated with less blood loss (155.1 ± 109.9 vs. 299.6 ± 277.5 ml, P = 0.0013, Figure.
20398251:47	).
20398251:48	We also analyzed the influence of tumor size and location on the operating time and blood loss.
20398251:49	Tumors that were dorsal, at the lower pole, and/or large required a longer operating time and were associated with greater blood loss (Figure.
20398251:50	).
20398251:51	With regard to BMI, there was a difference of the operating time between patients with a BMI < 25 (n = 46) and those with a BMI > 25 (n = 34) (119.8 ± 24.7 vs. 141.5 ± 31.2 min, P = 0.0005, Figure.
20398251:52	).
20398251:53	There was also a difference of blood loss between patients with a BMI < 25 or >25 (162.8.2 ± 147.9 vs. 251.0 ± 228.5 ml, P = 0.0330, Figure.
20398251:54	).
20398251:55	The operating time tended to get shorter across the four nephrectomy groups in patients with a BMI > 25, while blood loss was smaller in the subsequent groups than the initial group among patients with a BMI < 25 (Figure.
20398251:56	).
20398251:57	Discussion 
Since we were familiar with the anatomical frame, landmarks, and operative technique of radical nephrectomy for cT1-3aN0 M0 renal tumors via the translumbar approach, we also employed this approach for single MIES nephrectomy . Our results demonstrate that radical nephrectomy can be safely performed as a single MIES procedure.
20398251:58	As can be seen in Table the background factors, operating time, blood loss, and postoperative recovery time of our series were compatible with previous results reported by Kihara et al . . Therefore, as Kihara et al . also concluded, radical nephrectomy by single MIES is safe, reliable, and minimally invasive.
20398251:59	The extraperitoneal subcostal translumbar approach avoids the risk of peritoneal contamination and also results in earlier resumption of normal bowel function following surgery.
20398251:60	We used images created by 3D-CT to display the location of the kidney in relation to the lower rib cage, iliac crest, and spine, thereby helping the surgeon to accurately plan the initial incision.
20398251:61	The position of the kidney and the location and size of the tumor(s) determined the length of the incision.
20398251:62	Preoperative 3D imaging of the renal arteries and veins provides useful information for laparoscopic nephrectomy . Single MIES is performed via a single small incision, detailed anatomical information is required in order to approach the renal artery and vein safely as the operation progresses step-by-step with manipulation of the endoscope and instruments through the narrow single incision.
20398251:63	Retrospective analysis of the initial 20 MIES nephrectomies suggested several issues.
20398251:64	First, it is very important to define the location and the number of renal arteries and veins, as well as their relations to gain structures, before performing MIES nephrectomy.
20398251:65	Second, it is necessary to gain sufficient knowledge in order to accurately approach and locate the renal vessels during MIES nephrectomy, because the renal artery must be ligated and divided before the renal vein.
20398251:66	Therefore, it is important to approach the renal artery in a safe and appropriate manner.
20398251:67	Third, there are reported to be some anatomical differences of these vessels between the right and left sides (Figure.
20398251:68	).
20398251:69	In order to overcome these problems, we performed preoperative 3D-CT.
20398251:70	We used the volume rendering method for reconstruction of 3D images because it retains all data by summing the contributions from each voxel along a line set at any viewing angle through a stack of axial images.
20398251:71	After 3D images have been created, two-dimensional images can also be obtained.
20398251:72	That is, the 3D-CT images can be employed to view the kidney in different positions and 2-dimensional images can be created in any desired plane, allowing clear demonstration of the relation between the tumor and the renal vessels or adjacent structures.
20398251:73	If perirenal collateral veins are detected in a patient by 3D-CT, we must pay careful attention when dissecting the kidney from the surrounding fibrous connective tissue.
20398251:74	Marukawa et al . reported that 3D imaging achieved almost perfect detection of renal arteries and veins, and that 3D simulation of retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy could help surgeons to avoid various operative risks and possible complications . In our study, the number of renal arteries and veins corresponded completely with the preoperative 3D-CT data (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity).
20398251:75	With preoperative virtual surgery, we cannot actually perform dissection between the psoas fascia and Gerota's posterior fascia to approach the renal hilar vessels, but performing the virtual procedure is likely to provide more information than that gained from careful study of standard axial CT scans.
20398251:76	Comparison between our first 20 nephrectomy procedures and the next 20 revealed a shorter operating time and smaller blood loss in the latter group, while the third and fourth nephrectomy groups also had a shorter operating time and smaller blood loss than the first group (Figure.
20398251:77	).
20398251:78	Irrespective of the lack of a difference in tumor size or side among patients from the first to fourth groups undergoing right nephrectomy, blood loss was markedly decreased and the operating time was shorter in patients from the second to fourth nephrectomy groups with preoperative virtual surgery than in those from the first group without it (Figure.
20398251:79	).
20398251:80	Also, the operating time was dramatically shorter and blood loss tended to be smaller in second to fourth groups than the first group of patients undergoing left nephrectomy (Figure.
20398251:81	).
20398251:82	These findings suggest that both the approach and the time required to manage the renal hilar vessels differ between the right and left sides.
20398251:83	On the right side, the renal artery is easily located on the posterior surface of the IVC at the level of the middle part of the kidney and handling the renal vein is relatively simple, while it takes more time to find the left renal artery and to manage the left renal vein and its branches.
20398251:84	Based on data from preoperative 3D simulation, MIES nephrectomy itself, and re-evaluation of our surgical technique by reviewing operative videos for the subsequent 60 nephrectomies, we have developed a successful method of approaching the kidney and handling the hilar vessels.
20398251:85	As described in Methods, our surgical approach to the hilar vessels was improved by reviewing the 3D-CT information.
20398251:86	Resection of dorsal, lower pole and/or large tumors took longer and was associated with more blood loss (Figure.
20398251:87	).
20398251:88	In addition to a shorter operating time and smaller blood loss, our results indicated that the incision was smaller in the second to fourth nephrectomy groups than in the first group despite a similar tumor size, and there were no serious complications (Figure.
20398251:89	).
20398251:90	In particular, for patients with T1a renal tumors 2-3 cm in diameter that were not protruding outside the kidney, we could safely perform MIES nephrectomy via a 4.5-5 cm incision.
20398251:91	Furthermore, in comparison to the initial 20 nephrectomies without preoperative simulated surgery, the time to reach renal artery was shorter for the subsequent 60 nephrectomies with simulated surgery (15.8 ± 12.7 vs. 24.1 ± 18.6 min, P = 0.0711, data not shown), indicating that we found the vessels at the expected location.
20398251:92	Therefore, the use of 3D-CT data not only improves the surgical incision and the approach to the renal hilar vessels, but may also decrease operative complications.
20398251:93	The body habitus of the patient is well known to significantly influence the operating times.
20398251:94	In the present study, patients with a BMI > 25 had a longer operating time and more bleeding than those with a BMI < 25.
20398251:95	Also, the operating time was shorter for patients with a BMI > 25 and bleeding was significantly less for those with a BMI < 25 when the subsequent 60 nephrectomies were compared to the initial 20 nephrectomies (Figure.
20398251:96	).
20398251:97	These results may reflect both the feedback effect and the learning curve related to accumulation of experience with virtual operations and actual MIES nephrectomy, indicating that virtual surgery based on 3D-CT data may be useful for identifying the renal hilar vessels and their relations to adjacent structures, allowing MIES nephrectomy to be performed more safely.
20398251:98	However, a randomized trial comparing the outcome for patients with or without preoperative virtual surgery should be performed in order to confirm that simulation employing 3D-CT images is useful.
20398251:99	Single MIES is based on standard open surgery, but we use a flexible high-definition laparoscope for easy identification of tissue planes and more precise dissection with minimal trauma.
20398251:100	Many of the longer instruments used in open surgery can be inserted into the narrow incision and employed for single MIES, so it has a lower cost than conventional laparoscopic surgery (30-40% lower).
20398251:101	Moreover, the assistants are now performing single MIES as chief operators at our hospital.
20398251:102	Because of their experience with the surgical technique, including direct vision and viewing video images as assistants during single MIES procedures, they had a relatively short learning period.
20398251:103	Another advantage of single MIES is that the incision can be extended quickly if required.
20398251:104	In patients with a single, small (<4 cm), and localized renal cell carcinoma, nephron-sparing surgery has become more common due to advances in renal imaging, improved surgical techniques, an increase of incidentally discovered low-stage renal cell carcinomas, and good tumor control and potentially better overall survival have been reported in patients undergoing this procedure . Therefore, radical nephrectomy is no longer the standard type of surgery for such tumors and may even be detrimental .
20398251:105	It has been reported that 3D-CT provides superior images of the renal vessels and collecting system, and thus is useful for nephron-sparing surgery [ , ].
20398251:106	The technique of performing MIES nephrectomy after virtual surgery based on 3D-CT with reconstruction of images by the volume rendering method can also be used for MIES nephron-sparing surgery and MIES adrenalectomy.
20398251:107	At present, we perform all of these types MIES after preoperative virtual surgery.
20398251:108	MIES nephron-sparing surgery has been increasing every year.
20398251:109	We performed this nephron-sparing procedure via a 3-4 cm incision for the above-mentioned renal tumors and have had no complications or local recurrence (data not shown).
20398251:110	Since we have no experience of LESS or NOTES, we could not determine whether those procedures or single MIES were superior or not.
20398251:111	However, any of these new single-site laparo-endoscopic procedures may be a potential alternative to conventional open or laparoscopic surgery.
20398251:112	Conclusion 
Single MIES radical nephrectomy can be performed more safely by utilizing 3D-CT images for virtual surgery, resulting in a shorter operating time and less blood loss.

21242527:0	Introduction 
International data demonstrate that the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in hospitalised adults ranges from 2.9% to 16.6%.
21242527:1	Physiological and developmental differences in children could make them more vulnerable to harm, yet no data from methodologically similar studies in full paediatric populations exist.
21242527:2	Published AE rates in children range from 0.2 to 154 per 10 000 discharge records, and 1 to 2.96 per 100 discharges.
21242527:3	Chart reviews targeting specific paediatric populations and specific types of AEs reveal much higher rates.
21242527:4	Identifying a composite paediatric AE rate has been hampered by the absence of a single tool suitable for examining AEs across paediatric populations and events.
21242527:5	No single method can identify all harm associated with patient care.
21242527:6	Concurrent use of complementary methods in real time and retrospectively for AE detection has been recommended.
21242527:7	Trigger tool (TT) methodology, however, is considered the best single tool, given its tiered approach and sensitivity to AE detection.
21242527:8	It can be customised to diverse settings and, used consistently, can accurately measure harm over time.
21242527:9	The use of screening criteria to identify charts with possible harm followed by an in-depth review for actual harm has been used for decades, including the landmark Harvard Medical Practice Study.
21242527:10	More recently, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has recommended use of their Global Trigger Tool (IHI-GTT) for local quality-improvement activities.
21242527:11	Although focused paediatric TTs have been described, there remains no TT validated to detect AEs across all age groups of hospitalised children and youth.
21242527:12	There are growing efforts to improve patient safety in paediatrics, and quantification of the burden of iatrogenic harm in children could catalyse awareness and stimulate changes in paediatric practice and healthcare policy, as occurred following publication of adult AE rates.
21242527:13	The Patient Safety Collaborative of the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres established a working group to develop a paediatric TT (CPTT) to detect AEs in children hospitalised in Canada.
21242527:14	The goal was to develop a reliable and robust tool that could be used for both local quality-improvement activities and research into the rate, incidence, and factors contributing to AEs across a large population.
21242527:15	The rigorous processes used to develop, test the feasibility of use of and validate the CPTT in detecting AEs are outlined in this paper.
21242527:16	Patients and methods 
The early development stages of the CPTT have been previously reported.
21242527:17	Briefly, five TTs identified through a detailed literature review and personal communications were adapted to the modular format of the IHI-GTT.
21242527:18	The Care, Medication, Surgical and Intensive care modules were retained, and two modules added: Laboratory and Other.
21242527:19	Screening criteria from all other TTs were mapped against this list, duplicate triggers were removed, and additional triggers recommended and approved by consensus were added.
21242527:20	Each trigger in the resulting 94-trigger tool was evaluated for risk priority, frequency and detectability.
21242527:21	Triggers above a pre-established cut-off or mean risk score were retained.
21242527:22	Using a modified Delphi process, the remaining triggers were evaluated by a team of clinical paediatric patient safety experts who eliminated half, resulting in the preliminary 47-trigger CPTT.
21242527:23	Pilot testing of the CPTT 
The CPTT was piloted in three acute care paediatric settings in Alberta: a stand-alone paediatric unit in a community hospital, a paediatric hospital-within-a-hospital and a regional paediatric centre.
21242527:24	At each site, five medical and five surgical charts were selected for audit from fiscal year 2004 from each of three age groups: 29–365 days, 366 days to 5 years and over 5 years; 10 charts were randomly selected from the fourth age group of 0–28 days.
21242527:25	Two nurses visited the hospitals between June and August 2005, and independently reviewed all 40 charts at each hospital using the draft trigger tool.
21242527:26	Each nurse had undergone detailed chart abstraction training as carried out for the Canadian Adverse Event Study, and reliability was tested using a set of standard charts.
21242527:27	Reviewers were asked to record any difficulties with interpretation or application of trigger definitions with particular emphasis on potential duplication or impracticality.
21242527:28	Nurses were also asked to identify any triggers they thought should be considered for exclusion by the Research Team.
21242527:29	Their experience was that the tool could be used to assess the charts, and no triggers were identified that could be eliminated.
21242527:30	The κ statistic for the measurement of inter-rater reliability (IRR) for triggers in 120 charts reviewed was 0.81, and the validation study was commenced.
21242527:31	Definitions 
Based on the definition used in previous national studies of AEs, an AE was defined as an unintended injury or complication that results in disability at the time of discharge, death, prolonged hospital stay or subsequent hospitalisation, and is caused by healthcare management.
21242527:32	The AE had to occur within a 3-month period before or during the index admission and be detected during or within the 3-month period before or after the admission.
21242527:33	‘Healthcare management’ included the actions of individual hospital staff, as well as the broader systems and care processes, and included acts of omission and commission.
21242527:34	To qualify as an AE, healthcare management must have received a causation rating of at least 4 on a six-point scale, that is, greater than 50% likelihood of being caused by healthcare management.
21242527:35	The tool was validated by separate nurse and physician reviews of the same charts of children hospitalised in six academic paediatric health sciences centres (IWK Hospital Halifax; Children's Hospital of Winnipeg; Alberta Children's Hospital Calgary; Stollery Children's Hospital Edmonton; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Ottawa; SickKids Hospital Toronto) during the fiscal year 2005/2006.
21242527:36	Validation included the use of the TT on a sample of paediatric patient charts and the assessment of those charts to determine if AEs were present.
21242527:37	Results of validation testing 
After training for the validation study, the κ statistic for IRR for nurse-identified triggers and physician-identified AEs was 0.62 and 0.57, respectively, and 0.67 for the IRR for nurses at each participating site.
21242527:38	Five hundred and ninety-one of the 600 charts reviewed by nurses were available for physician review; the others were misfiled or on the clinical wards where the patient was currently hospitalised.
21242527:39	Of the 591 charts reviewed by both nurses and physicians, 361 (61.1%; 95% CI 57.2 to 65.0) had at least one trigger: 148 (41%) had one, 145 (40.2%) had two, three or four, and 59 (16.3%) had five or more triggers.
21242527:40	Physicians identified 340 injuries in 180 of the 591 charts.
21242527:41	In 89 charts, the injuries met the criteria for AEs, for an AE rate of 15.1% (95% CI 12.2% to 17.1%).
21242527:42	The distribution of AEs by age and gender is displayed in .
21242527:43	Of the 89 patients with an AE, 37 (41.6%) were designated as resulting from acts of commission, 34 (38.2%) from acts of omission and six events (6.7%) from both; and 12 (13.5%) were not categorised.
21242527:44	Nurses' assessment of harm and AEs varied by the classification method used, and also differed from physicians' assessment.
21242527:45	MDs found AEs in 34 charts that nurses assigned ‘No Harm’; otherwise, nurses were more likely to identify AEs in charts at all levels of harm severity.
21242527:46	Nurses and physicians agreed on the presence of an AE in 489 (82.7%) of the charts for a κ of 0.34 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.43).
21242527:47	The PPV and ratio of false-positive to true positive predictors of an AE for each trigger were calculated.
21242527:48	The PPV ranged from 0 to 83.3.
21242527:49	Based on these results, and in order to improve the efficiency of the CPTT, 11 triggers were removed: eight with a low predictive value and ratio of >0.7, and three that were never selected.
21242527:50	A fourth unselected trigger, ‘wrong site surgery,’ was retained, and the two readmission triggers merged (C03 and C16).
21242527:51	These revisions resulted in the final 35-trigger CPTT.
21242527:52	Discussion 
Several agencies, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, have argued that indicators needed to be developed for specific populations, including paediatrics.
21242527:53	We concluded that a robust TT, validated for paediatric use, was necessary for evaluating AEs and conducting a national paediatric study in Canada.
21242527:54	Unlike the IHI-GTT where individual modules were validated separately, the CPTT has been validated for use as a single tool for all paediatric populations.
21242527:55	Similar to the other national studies of AEs, use of our tool calls for a two-stage review process: first, nurses use the trigger tool to identify charts likely to have an AE, followed by physicians who review the triggered charts for AEs.
21242527:56	However, in order to establish the sensitivity of the nurse review, all charts in this study were reviewed independently for triggers (by nurses) and for AEs (by physicians and nurses).
21242527:57	This process is the first of its kind to establish a false-negative rate for triggered charts, by identifying patients with AEs whose charts were not triggered.
21242527:58	The number of false-negative charts may be reduced through education highlighting use of the ‘other’ trigger by the nurses.
21242527:59	Nurse and physician review of all charts for AEs also demonstrated differences between these groups in designating AEs.
21242527:60	Nurses and physicians assessed the charts using somewhat different methods.
21242527:61	Nurses reviewed charts using the CPTT and assessed all charts in terms of the NCC-MERP Harm Scale and the presence of AEs, whereas physicians reviewed all charts for AEs only.
21242527:62	These different methods mean their results are not strictly comparable.
21242527:63	However, the physicians read each case from admission to discharge, and based on these findings, it appears that physicians may be better qualified to assess the presence of AEs.
21242527:64	This difference between nurse and physician assessment of AEs is consistent with previous findings, but these findings should be explored further.
21242527:65	There are inherent limitations in TT methodology.
21242527:66	The utility of any chart review is subject to the quality of the documentation.
21242527:67	Like other screening tests, TTs have a high sensitivity and relatively low specificity.
21242527:68	However, their purpose is to cull charts unlikely to have an AE, leaving behind for physician review only those charts with a high probability of having an AE.
21242527:69	The IRR of identifying AEs through chart review is variable; previous studies reported κ scores ranging from −0.077 to 0.66.
21242527:70	Combining ratings from more than one physician and monitoring reviewer performance during the study with personal feedback may improve IRR.
21242527:71	However, a recent report suggests that a review process involving two physicians per chart is no more reliable than only one in detecting AEs.
21242527:72	Additional training that includes a consensus approach on the number of AEs in the training charts has been used successfully.
21242527:73	Finally, previous national studies of AEs have focused on those characterised by significant harm, that is NCC-MERP categories F–I, underestimating the total burden of harm by disregarding events with temporary harm requiring intervention only (category E events).
21242527:74	Although achieving high IRR for category E can be challenging, capturing these events in future studies will result in a more comprehensive view of the nature of iatrogenic injury, and permit comparisons with recent studies of AEs in children and youth that have used the expanded definition.
21242527:75	Despite these limitations, the use of a broad paediatric population sample to validate the CPTT permits its use in other acute care paediatric institutions.
21242527:76	With its final refinements, the validated CPTT offers the first comprehensive evidence-based tool for assessing harm in hospitalised children and youth.
21242527:77	Conclusion 
The CPTT is the first valid and reliable TT for detecting harm in children and youth of all ages hospitalised in acute care.
21242527:78	This 35-trigger tool is reliable and robust, and can be used in quality-improvement initiatives and for more rigorous research agendas.
21242527:79	Future research should focus on improving the efficiency of the CPTT and investigating the differences between nurse and physician assessments of AEs.
21242527:80	The CPTT is likely to be of interest to researchers wishing to comprehensively study the epidemiology and burden of iatrogenic harm in hospitalised children and youth, using a methodology similar to the previous national studies of AEs in hospitalised adults.
21242527:81	Such studies will enhance current efforts to raise the profile of paediatric patient safety issues.
21328039:0	Introduction 
Demographic trends and changes in economic production are major factors driving anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., O’Neill et al. ), which, in turn, are most likely responsible for the observed increase in average global temperatures over the last few decades (IPCC ).
21328039:1	Although several demographic quantities are potentially important determinants of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., O’Neill and Chen ; Schipper ), most models used to develop emissions scenarios explicitly consider only population size or, in a few cases, some aggregate measures of age structure (O’Neill ).
21328039:2	This article contributes to the study of the effect of changing population age structure on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), the gas that accounts for most of the anthropogenic-driven greenhouse effect.
21328039:3	I offer new methodological perspectives that bridge the gap between the literatures on IPAT-based approaches (e.g., Chertow ) and environmental input-output modeling (e.g., Hendrickson et al. ).
21328039:4	I propose a model that can be interpreted as a generalization of the IPAT equation to a multisector economy with an age-structured population.
21328039:5	The model provides a unified interpretation of previous IPAT-based studies of the effect of population age composition and economic structure on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:6	It can also be seen as a static version of the general equilibrium model, with multiple dynasties of households, as suggested by Dalton et al..
21328039:7	A major contribution of the article is the development of methods to estimate the life cycle profile of CO 2 emissions for individuals.
21328039:8	The methodologies that I propose are applied to data for the United States, showing that the expected change in population age structure over the next four decades is likely to have a positive, but rather small, impact on CO 2 emissions, holding everything else constant.
21328039:9	Background 
Two main approaches have been proposed to study the role played by population age structure in shaping the level of greenhouse gas emissions.
21328039:10	The first approach originates from the conceptual framework provided by the so-called IPAT equation (Commoner ; Ehrlich and Holdren ).
21328039:11	The second approach mostly relies on integrated energy-economic growth models, such as the Population-Environment-Technology model, that are calibrated with household demographic projections, input-output economic tables, and estimates of consumption expenditures, savings, labor supply, etc. (e.g., Dalton et al. ).
21328039:12	The IPAT equation is an accounting identity that was proposed in the early 1970s to conceptualize the multiplicative role of population size on measures of environmental disruption (Commoner ; Ehrlich and Holdren ).
21328039:13	The identity decomposes environmental impact ( I ) into the product of population size ( P ), affluence ( A ), and technology ( T ):
 where affluence is operationalized as per-capita income ( Y / P ), and technology is expressed as environmental impact per unit of economic production ( I / Y ).
21328039:14	The IPAT equation was suggested in a period when environmental concerns focused on the ability of the environment to absorb pollutants that are by-products of modern technology (e.g., pesticides, asbestos, radioactive waste, petrochemicals, household waste) (Pebley ; Ruttan ).
21328039:15	In the early 1990s, environmental concerns shifted toward changes occurring on a global scale, such as climate change.
21328039:16	In this new context, the IPAT conceptual framework has strongly influenced research carried out by demographers on the impact of demographic factors on greenhouse gas emissions (Pebley ).
21328039:17	Dietz and Rosa made the IPAT equation operational for statistical analysis.
21328039:18	Their formulation, known as STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology), has been extensively used to evaluate the role of demographic factors in the explanation of CO 2 emissions.
21328039:19	Population size has been the main demographic variable under analysis.
21328039:20	Dietz and colleagues estimated a unitary elasticity of CO 2 emissions with respect to population size, using a cross-national data sample (Dietz and Rosa ; Rosa et al. ; York et al. ). They thus empirically supported the underlying assumption of the IPAT equation of unitary elasticity of I with respect to P . On the other hand, Shi obtained a higher estimate.
21328039:21	Based on a panel data set for 93 countries for the period 1975–1996, Shi estimated that a 1% increase in population size raises emissions on average by 1.4%.
21328039:22	The role of several demographic variables on CO 2 emissions has been evaluated within the context of IPAT-based models.
21328039:23	For instance, York et al. showed that urbanization is positively correlated with CO 2 emissions.
21328039:24	Most importantly for the purposes of this study, the IPAT framework has stimulated some investigation of the effect of changing age structure on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:25	Dietz and Rosa suggested that countries with a higher proportion of working-age population consume more energy and resources and thus produce more emissions.
21328039:26	MacKellar et al. used households, instead of individuals, as the unit of analysis for their IPAT-based model and showed that population aging may have a large, positive impact on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:27	As a matter of fact, population aging is partly responsible for the observed increase in number of households in the more developed regions of the world over the last several decades.
21328039:28	The growth in household numbers in more developed regions of the world is projected to be substantially larger than population growth, leading to higher levels of CO 2 emissions than accounted for by models that do not consider changes in age structure and behavioral determinants of household formation and dissolution (Mackellar et al. ). Shi found a positive association between percentage of population in working age and CO 2 emissions.
21328039:29	Fan et al. concluded that the proportion of the population between ages 15 and 64 has a negative impact on CO 2 emissions for countries with a high income level, whereas it has a positive impact for countries at other income levels.
21328039:30	The effects of age structure are mediated by the labor force’s productions and individual behaviors.
21328039:31	O’Neill and Chen discussed the limitations of IPAT decompositions and provided a standardization exercise for the United States, showing that the increase in the fraction of the population living with a householder older than 65 years will increase residential energy use and decrease transportation energy use, with consequences for CO 2 emissions.
21328039:32	In the IPAT literature, there has been some discussion about the differential impact on CO 2 emissions of population dynamics associated with different economic structures.
21328039:33	For instance, Shi showed that the elasticity of CO 2 emissions with respect to population size depends on the level of income of the country.
21328039:34	The lowest elasticity is estimated for high-income countries (0.83%) and the highest is estimated for lower-middle-income countries (1.97%).
21328039:35	This result is consistent with the observation that the structure of the economy is important for the explanation of levels of emissions (York et al. ) and that the impact of population is different at different levels of development (Fan et al. ). In IPAT-based models, it has thus been suggested to consider the relative importance of manufacture production versus services, to capture the difference in the economic structure of each country (Shi ).
21328039:36	More detailed analyses of the role of the economic structure in the explanation of environmental outcomes have been done using input-output economic models, which date back to the pioneering work of Leontief (e.g. , ).
21328039:37	In the context of demographic analysis of environmental impact, relevant contributions appeared in the 1970s, when the U.S. Commission on Population Growth and the American Future asked Resources for the Future, a research organization, to undertake a project to identify the principal resource and environmental consequences of future population growth in the United States.
21328039:38	The project was an important attempt to assess the environmental consequences of demographic, economic, and technological dynamics using input-output economic tables (Herzog and Ridker ; Ridker ).
21328039:39	The application of input-output economic analysis to environmental studies has grown with the goal of providing information about the environmental impacts of industrial production processes.
21328039:40	This has typically been done by analyzing resource use and flows of industrial products, consumer products, and wastes.
21328039:41	Duchin has worked extensively on the theory and methods that relate changes in technology, lifestyles, and the environment (e.g., Duchin ; Duchin and Lange ).
21328039:42	Among other work, she has discussed the challenge of describing concrete technological and lifestyle alternatives that work best to tackle environmental problems.
21328039:43	She suggested classifying household types in different societies according to common patterns of work, leisure, consumption, attitudes, and values, and to evaluate how activities are carried out in different societies, their outcomes, and the best alternatives to obtain a specific result (Duchin ).
21328039:44	The past two decades have seen increased attention to the role played by consumers and their lifestyles on environmental outcomes (Bin and Dowlatabadi ).
21328039:45	Schipper and colleagues linked energy use to consumers’ activities, time use, and demographic variables.
21328039:46	They estimated that about half of total energy use is influenced by personal transportation, personal services, and home energy use (Schipper ; Schipper et al. ). Reinders et al. extended studies of energy requirements of households in the Netherlands (e.g., Vringer and Blok ) to several European countries.
21328039:47	They used household budget data to evaluate the relationship between household expenditures and energy use, and they found that the share of direct energy in the total energy requirement ranges from 34% to 64% in the countries considered.
21328039:48	Lenzen used an input-output approach to evaluate energy use in Australia.
21328039:49	He concluded that most greenhouse gas emissions are ultimately attributable to household purchases of goods and services and that the increase in emissions is strongly correlated with income growth.
21328039:50	Pachauri and Spreng proposed a study of household energy requirements in India based on input-output tables and found that the main drivers of energy requirements are per-capita expenditures, population trends, and energy intensity in the food and agricultural sectors.
21328039:51	Hertwich reviewed the environmental impact of household consumption in the context of integrated input-output models and life cycle analysis of products.
21328039:52	He showed that in more-developed countries, household consumption is the most important final demand category in terms of energy use and CO 2 emissions.
21328039:53	In developing countries, exports are more important if there are a lot of heavily export-oriented industries.
21328039:54	Peters and Hertwich discussed the advantages of a consumption-based approach versus a production-based approach in constructing greenhouse gas inventories that account for international trade.
21328039:55	Based on a detailed study for Norway, they also showed that the environmental impacts of consumers may be underestimated if emissions embodied in imports are not taken into account (Peters and Hertwich ).
21328039:56	Tukker and Jansen provided a review of studies of environmental impact of products.
21328039:57	The main idea behind these studies is that consumption of households and governments drives the environmental effects of economic activities, both directly and indirectly, through the impacts of production, use, and waste management of economic goods.
21328039:58	Across all studies considered for European countries, expenditures on housing (including heating and electricity use), transportation, and food account for most emissions of CO 2.
21328039:59	In the case of the United States, Bin and Dowlatabadi estimated that CO 2 emissions related to direct influences (emissions that occur while the product or service is in use, e.g., personal travel) are about 70% of those related to indirect influences (emissions that occur during the production and delivery of a product or service, e.g., transportation operation, food).
21328039:60	Their results are partly based on the use of the Environmental Input-Output Life Cycle Analysis (EIO-LCA) model developed at Carnegie Mellon University (Hendrickson et al. ).
21328039:61	The main implication of these studies is that both direct and indirect energy use have to be considered in the evaluation of the role played by consumers’ lifestyles on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:62	The literature that relies on economic input-output tables to analyze the impact of consumption on energy use and CO 2 emissions is extensive.
21328039:63	However, little attention has been given to the role of specific demographic factors, such as population age structure.
21328039:64	Dalton et al. offer a notable exception.
21328039:65	They incorporated household age structure into a dynamic energy-economic growth model and estimated that population aging may reduce long-term CO 2 emissions in the United States.
21328039:66	In this article, I integrate the approaches developed in the two areas of IPAT-based modeling and environmental input-output analysis to evaluate the effect of changing population-age structure on CO 2 emissions in the United States.
21328039:67	Methodologically, I first present a generalization of the IPAT equation to a multisector economy with an age-structured population, and I discuss the insights obtained in the context of stable population theory (e.g., Keyfitz and Caswell ).
21328039:68	Second, I propose a statistical framework to calibrate the theoretical model.
21328039:69	In particular, I suggest a model of household consumption as a function of household size and age structure.
21328039:70	The model is used to evaluate the extent of economies of scale in consumption of energy-intensive goods and to estimate age-specific consumption profiles.
21328039:71	I look at age profiles of consumption from an individual, rather than a household, perspective.
21328039:72	There are advantages and disadvantages to using either households or individuals as the unit of analysis.
21328039:73	For instance, some household characteristics have been identified as key determinants of residential energy demand (e.g., O’Neill and Chen ; Schipper ; Schipper et al. ). In addition, household size may have important consequences on per-capita energy use because of the existence of economies of scale at the household level (e.g., Vringer and Blok ).
21328039:74	On the other hand, within the framework that I propose, the choice of the individual makes it simpler to evaluate the effects of changes in age structure.
21328039:75	It also potentially makes it easier to incorporate the work that I propose into the economic demography literature that explores the macroeconomic consequences of population aging, and whose unit of analysis is the individual (e.g., Lee ; Lee et al. ). 
Empirically, I offer an illustration of the methodologies that I propose using data for the United States.
21328039:76	I estimate the extent of economies of scale in consumption from cohabitation, for a set of energy-intensive goods, and I derive age-specific consumption profiles for the same goods.
21328039:77	These results are then used to estimate an age-specific profile of emissions.
21328039:78	They are also used as inputs for the theoretical model in order to evaluate expected variations in CO 2 emissions associated with changes in population growth and age structure.
21328039:79	The Theoretical Model 
This section is dedicated to the formal discussion of the conceptual scheme that I propose to use to analyze the impact of demographic dynamics on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:80	First, I offer a generalization of the IPAT equation to a multisector economy with an age-structured population.
21328039:81	The model is intended to capture the environmental consequences of changes in population age structure, mediated by levels of per-capita consumption, existing technology, and interrelationships between sectors of the economy.
21328039:82	Second, I formally analyze the effect of changes in mortality and fertility rates on the growth rate and age structure of a stable population, and the related consequences on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:83	I show the analogies between the classical IPAT approach and its generalization, and I discuss the additional insights that can be gleaned from the latter.
21328039:84	Age-Specific Consumption of Energy-Intensive Goods 
The effect of changing population age structure on CO 2 emissions has been discussed from a theoretical point of view so far.
21328039:85	The model presented in Eq.
21328039:86	can also be calibrated to a specific context or country, such as the United States.
21328039:87	Several data sources are necessary to estimate key input quantities, such as consumption profiles, input-output tables, and CO 2 coefficients for production sectors and consumption goods.
21328039:88	Most of these quantities have been estimated for the United States and are already available in the literature (e.g., Bin and Dowlatabadi ; EIO-LCA ; EIA ; Hendrickson et al. ).
21328039:89	The main component that is missing is a set of age-specific consumption profiles for energy-intensive goods.
21328039:90	In this section, I discuss the empirical strategy that I propose, I show some estimates of consumption profiles, and I discuss their relevance.
21328039:91	Comparative Statics of Changing Population Age Structure 
In this section, I evaluate the effect of changes in population age structure on overall levels of consumption of energy-intensive goods and the related CO 2 emissions.
21328039:92	This analysis is an empirical application of the theoretical model expressed in Eq.  and focuses on past and future demographic trends in the United States.
21328039:93	In summary, CO 2 emissions are expressed as a product of distinct components.
21328039:94	The demographic component is represented as a vector of population size by age group.
21328039:95	By multiplying the population vector by a matrix containing age-specific profiles of per-capita consumption for different goods, I obtain the final demand for the consumption goods considered.
21328039:96	A set of coefficients then transform monetary demand for goods into CO 2 emissions.
21328039:97	The coefficients account for both the direct and indirect influences of consumer activities on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:98	Changes in population age structure affect the overall level of consumption and, therefore, CO 2 emissions.
21328039:99	Discussion 
In this article, I discuss the effect of changing population age structure on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:100	Methodologically, I first proposed a generalization of the well-known IPAT equation to account for the role of population age structure and interrelationships between sectors of the economy.
21328039:101	Second, I developed a statistical model to estimate the extent of economies of scale in consumption that arise from cohabitation.
21328039:102	Third, I suggested a technique to estimate age-specific consumption profiles from data on household expenditure and household composition.
21328039:103	Empirically, I offered an application of the methods, based on a set of CO 2-intensive goods for the United States.
21328039:104	I found that per-capita CO 2 emissions increase with age until the individual is in his or her 60s.
21328039:105	Then, per-capita CO 2 emissions tend to decline.
21328039:106	Improvements in life expectancy and low levels of fertility shift the distribution of person-years lived toward old ages.
21328039:107	An exercise of comparative statics shows that this process has a positive, although rather small, effect on CO 2 emissions in the next few decades.
21328039:108	In the longer term, when the proportion of person-years lived at very old ages increases, the effect may become negative, given the estimated age-specific profile of CO 2 emissions.
21328039:109	The empirical analysis performed in the paper mainly serves as an illustration of the methodological contribution and does not represent a comprehensive account of all consumption goods in the economy.
21328039:110	However, the goods have been chosen based on their relevance in terms of CO 2 emissions and account for a large part of CO 2 emissions in the United States, making the results fairly general.
21328039:111	The proposed model and empirical analysis provide a systematization of previous IPAT-based studies that evaluate the effect of population age composition and economic structure on CO 2 emissions (e.g., Dietz and Rosa ; Fan et al. ; Mackellar et al. ; Shi ).
21328039:112	The previous IPAT-based literature on the topic relied on simple measures of age composition and economic structure and did not come to conclusive evidence on their effect on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:113	This study provides a more articulated framework to interpret previous IPAT-based literature and to further develop analytic tools and empirical strategies to evaluate the relationships between demographic dynamics and CO 2 emissions.
21328039:114	The empirical results seem to confirm the recent findings of Fan et al. that the effect of population age composition is related to the economic structure of the economy, and that, in high-income countries, aging has a positive effect on CO 2 emissions, at least in the relatively short term.
21328039:115	The estimated age-specific consumption profiles show a pattern of residential energy use consistent with the one estimated by O’Neill and Chen for the life cycle of households.
21328039:116	The effect of changing population age structure on CO 2 emissions has also been evaluated in literature that relies on energy-economic growth models.
21328039:117	The benchmark study in this area of research is given by Dalton et al..
21328039:118	They used a general equilibrium model with multiple dynasties of heterogeneous households, calibrated with input-output data, to evaluate the effect of aging on CO 2 emissions in the United States.
21328039:119	The model that they proposed can be thought of, to a certain extent, as a dynamic version of the static model that I suggest in this article.
21328039:120	They found that population aging reduces long-term emissions.
21328039:121	The effect of aging on per-capita emissions is not apparent until after 2050 because of population momentum.
21328039:122	In the Dalton et al. model, the most relevant impacts of aging are caused by differentials in labor income across age groups, which generate complex dynamics for consumption and savings.
21328039:123	Their results are driven mainly by the crucial assumption that per-capita labor force participation is fixed over time.
21328039:124	Population aging and the scarcity of young workers then cause a downward trend in per-capita labor income for dynasties, with relevant consequences on per-capita consumption and CO 2 emissions.
21328039:125	The assumption is fairly strong, since it is likely that people in the older age groups will increase their labor force participation, both because of improved health conditions at older ages and because of pressures on the pension system that will translate into increases in the age at retirement or in the number of hours worked.
21328039:126	In this article, I implicitly assume that estimated consumption profiles are sustainable and that the economy will adjust to population aging through changes in labor force participation or the number of hours worked.
21328039:127	Relaxing the assumption of fixed labor force participation in Dalton et al. would likely reduce the difference between their projections for the relatively short term and the results that I present.
21328039:128	In the long term, the reduction in CO 2 emissions due to aging, suggested by Dalton et al., is consistent with the age-specific profile of CO 2 emissions that I estimate and that implies a decrease in CO 2 emissions at very old ages.
21328039:129	There are indications that consumption of energy-intensive goods keeps decreasing at very old ages, although estimates of consumption profiles past age 80 may be highly stochastic due to reduced sample sizes.
21328039:130	If that is the case, in a scenario of rapid population aging, changing population age structure may have a substantial negative effect on CO 2 emissions, as Dalton et al. have suggested.
21328039:131	There are several different ways societies can finance consumption by the elderly, with important consequences on macroeconomic quantities and CO 2 emissions (see, e.g., O’Neill et al. ). In an aging society, current workers may reduce their consumption or work longer to transfer resources to the elderly, either through familial transfers or a PAYGO system.
21328039:132	Alternatively, current workers may save in order to finance their retirement (e.g., through a pre-funded pension system).
21328039:133	Different choices have different consequences on macroeconomic quantities, such as saving rates, and ultimately affect the growth rate of economic output.
21328039:134	Research on these issues is central to the field of economic demography, and results from this discipline are relevant for our purposes.
21328039:135	A significant set of studies focuses on the relationships between economy and demography in golden rule steady states, under several different assumptions (e.g., Cutler et al. ; Diamond ; Lee ; Willis ).
21328039:136	Population aging may generate lower aggregate saving rates but, at the same time, may cause increased capital per worker and higher consumption (Cutler et al. ), which would translate into higher levels of emissions.
21328039:137	Lee has shown that population aging may increase or decrease levels of life cycle consumption across golden rule steady states, depending on whether transfers to children or to the elderly dominate.
21328039:138	It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss in detail the literature on the economic consequences of population aging.
21328039:139	However, I would like to make an important observation about the unit of analysis.
21328039:140	A large body of literature in the field of economic demography relies on representations of the individual economic life cycle.
21328039:141	Although constructing consumption profiles that vary with the age of the household head is simpler, given that data are usually collected at the household level, it is not straightforward to translate changes in population age structure into changes in the age structure of household heads and household memberships.
21328039:142	Moreover, an accounting based on households would not reveal transfers within households, which represent an important share of societal redistribution of resources (Lee et al. ).
21328039:143	The approach that I suggest in this article relies on the estimation of consumption profiles for individuals.
21328039:144	It complements previous works that use households as the unit of analysis and opens possibilities to bridge the gap between the literatures on the demographic determinants of CO 2 emissions and the economic consequences of population aging and intergenerational transfers.
21328039:145	The interpretation of the empirical results that I present is quite focused.
21328039:146	The idea is to evaluate the effect of changes in population age structure on CO 2 emissions, holding all other things constant.
21328039:147	This demographic exercise provides important insights on the life cycle profile of CO 2 emissions.
21328039:148	However, it is important to be aware that several demographic and economic variables are directly or indirectly affected by changes in population age structure.
21328039:149	The estimated consumption profiles are not fixed over time.
21328039:150	Instead, they evolve for several reasons, including changes in age structure.
21328039:151	Population aging is associated with a fairly large increase in the number of households and a reduction in the average household size, which potentially influence age-specific consumption profiles.
21328039:152	Population aging also affects productivity.
21328039:153	For instance, old workers may be more experienced and productive than younger ones.
21328039:154	Conversely, it is possible that young workers are more dynamic and productive.
21328039:155	Depending on which effect is stronger, productivity may increase or decrease with age, with consequences on economic growth and consumption patterns.
21328039:156	My estimates of consumption profiles are based on cross-sectional data and are influenced by the pace of economic growth.
21328039:157	Rapid economic growth raises the income of young people, relative to the elderly, and makes longitudinal profiles of consumption steeper than the ones estimated from cross-sectional data.
21328039:158	Technology is an important variable in the explanation of CO 2 emissions.
21328039:159	The approach used in this article is based on a static representation of technology (e.g., the input-output model).
21328039:160	However, technical change may play a key role in the future.
21328039:161	For instance, reducing the CO 2 intensity of electricity may counteract the effect of increasing consumption due to population aging.
21328039:162	On the other hand, international trade may shift the production of certain goods to countries where the technology in use is more energy-intensive, thus leading to an overall increase in CO 2 emissions which is not captured by input-output tables that do not account for trade.
21328039:163	In this article, I focus on the United States and formalize the intuition that observed patterns of energy use in developed countries imply that population aging may have a positive impact on CO 2 emissions (e.g., Haq et al. ).
21328039:164	I also offer insights for a country like China, one of the main contributors to global CO 2 emissions.
21328039:165	In China, the process of population aging is extremely fast and is likely to have a significant impact on CO 2 emissions.
21328039:166	In particular, population aging comes together with rapid economic growth, which will likely increase the overall level of consumption and will make the age-specific profiles increase more steeply with age.
21328039:167	Changes in age structure potentially have large consequences in developing countries and, more generally, on global CO 2 emissions.
21328039:168	In the context of a developing country, however, it is important to consider the process of aging and reduction in household size together with urbanization.
21328039:169	As a matter of fact, the processes of economic development and urbanization is expected to drive CO 2 emissions in countries like China and India (Dalton et al. ) and need further consideration for estimation and prediction of global CO 2 emissions.
21328039:170	Further research must be pursued in order to inform official forecasts for CO 2 emissions with an improved understanding of the role of demographic dynamics.
21328039:171	In particular, I think that interdisciplinary work to bring together different areas of expertise will be central to improving our understanding of the impact of population dynamics on CO 2 emissions in both developed and developing countries.
20700501:0	Introduction 
Adapting to a changing environment requires constant evaluation of action outcomes.
20700501:1	Reversal learning (Pavlov, ) is an example of how animals can deal with changing environments.
20700501:2	In this paradigm, a subject is first trained to discriminate a rewarded stimulus A+ (where A stands for the stimulus and + for the presence of reward) from a non-rewarded stimulus B− (where − stands for the absence of reward) and once the discrimination is mastered, the contingencies are inversed (A− vs. B+) so that the subject has to learn to reverse its response to A and B.
20700501:3	Reversals tend to be difficult as there are negative transfer effects; e.g., the individual tends to persist in responding to the stimulus that was originally reinforced.
20700501:4	Eventually, however, this tendency becomes weaker, and the response to the alternative stimulus becomes more frequent until it is consistently evoked.
20700501:5	The capacity of animals to solve reversal learning tasks has been extensively studied using different conditioning procedures (for review, see Davey, ).
20700501:6	In multiple reversal learning successive reversals are performed using the same stimuli (e.g. A+ vs. B−, A− vs. B+, A+ vs. B−).
20700501:7	A question underlying this protocol is whether or not animals solve successive discriminations faster (or with fewer errors) with increasing reversal experience.
20700501:8	Indeed, a possible outcome of this kind o experiment is that, after extended reversal training, some animals are able to make the next reversal in the sequence faster or in fewer trials.
20700501:9	They behave as if they have mastered the abstract concept of alternation or of regular sequence.
20700501:10	However, another outcome is also possible if the animal applies a purely associative strategy that averages reinforcements and absence of reinforcements obtained for A and B over trials.
20700501:11	If successive conditioning phases are even, animals end-up responding equally to A and B, thus exhibiting an apparent lack of discrimination.
20700501:12	This performance results from the fact that A and B acquired the same associative strength across trials.
20700501:13	The honeybee, Apis mellifera constitutes an excellent model for studying the strategies implemented by a relatively simple and yet cognitively sophisticated brain (Menzel and Giurfa, ; Giurfa, ) to solve multiple reversal learning.
20700501:14	In a natural context, honeybees are constant pollinators that remain faithful to a single floral species as long as it provides a profitable nectar and/or pollen reward.
20700501:15	The basis for such constancy is the fact that bees learn the floral features (colors, odors, etc) associated with reward (Menzel, Giurfa, ).
20700501:16	Changes in food source profitability occur rapidly so that bees have to quickly switch to another floral species to ensure efficient foraging.
20700501:17	This scenario could promote, therefore, fast solving of multiple reversal learning and eventually mastering the concept of alternation.
20700501:18	On the other hand, it may also be efficient to solve this ecological problem by averaging positive and negative experiences over time, thus deciding whether or not it is timely to switch to another species.
20700501:19	In the laboratory, appetitive learning in honeybees is studied using a Pavlovian conditioning protocol, the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) (Takeda, ; Bitterman et al., ). In this protocol, a hungry bee that is harnessed and whose antennae are touched with sucrose solution exhibits a PER to reach out and suck the sucrose.
20700501:20	Odors to the antennae do not release such a reflex in naive animals.
20700501:21	If an odor is presented immediately before sucrose solution (forward pairing), an association is formed that enables the odor to release PER in a following test.
20700501:22	Thus, the odor can be viewed as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the sucrose solution as the unconditioned stimulus (US).
20700501:23	Differential conditioning with two odors, one rewarded and the other not, is also possible in this frame (Bitterman et al., ) and thus offers the opportunity to study reversal learning performances in honeybees (Ben-Shahar et al., ; Hosler et al., ; Ferguson et al., Komischke et al., ). 
Here we used the olfactory conditioning of PER to study how bees perform in a multiple reversal paradigm.
20700501:24	Our experiment contemplated four consecutive differential conditioning phases involving the same odors, i.e., a first phase of differential conditioning (A+ vs. B−) and three subsequent phases of reversal (A− vs. B+ → A+ vs. B− → A− vs. B+).
20700501:25	We asked whether bees would improve their discrimination performance with successive reversals or whether they would generalize their choice to both odors at the end of conditioning as a consequence of equating their associative strengths.
20700501:26	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Two independent groups of bees were trained along four consecutive differential conditioning phases involving two odorants, 2-hexanol and 2-octanone, and three reversals.
20700501:27	In order to balance odor contingencies, Group 1 ( n = 57 bees) was trained to discriminate 2-hexanol as odor A from 2-octanone as odor B, while Group 2 ( n = 54 bees) was trained to discriminate 2-octanone as odor A from 2-hexanol as odor B (see Table ).
20700501:28	We first compared the performance of both groups along conditioning phases.
20700501:29	Within each phase, there were no significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 as shown by 2 × 2 × 5 (group × stimulus A/B × trial) ANOVA for repeated measurements (Table ).
20700501:30	Thus data from both groups could be pooled.
20700501:31	Figure shows the pooled performance of bees in our experiment ( n = 111 bees).
20700501:32	In the 1st phase (A+ vs. B−), bees successfully learned the discrimination.
20700501:33	A 2 × 5 (stimulus A/B × trial) ANOVA for repeated measurements yielded significant stimulus ( F 1,109 = 157.87;
20700501:34	P < 0.0001) and trial ( F 4,436 = 82.13;
20700501:35	P < 0.0001) effects as well as a significant interaction effect ( F 4,436 = 80.04;
20700501:36	P < 0.0001) showing that responses to odors followed different significant trends during trials depending on their association with sucrose reward.
20700501:37	In the 2nd phase, bees successfully mastered the first reversal as shown by the significant stimulus ( F 1,109 = 6.37,
20700501:38	P < 0.05) and trial ( F 4,436 = 10.16;
20700501:39	P < 0.0001) effects.
20700501:40	Inversion of conditioned responses occurred in the 4th trial, thus yielding a significant stimulus × trial interaction ( F 4,436 = 76.21,
20700501:41	P < 0.0001).
20700501:42	In the 3rd phase, bees again successfully reversed their conditioned responses to odors as shown by the significant stimulus × trial interaction ( F 4,436 = 46.44,
20700501:43	P < 0.0001).
20700501:44	In this case, conditioned responses were inversed in the 3rd trial.
20700501:45	Stimulus and trial effects were, however, not significant (stimulus effect: F 1,109 = 0.98,
20700501:46	NS; trial effect: F 4,436 = 1.97,
20700501:47	NS), probably because both curves were symmetrical, thus leading to a canceling effect for trial and stimulus.
20700501:48	Finally in the last phase, a similar situation as in the 3rd phase was found.
20700501:49	Bees successfully reversed their conditioned responses as shown by the highly significant stimulus × trial interaction ( F 4,436 = 32.86,
20700501:50	P < 0.0001).
20700501:51	In this case inversion of conditioned responses was visible on the 4th trial.
20700501:52	As in the previous, 3rd phase, stimulus and trial effects were not significant (stimulus effect: F 1,109 = 0.44,
20700501:53	NS; trial effect: F 4,436 = 0.61,
20700501:54	NS).
20700501:55	Thus, bees mastered the original discrimination and the three consecutive reversals.
20700501:56	However, Figure shows that effective discrimination decreased along successive conditioning phases.
20700501:57	Indeed the differentiation achieved at the end of each phase decreased along the four phases.
20700501:58	To provide a quantitative analysis of this effect, we computed for each phase a reversal score.
20700501:59	Reversal discrimination learning is successful if there is an increase of conditioned responses to the CS+, based on its excitatory properties acquired through association with sucrose reward, and a decrease in responding to the CS−, based on its inhibitory properties related to the absence of reward.
20700501:60	The excitatory component of reversal (Δ e) can be quantified as the difference in responses to the CS+ between the fifth and the first trial of a reversal phase (Δ e = CS+ trial5 − CS+ trial1).
20700501:61	The inhibitory component (Δ i) can be quantified as the difference in responses to the CS− between the first and the fifth trial of a reversal phase (Δ i = CS− trial1 – CS− trial5).
20700501:62	Both scores were computed for each bee and reversal phase (2nd, 3rd and 4th phases).
20700501:63	Figure shows the average Δ e and Δ i scores obtained ( n = 111).
20700501:64	In the 2nd phase, in which bees experienced the first reversal, the mean excitatory score Δ e was significantly higher than the mean inhibitory score Δ i (Δ e = 0.60; Δ i = 0.34; Wilcoxon test: Z = 7.11, P < 0.0001).
20700501:65	This result indicates that after achieving the first olfactory discrimination (1st phase), bees were better in increasing responses to the formerly non-rewarded odor than in extinguishing responses to the formerly rewarded odor.
20700501:66	In the 3rd phase, excitatory and inhibitory scores were the same (Δ e = 0.32; Δ i = 0.32; Wilcoxon test: Z = 0, NS), thus confirming the symmetric performance.
20700501:67	Finally, in the 4th phase, excitatory and inhibitory scores were also equivalent (Δ e = 0.23; Δ i = 0.21; Wilcoxon test: Z = 0.45,
20700501:68	NS ).
20700501:69	Excitatory and inhibitory scores significantly decreased along consecutive reversal phases (Δ e: F 1,220 = 20.41,
20700501:70	P < 0.0001; Δ i : F 1,220 = 3.17,
20700501:71	P < 0.05).
20700501:72	The excitatory score of the 2nd phase was significantly higher than those of the 3rd and 4th phases (Tukey test: P < 0.0001 in both cases), which did not differ between them.
20700501:73	Similarly, the inhibitory score of the 2nd phase was significantly higher than that of the 4th phase ( P < 0.05) but not of the 3rd phase.
20700501:74	Inhibitory scores of the 3rd and 4th phase did not differ significantly.
20700501:75	Thus, multiple olfactory reversals lead to a progressive decrease in the bees’ ability to reverse the reinforcement contingencies.
20700501:76	As a consequence, differentiation levels reached at the end of each conditioning phase also decreased.
20700501:77	Figure shows the values of a differentiation index (Di) computed for each bee based on its responses in the fifth trial of each conditioning phase.
20700501:78	This index was calculated as the difference between the responses to the CS+ minus the responses to the CS− in the last trial (Di = CS+ trial5 – CS− trial5).
20700501:79	A comparison between Dis calculated for each phase showed a significant decrease of differentiation from the 1st to the 4th phase of the experiment ( F 3,330 = 11.34,
20700501:80	P < 0.0001).
20700501:81	Pos-hoc comparisons (Tukey test) showed that the Di of the 1st phase was significantly higher than those of the other three phases (1st vs. 2nd phase: P < 0.001; 1st vs. 3rd phase: P < 0.01; 1st vs. 4th phase: P < 0.0001), while the Dis of the 2nd and the 3rd phase did not differ significantly.
20700501:82	The difference between the Dis of the 3rd and 4th phase was marginally non-significant ( P = 0.055).
20700501:83	Thus, although bees managed to reverse the learned contingencies along three reversal phases, their success progressively decreased and odorant discrimination was achieved with increasing difficulty.
20700501:84	Figure shows the global responses of the entire population of bees tested.
20700501:85	As such, it may mask differences in individual strategies applied to solve multiple reversal learning.
20700501:86	In order to evaluate the success of an individual in multiple reversal learning, two elemental conditions have to be met: (a) the bee has to master the first olfactory discrimination (1st conditioning phase) because asking about reversal learning is meaningless if the very first learning task was not achieved; (b) the bee has also to succeed in the first reversal (2nd phase) because only then further reversal can be studied.
20700501:87	Taking this into account, we classified bees in three categories: (1) bees that were not able to solve the very first discrimination (i.e., discrimination of the 1st phase; n = 35 bees); (2) bees that mastered the very first discrimination, but were unable to solve the subsequent reversal discrimination of the 2nd phase ( n = 42 bees); (3) bees that solved the discriminations of the 1st and the 2nd phase ( n = 34 bees).
20700501:88	The 1st category represents bees that did not meet condition (a) (see above); the 2nd category represents bees that met condition (a) but not condition (b); finally, the 3rd category represents bees that met conditions (a) and (b), which were, therefore, those for which the question of success in further reversal learning was pertinent.
20700501:89	The criterion used to define success in solving each phase was the presence of a dual correct response in the last (fifth) trial, i.e., PER to the CS+ and absence of PER to the CS−.
20700501:90	Figure shows the performance of the three categories of bees.
20700501:91	Per definition, bees of the 1st category did not master the original discrimination (A+ vs. B−) of the 1st phase and this effect was not limited to the fifth trial (Figure A: F 4,136 = 1.14,
20700501:92	NS).
20700501:93	The 2nd category, which per definition mastered the discrimination of the 1st phase (Figure B: F 4,164 = 80.46,
20700501:94	P < 0.0001), was however unable to master the first reversal task in the 2nd phase.
20700501:95	Although these bees responded differently to the odors ( F 4,164 = 24.36,
20700501:96	P < 0.0001), they seemed unable to revert their response to the formerly rewarded (now non-rewarded) odor A (odor A × trial ANOVA: F 4,164 = 1.69,
20700501:97	NS).
20700501:98	They varied, nevertheless, their responses to the formerly non-rewarded (now rewarded) odor B (odor B × trial ANOVA: F 4,164 = 20.92,
20700501:99	P < 0.0001).
20700501:100	Bees of the 3rd category (Figure C) were successful in solving the discriminations of the 1st ( F 4,132 = 63.52,
20700501:101	P < 0.0001) and the 2nd phases ( F 4,132 = 60.86,
20700501:102	P < 0.0001).
20700501:103	It is, therefore, possible to analyze in this group whether solving a first reversal (2nd phase) improves or not reversal efficiency in the subsequent reversals (3rd and 4th phases).
20700501:104	To answer this question, for all three categories we computed excitatory (Δ e) and inhibitory (Δ i) scores for each reversal phase.
20700501:105	Figure shows the mean Δ e and Δ i scores calculated for each of category.
20700501:106	Even if bees of the 1st category were not able to solve the first discrimination task during the 1st phase, some individuals were able to discriminate odors during the 2nd phase (A− vs. B+), and solved reversal tasks during the 3rd and 4th phases (Figure A).
20700501:107	Their mean excitatory score Δ e (Figure A) was significantly higher than their mean inhibitory score Δ i in the 2nd phase (Δ e = 0.43; Δ i = 0.09; Wilcoxon test: Z = 2.64, P < 0.01).
20700501:108	Although Δ e values were also higher than Δ i values in the 3rd and 4th phases, this difference was not significant (3rd phase: Δ e = 0.41, Δ i = 0.24, Z = 1.52,
20700501:109	NS; 4th phase: Δ e = 0.28, Δ i = 0.17, Z = 1.12,
20700501:110	NS).
20700501:111	Excitatory Δ e and inhibitory Δ i scores (Figure A) did not vary significantly between phases as shown by (score × phase) ANOVA for repeated measurements (Δ e: F 2,68 = 0.48,NS;
20700501:112	Δ i: F 2,68 = 1.48,
20700501:113	NS).
20700501:114	These results underline what seems to be a characteristic feature of these bees: after the first conditioning phase, where no learning was visible, they were more responsive to rewarded than to non-rewarded stimuli (see 2nd, 3rd, and 4th phases in Figure A), thus generating asymmetric curves for both kind of stimuli.
20700501:115	This asymmetry, which is particularly visible in the 2nd phase (first reversal) could be seen, however, as a consequence of category sorting.
20700501:116	Given that bees of the 1st category were, per definition, those not mastering the original discrimination (A+ vs. B−) of the 1st phase, one can argue that inhibitory learning in the 2nd phase has to be necessarily low because bees start from a low PER level due to the lack of excitatory learning in the 1st phase.
20700501:117	In the case of bees of the 2nd category (Figure B), mastering reversal tasks was impossible because these bees were unable to revert their original (1st phase) responses to the rewarded odor A even if they reverted their original (1st phase) responses to the non-rewarded odor B (Figures B and B).
20700501:118	Thus, in the 2nd phase, their inhibitory score was close to 0 (Δ i = 0.05) but their excitatory score was, on the contrary, positive (Δ e = 0.48), and the difference between scores was significant (Wilcoxon test: Z  = 3.36,
20700501:119	P  < 0.001) thus showing that the absence of reversal was highly associated to the lack of extinction of the formerly rewarded odor A and not to the capacity to revert the learning about the formerly non-rewarded odor B (Figure B).
20700501:120	The reversal being impossible in the 2nd phase, the 3rd phase prolonged this situation as the original, non-reversed learning (A+ vs. B−) was again reinforced.
20700501:121	The excitatory score in the 3rd phase was, therefore, close to 0 (Δ e = 0.04) as bees could not improve their already high responsiveness to the rewarded odor (Figure B).
20700501:122	The inhibitory score in this 3rd phase was, nevertheless, more important (Δ i = 0.26), and the difference between Δ e and Δ i was again significant (Wilcoxon test: Z  = 2.21,
20700501:123	P  < 0.05), showing again that these bees could eventually revert their conditioned responses to an odorant that was only partially learned (odor B in the 2nd phase).
20700501:124	Finally, in the 4th phase, bees were again unable to revert the A+ vs. B− discrimination reinforced in the 3rd phase.
20700501:125	Their excitatory and inhibitory scores were equivalent (Δ e = 0.21;
20700501:126	Δ i = 0.29;
20700501:127	Wilcoxon test: Z  = 0.68,
20700501:128	NS), thus showing a delayed and low tendency to start modulating their responses to A and B only in the last phase of the experiment (Figure B; see also Figure B).
20700501:129	A (score × phase) ANOVA for repeated measurements showed significant changes both in excitatory Δ e and inhibitory Δ i scores along phases (Δ e: F 2,82 = 11.98,
20700501:130	P  < 0.0001;
20700501:131	Δ i: F 2,82 = 4.72,
20700501:132	P  < 0.001).
20700501:133	The excitatory score of the 2nd phase was significantly higher than those of the 3rd and 4th phases (Tukey test: 2nd × 3rd phase, P  < 0.001; 2nd × 4th phase, P  < 0.01), which did not differ between them.
20700501:134	At the same time, the inhibitory score of the 2nd phase was significantly lower than that of the 3rd and 4th phases (Tukey test: P  < 0.01 in both cases).
20700501:135	Inhibitory scores of the 3rd and 4th phase did not differ significantly.
20700501:136	These results clearly reflect the high influence of negative transfer effects in the 2nd phase.
20700501:137	Finally, bees of the 3rd category (Figure C), which successfully mastered the original learning (A+ vs. B−) and the first reversal (A− vs. B+), allowed analyzing whether further reversals were improved by these achievements.
20700501:138	Differently from the other two categories (Figure C), both excitatory and inhibitory scores (2nd phase: Δ e = 0.94,
20700501:139	Δ i = 1.00;
20700501:140	3rd phase: Δ e = 0.59,
20700501:141	Δ i = 0.50;
20700501:142	4th phase: Δ e = 0.21,
20700501:143	Δ i = 0.14) were equivalent within each reversal phase (Wilcoxon test; 2nd phase: Z  = 0.00,
20700501:144	NS; 3rd phase: Z  = 0.80,
20700501:145	NS; 4th phase: Z  = 0.63,
20700501:146	NS).
20700501:147	Thus, the capacity of bees to extinguish responses to the formerly rewarded odor was the same as the one to increase responses to the formerly non-rewarded odor in all reversal phases (Figure C).
20700501:148	As for the global analysis, Δe and Δi values of 3rd-category bees significantly decreased along consecutive reversal phases (Δ e: F 2,66 = 32.04, P  < 0.0001;
20700501:149	Δ i: F 2,66 = 50.41,
20700501:150	P  < 0.0001).
20700501:151	All possible comparisons between Δ e or Δ i scores corresponding to two different phases yielded significant difference (Tukey test: Δ e, P  < 0.001 in all cases; Δ i, P  < 0.001 in all cases).
20700501:152	Thus, the analysis of the 3rd category, which included bees that were actually effective in solving olfactory reversals, shows that a progressive decrease in the ability to reverse reinforcement contingencies occurred along successive reversal phases.
20700501:153	Discussion 
The present work shows that bees can master multiple olfactory reversals involving the same two odorants.
20700501:154	In doing this, they do not improve their successive discrimination performances but rather tend to generalize their choice to both odors at the end of conditioning so that both discrimination levels and reversal efficiency (measured through excitatory and inhibitory scores) decreased along experimental phases.
20700501:155	This result invalidates the hypothesis of a learning-to-learn effect, in which case a significant improvement of reversal efficiency should be evident in successive reversal phases.
20700501:156	Comparable results were obtained by Menzel who studied multiple reversal learning in free-flying honeybees trained with two colors, orange and blue.
20700501:157	Using a differential conditioning protocol, Menzel trained honeybees to land five times on one of these colors to get sucrose reward and not on the alternative color that was non-rewarded.
20700501:158	Once the first discrimination was mastered, the color contingencies were inversed as in our experiment.
20700501:159	After three reversals, both colors were equally chosen at the end of the training procedure.
20700501:160	Discrimination recovered only after bees were kept locked up in the hive for a day.
20700501:161	Our results differ in part from those of Menzel because after three reversals, we still observed a significant discrimination between the two trained odorants even if differentiation decreased and bees tended to respond equally to both odors.
20700501:162	Though this difference may be due to different learning dynamics and accuracy in the case of color and olfactory cues and/or to the fact that our bees were restrained in the laboratory while they freely flew in Menzel's experiments, we cannot exclude that adding further reversal phases results in full generalization and equivalent choice levels for both odorants in our experiments.
20700501:163	A more important distinction between Menzel's work and our study is the demonstration provided in our case that not all the bees are equivalent in terms of the strategies they implement when confronted with a multiple reversal learning problem.
20700501:164	An analysis of excitatory and inhibitory scores associated with the responses generated by the CS+ and the CS−, respectively, showed that bees differed in the weight assigned to these two components.
20700501:165	Efficient reversers exhibited comparable excitatory and inhibitory scores within each conditioning phase (Figure C), thus showing that they can equally invert their responsiveness toward excitatory and inhibitory stimuli.
20700501:166	On the contrary, less-efficient reversers were characterized by an asymmetric weight between excitatory and inhibitory components (Figures A,B), which accentuated responses to one (either the CS+ or the CS−) of the stimuli that had to be discriminated.
20700501:167	As a consequence, multiple reversal was partial (Figure A) or did not take place (Figure B) in these bees.
20700501:168	The fact that bees of the same hive differed dramatically in the way they evaluate the CS+ and the CS−, and thus in the way they change their response to them, may be related to their different sensitivities to appetitive and aversive stimuli (Page et al., ; Roussel et al., ; see Page et al., for review).
20700501:169	It has been suggested that appetitive and aversive behavioral syndromes coexist in a honeybee hive (Roussel et al., ). In other words, while some bees exhibit a biased responsiveness to appetitive stimuli (including sucrose and other sensory cues related to the foraging context), other bees exhibit biased responsiveness to aversive stimuli.
20700501:170	These interindividual differences, which may determine different excitatory and inhibitory scores, may underlie the different performances observed in our multiple reversal experiment.
20700501:171	This hypothesis can be easily tested by measuring in individual bees their responsiveness thresholds to appetitive sucrose solution of different concentrations (Page et al., ) and to aversive stimulation with electric shocks of different voltages (Roussel et al., ), measuring in each case the appropriate response, PER and sting extension reflex (SER), respectively.
20700501:172	In this framework, we predict that bees having comparable sensitivity to appetitive and aversive stimuli will be efficient reversers.
20700501:173	Previous work on olfactory reversal learning in honeybees suggested that a learning-to-learn effect may account for the performance of honeybees trained to solve successive olfactory differential conditionings tasks involving different overlapping pairs of odorants (Komischke et al., ). Bees that had experienced three previous reversals were better than bees with no previous reversal experience in solving the final reversal task (Komischke et al., ).
20700501:174	Although we did not find such an effect, the results of Komischke et al. cannot be directly compared with those of our study.
20700501:175	Indeed, while we only used two odorants (A, B) whose valences were simultaneously inversed from phase to phase, Komischke et al. used four odorants (A, B, C, D), and from the two that had to be discriminated within a phase, only the valence of one was inversed at a time, thus reducing the ambiguity of the problem (e.g. A+ vs. B−, B+ vs. C−, C+ vs. D−, D+ vs. A−).
20700501:176	As discussed by Komischke et al., configural learning may have accounted for the bees’ performance in their experiment.
20700501:177	When odor pairs are different (AB, BC, CD, DA) bees can learn each odor pair in terms of a unique configuration in which the specific odor combination determines the appropriate choice.
20700501:178	For instance, bees may learn that in the context of B, A is the rewarded odor, in the context of C, B is rewarded, in the context of D, C is rewarded, etc.
20700501:179	Although bees may use this form of non-elemental processing when solving olfactory discriminations (Deisig et al. , ; Komischke et al., ), it cannot help solving the multiple reversals involving just two odorants, in which the outcome of a given configural unit AB changes from phase to phase.
20700501:180	Bees that could reverse their response to odors A and B along the consecutive phases of our experiment tended to generalize their response to both odors after extensive training.
20700501:181	It seems, therefore, that they determined their response to a given odorant not only based on its actual contingency, but taking also into account previous experiences with it.
20700501:182	Averaging positive and negative experiences along time would yield the progressive decrease in reversal and discrimination observed in our work, which becomes evident at the end of the 4th phase.
20700501:183	This result shows that actual, novel experiences do not erase previous memories but are rather integrated into an updating process that allows reevaluation of the associative strength of a stimulus at any encounter.
20700501:184	This result is consistent with analyses of memory dynamics in honeybees foraging on a patch of artificial feeders providing different rewards (Greggers and Menzel, ).
20700501:185	It was shown that in these experimental circumstances, honeybee decisions are controlled by both short-term memories initiated by the reward just experienced and specific long-term memories of individual feeders within the patch.
20700501:186	In our case, updating previous memories derived from a conditioned phase (e.g. A+, B−) with short-term memories from a subsequent reversal phase (e.g. A−, B+) may lead progressively to equivalent associative strengths for both odorants.
20700501:187	Further reversals may enhance this effect thus resulting in a random choice for both stimuli.
20700501:188	Focusing on the olfactory circuit is necessary to understand the neural basis of multiple reversal learning as studied in our work.
20700501:189	The olfactory pathway (CS pathway) has been well described in honeybees: axons of olfactory receptor neurons located on each antenna project to the antennal lobes where they synapse with approximately 4000 local interneurons and 800 projection neurons.
20700501:190	Each antennal lobe is made of 166 glomeruli, which are the contact sites of these different neuron classes.
20700501:191	Projection neurons convey the processed information via two principal tracts to higher brain structures, the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn.
20700501:192	Mushroom bodies have been traditionally related with learning and memory phenomena (Menzel, ; Giurfa, ).
20700501:193	Specifically, it has been suggested that mushroom bodies are required for solving problems of higher complexity but not necessarily for elemental problems (Giurfa, ; Komischke et al., ; Devaud et al., ; Giurfa, ).
20700501:194	Devaud et al. focused on simple olfactory reversal learning in honeybees and showed that reversible blocking of mushroom body signaling via a local injection of procaine impaired olfactory reversal (e.g. bees having learned to discriminate A+ from B− were unable to reverse to A− vs. B+); however further differential conditioning with two additional odors was left intact (e.g., bees having learned to discriminate A+ from B− could learn to discriminate C+ from D−).
20700501:195	This led to the suggestion that mushroom body activity may be required to solve conflicts between contradictory CS–US associations (Devaud et al., ). If mushroom bodies were required for single reversal learning, it seems logic to suggest that their participation is of fundamental importance for the multiple reversal learning studied in our work as it involves the sequential processing of consecutive contradictory information about associations between CS and US.
20700501:196	Obviously, if mushroom body blocking through local injection of procaine impedes the reversal of a learned discrimination, we expect it to also affect further reversals.
20700501:197	Reversal learning could be the appropriate tool to elucidate the control of neural plasticity in the olfactory circuit.
20700501:198	Recent experiments have shown that following olfactory learning and the formation of a long-term olfactory memory (3 days after conditioning), structural changes are visible at the level of the antennal lobe where some glomeruli increase their volume in an odor-specific manner (i.e., depending on the odor conditioned; Hourcade et al., ). These changes may be due to an increase in synaptic branching for certain glomeruli, resulting from selective gene expression and protein synthesis following long-term memory formation.
20700501:199	However, this mechanism has to be subjected to forms of cellular control as bees learning several flower species throughout their life as foragers, may not be subjected to continuous increases in glomerular volumes within the limits of their head capsule.
20700501:200	One possibility is that switching to another floral species implies a concomitant decrease in those glomeruli that increased previously as a consequence of a first associative experience, together with an increase in the glomeruli that are pertinent for the novel species exploited.
20700501:201	This hypothesis could be tested using reversal learning protocols.
20700501:202	In this case, specific glomerular increases are expected for the first conditioning phase in the case of odor A+ but not for B− (Hourcade et al., ); however, the critical question is what happens to these glomeruli when A+ is reversed to A− and B− is reversed to B+.
20700501:203	This experiment could be done to understand the neural mechanisms underlying reversal plasticity in the olfactory domain.
20700501:204	In an ecological context, honeybee foragers should be prone to reverse efficiently information learned about food sources.
20700501:205	Honeybees are flower constant and exploit, therefore, the same floral species as long as it provides profitable nectar and/or pollen reward (Grant, Chittka et al., ). In temperate biotopes, which are characteristic of European bees, different flower species follow predictable, well-defined flowering periods.
20700501:206	In this context, worker bees must deal with fast changes in pollen or nectar resources and should be prepared to adapt their foraging behavior to changes in stimulus–reward contingencies.
20700501:207	Indeed, when food-source profitability changes, the ability of workers to rapidly switch to another food source will maximize colony productivity.
20700501:208	One can, therefore, argue that reversal learning is an important component of colony fitness.
20700501:209	However, strictly speaking, the protocol of multiple reversal learning conducted in our work would be hardly conceivable in a natural context.
20700501:210	Indeed, in temperate biotopes, where flowering species are replaced one by the another, the scenario of two flower species A and B that would alternatively change their nectar/pollen reward multiple times is unrealistic.
20700501:211	This may explain the progressive decrease in discriminative performance exhibited by the efficient reverser bees, which at the end tended to generalize between both odorants.
20700501:212	This argument does not exclude the possibility that in a natural scenario, bees do indeed “learn-to-learn,” i.e., learn to perform better, when switching between species that follow each other in successive flowering periods.
20700501:213	In this case, ambiguity would be reduced, thus favoring reversal strategies.
20700501:214	In other words, rather than concluding that a learning-to-learn effect does not exist in honeybees, we should state that the particular learning conditions imposed by the natural environment or the experimenter may overshadow or make emerge the “learning-to-learn” effect.
20700501:215	This conclusion is supported by experiments on reversal learning in bumblebees (Chittka, ).
20700501:216	In these experiments, bumblebees were trained to collect sucrose solution in a small T-maze so that they had to choose the right arm when the entrance was marked blue and left when it was yellow.
20700501:217	After a second reversal, bees chose directions randomly for several hundred trials, thus showing interference between the information learned in the first training and in the reversal, consistently with some of our findings.
20700501:218	However, a single bumblebee trained with multiple reversals showed a performance that could be interpreted as a “learning-to-learn” effect; this bee displayed a poor performance until, after more than seven reversals, it detected in an extremely fast way that a reversal took place thus improving dramatically its choices (Chittka, ).
20700501:219	Although this example is based on a single individual and has to be taken, therefore, cautiously, it suggests that an extensive training schedule may make emerge the “learning-to-learn” effect.
20700501:220	Note, however, that in our case, an extensive training schedule would not have the same effect given the important difference between the T-maze experiments with freely-moving bumblebees and our experiments with honeybees in contention.
20700501:221	The latter, contrarily to bumblebees, do not return to the hive to unload the sucrose reward that is provided to them during the training.
20700501:222	As a consequence, feeding sucrose reward during hundreds of trials is not possible because the honeybee's crop has a limited capacity of 60 μl (Núñez, ) and when this capacity is reached and bees are satiated, they do not exhibit the appetitive PER anymore, thus impeding the prosecution of the experiment.
20700501:223	We cannot exclude, nevertheless, that in a free-flying bee protocol of multireversal learning, similar to that used by Menzel but with increasing number of reversals and trials, bees would be able to improve their reversal performance as the bumblebee did it in the experiments of Chittka.
20700501:224	The observation that an increase in the number of trials may lead to the emergence of the “learning-to-learn” effect is consistent with the so-called “overlearning reversal effect” (Menzel, ).
20700501:225	This effect, which determines that in a dual-choice situation reversal to the other alternative is increasingly favored with increasing number of trials, is interpreted either as a loss of US strength or a loss of attention to the conditioned stimuli as a result of a general decrease in motivation (Rescorla and Wagner, ).
20700501:226	In experiments with free-flying bees (Menzel, ) or walking bumblebees (Chittka, ), the general motivation of the bees does not change throughout the series of learning trials because, otherwise, they would not come back to the feeding site on their own.
20700501:227	This might indicate a decrease in the associative strength in predicted US presentations as a mechanism to explain the switch to the alternative stimulus in a dual-choice situation.
20700501:228	The comparison between our experiments and those using freely moving animals, which in turn may also differ depending on variables such as number of reversals and/or number of trials per training phase, reveals that the strategy employed the bees to respond to the problem that is posed to them depends greatly on the design of the experiment and the conditioned stimuli used.
20700501:229	The limitation of PER conditioning for questions on multiple reversal learning derives from the harnessing situation and the fact that bees are not allowed to unload the reward successively delivered to them, thus affecting appetitive motivation if hundreds of trials are required to uncover a “learning-to-learn effect.”
20700501:230	From that point of view, controlled experiments using visual stimuli and free-flying bees are appealing; the experimenter has only to have the persistence to test bees over much longer periods than those already used (Menzel, ), which proved already to be insufficient to uncover such an effect, if any.

20204145:0	Introduction 
In social and financial interactions, timing can be everything.
20204145:1	Whether flirting at the bar or playing a game of poker, it is often considered strategic to conceal your choices with periods of apparent deliberation.
20204145:2	The privacy of such mental events is generally taken for granted, although it may be violated by measuring the brain's electrical or metabolic activity (Libet, et al., ; Soon et al., ). Here we investigate whether an outwardly visible measure, pupil dilation, can predict an individual's decision before it is voluntarily revealed.
20204145:3	Pupillary responses were the focus of numerous psychophysiological studies throughout the 1960’s, 70’s and 80’s (for review see Loewenfeld, ; Andrews and Purves, ; Beatty and Lucero-Wagoner, ).
20204145:4	In these studies, the pupil response was considered to be an index of vaguely defined mental states grouped under general labels such as “arousal” (Bradshaw, ; Yoss et al., ) or “mental activity” (Hess and Polt, ; Kahneman and Beatty, ) that were routinely observed during a variety of cognitive tasks.
20204145:5	The current study was inspired by more recent theories suggesting that Norepinephrine (NE) may play a specific role in consolidating behavioral decisions (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ).
20204145:6	Our aim was to show, for the first time, that similar processes may be important for the consolidation of cognitive decisions, using pupil dilation as a measure of NE release.
20204145:7	The neurotransmitter NE, released by the locus coeruleus (LC) and associated nuclei in the brain stem, has been implicated in a number of cognitive functions associated with memory and attention (for review see Sara, ) and reward anticipation (Bouret and Richmond, ).
20204145:8	Specifically, it has been suggested that NE may play a critical role in the rapid consolidation of behavioral decisions (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ).
20204145:9	As exemplified by animal studies using go/no-go tasks, decision-making models have been specifically aimed at motor outputs and an animal's capacity to rapidly optimize behavioral strategies with respect to reward outcomes (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ).
20204145:10	More recently, this work was extended to a series of human studies using pupil diameter as an index of NE release to explore the role of NE in behavioral outcomes associated with changes in task utility and reward (Gilzenrat et al., ). Extending this research on behavioural decisions, here we used the same measure of pupil dilation to explore whether NE may have an equivalent involvement in consolidating purely cognitive decisions.
20204145:11	In contrast to the pupillary light reflex, which is mediated by acetylcholine and the iris sphincter muscle (Loewenfeld, ), the fluctuation of pupil diameter under constant illuminations appears to be mediated almost exclusively via NE (Koss, ).
20204145:12	While the exact path of innervation is not known, it is believed that NE originating from the lower medullary NE cell groups (Levitt and Moore, ) indirectly stimulates the iris dilator muscles via projections from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (Yoshitomi et al., ). Electrophysiological studies in animals (Rajkowski et al., ; Kalwani and Gold, ) and a recent human fMRI study (Sterpenich et al., ) provide further evidence for a tight association between LC activity and pupillary dilation.
20204145:13	Based on this converging data, we use pupil dilation as a reliable and non-invasive proxy for NE release.
20204145:14	Here, human observers performed two basic tasks.
20204145:15	In one case, participants pressed a button at a freely chosen time point during a 10-s period (experiment 1: “immediate overt response”).
20204145:16	In the second case observers chose a 2-s interval within the same 10-s period, but concealed their choice until the trial's end (experiments 2a,b: “covert digit choice” with and without reward).
20204145:17	In a final condition, the free choice was replaced by an external cue (experiment 3: “instructed pick”).
20204145:18	Using pupil-dilation to predict the timing of button press or the chosen interval allowed us to test the hypothesis that NE plays the same role in consolidating covert cognitive choices as it does in the decision to overtly execute motor acts.
20204145:19	All versions of the task required minimal mental effort over the trial duration.
20204145:20	This simple series of experiments therefore allowed us to identify decision-related pupil responses independent of more general influences of arousal, reward anticipation or task difficulty.
20204145:21	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Observers performed one of three tasks, either pressing a button volitionally once during a 10-s decision period (experiment 1), covertly choosing one out of five digits and reporting it only at the trial's end (experiments 2a,b), or reporting a cued digit at the trial's end (experiment 3).
20204145:22	In all experiments the observer's choice – time of button press or chosen digit – defined the “chosen interval” on which further analysis was based.
20204145:23	Discussion 
Here we show that pupil dilation can betray an individual's decision before it is openly revealed.
20204145:24	Pupil diameter was found to increase at the time of a decision irrespective of whether the choice related to the voluntary execution of a motor act or the selection of a digit from a series of five numbers.
20204145:25	In experiment 2 we disentangled the effect of the decision to act and the action itself by enforcing a delay between the two.
20204145:26	Using the five digits as a “clock” we nonetheless gained access to the approximate timing of the covert decision.
20204145:27	While the magnitude of responses were reduced in the covert tasks, the same overall pattern of results was observed for the covert cognitive decision as was seen in the execution of the overt motor act.
20204145:28	This finding extends the proposed role of NE in behavioral decisions (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ).
20204145:29	Our results suggest that NE may serve the same function in situations requiring a purely cognitive decision (in this case the selection of an arbitrary digit symbol).
20204145:30	This finding suggests that the applicability of these models may be extended from behavior to cognition, as in both cases, NE may help to rapidly consolidate the chosen selection.
20204145:31	Taken together with the recent proposal that NE consolidates perceptual interpretations of ambiguous signals (Einhäuser et al., ), we suggest a generic consolidating function of NE for situations of high uncertainty – in perception, cognition and behavior.
20204145:32	The time-locked pupil response observed in the current studies appears reminiscent of decades old research showing pupil dilation during tasks involving cognitive (Kahneman and Beatty, ; Beatty and Lucero-Wagoner, ) and attentional effort (Bradshaw, ) or periods of emotional arousal (Sterpenich et al., ).
20204145:33	From inspection of the top panel of Figure it can be seen that the mean response (indicated by the black line) plateaus towards the middle of the trial.
20204145:34	This general, and quickly saturating, increase of average pupil dilation during a decision period closely matches earlier data.
20204145:35	Simpson and Hale obtained results similar to the mean trace seen here, when they asked observers to decide, during a 7-s decision period, whether to press one of two levers directly after the completion of the decision period.
20204145:36	Using an additional no-decision control, these authors convincingly showed that the bulk of the increase in pupil diameter is linked to the decision process itself.
20204145:37	Their paradigm lacked, however, any possibility to narrow down the time-point of the actual decision further.
20204145:38	Here, in contrast, we could demonstrate that the pupil response is specific to the particular choice (for example, the top panel of Figure when the subject responds in the initial 2-s epoch), peaks during the corresponding time period and then subsequently decreases.
20204145:39	Given that NE, and the associated pupil response, is inextricably linked to general levels of arousal it is important to disentangle our claim of decision-specific effects of NE from these more generic examples of heightened arousal.
20204145:40	Since the initial version of the covert choice task involved a reward payout at the end of each trial (experiment 2a) and it is known that reward expectancy leads to increased arousal (for review see Wise, ; Weinshenker and Schroeder, ), it may have been possible that our pupil dilation response reflected the subjects’ anticipation of the upcoming results.
20204145:41	In order to explore this effect directly, we conducted a second version of the task without any reward or feedback (experiment 2b).
20204145:42	In the absence of reward the same, though weaker, overall pattern was observed in both the group (Figure L) and the individual data in all but one observer (Figure P).
20204145:43	In the instructed pick condition of experiment 3, we actually see stronger pupil responses compared to experiment 2a, despite the absence of reward in this condition as well.
20204145:44	Together, these results show that reward anticipation is unlikely to explain the observed pupil dilation.
20204145:45	We do not deny, however, that reward anticipation is likely to engage the same noradrenergic network and may underlie some proportion of the pupil response observed in the rewarded conditions (experiments 1 and 2a).
20204145:46	The fact that the digit sequence always consisted of 5 digits randomly selected from a possible 10 digits together with the analysis of choice patterns, makes it unlikely that subjects pre-selected their favorite number and then became aroused or excited when the digit was presented on the screen.
20204145:47	Finally, as the cognitive load is minimal, and identical across the duration of all trials, it is difficult to see how the pupil dilation could result from a temporary increase in cognitive or attentional demand associated with the task.
20204145:48	For these reasons, we are confident that our result does not merely reflect general changes in reward-based arousal, mental effort or cognitive demand.
20204145:49	However, we do not dispute the obviously close links between arousal and NE.
20204145:50	Indeed, we believe that transient increases in arousal may play a central role in consolidating a decision by increasing the perceived salience of the winning selection and directing the individual's attention away from the competing alternatives.
20204145:51	Our results are thus consistent with the proposed role of NE in temporarily facilitating the neural networks supporting the winning selection (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ) and show that this facilitation is irrespective of whether the decision is between abstract digit symbols or available motor contingencies.
20204145:52	Importantly, our results from the instructed pick condition (experiment 3) are consistent with the proposed role of NE in the consolidation component of the decision, rather than the preceding appraisal component.
20204145:53	Independent of the neural mechanisms underlying our results, there are a number of important implications arising from the fact that we used pupil responses to predict an individual's decision before it was revealed.
20204145:54	Unlike previous reports of “mind reading” based on changes in the brain's electrical or metabolic activity recorded using cumbersome equipment such as electroencephalography (EEG) (Libet et al., ) or fMRI (Soon et al., ) here we instead used a measure that is accessible to the naked eye and thus of potential relevance in social interactions.
20204145:55	Arguably the best-known example for usage of pupil dilation as a social cue, is the fact that the natural source of pupil-dilating atropine is the plant commonly named “bella donna” (beautiful woman).
20204145:56	Indeed, the pupil size in images of faces modulates several emotional judgments, brain activation as well as the observer's own pupil dilation (Harrison et al., ).
20204145:57	It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that the use of pupil dilation to provide insights into a competitor's strategic decision making processes may be one reason poker players like wearing sunglasses.
20204145:58	One further implication of our study is that pupil dilation may provide a means of assessing mental function and communicating with non-responsive patients in a vegetative state or suffering from locked-in syndrome (Owen et al., ). While the pupil responses observed were relatively small, for such applications, prediction performance could likely be improved further if inter-observer variability in the pupil response was accounted for, and – instead of using the same marker ( t max) for all observers – the system was trained for each individual to exploit idiosyncratic features of the pupil response function.
20204145:59	Even if pupil dilation may never provide sufficient single trial reliability for complex communication it could nevertheless provide a measure of mental function.
20204145:60	Given the accessibility of the signal, pupil dilation could thus complement the use of functional brain imaging methods currently being explored, which are similarly reliant on statistical inference.
20204145:61	In summary, the time locking of pupil dilation with cognitive decisions, provides evidence for the same involvement of NE in optimal cognitive performance as has previously been suggested for behavior (Aston-Jones and Cohen, ; Bouret and Sara, ).
20204145:62	However, while there are converging links between pupil dilation and NE release (Rajkowski et al., ; Sterpenich et al., ; Kalwani and Gold, ; Gilzenrat et al., ) direct physiological measurements of LC-NE activity in our task are needed to firmly establish this conclusion.
20204145:63	Independent of the physiological basis, however, we have for the first time demonstrated the prediction of seemingly private decisions by a measure accessible to the naked eye.

19468332:0	Introduction 
The benzimidazoles are a large chemical family used as antimicrobial agents against the wide spectrum of microorganisms  . Because of its synthetic utility and broad range of pharmacological effects, the benzimidazole nucleus is an important heterocyclic ring, and interest in the chemistry, synthesis and microbiology of this pharmacophore continues to be fuelled by its antifungal , antitubercular , antioxidant , and antiallergic  properties.
19468332:1	Other reports have revealed that these molecules are also present in a variety of antiparasitic  and herbicidal agents . Albendazole, fenbendazole and their sulphoxide derivatives are methylcarbamate benzimidazoles with a broad spectrum anthelmintic activity, widely used in human and veterinary medicine . They are used against several systemic parasitoses, including nematodoses, hidatidosis, teniasis and others . They are also used to treat microsporodial and cryptosporodial infections, which can cause lethal diarrhea in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs, or infected with HIV . 
Different substituted benzimidazolyl quinolinyl mercaptotriazoles are remarkably effective compounds both with respect to their virus inhibitory activity and their favourable antibacterial activity . In recent years, benzimidazole derivatives have been attracted particular interest due to their antiviral activity against HCV (Hepatitis C virus) .
19468332:2	Although a variety of benzimidazole derivatives are known, the development of new and convenient strategies to synthesize new biologically active benzimidazoles is of considerable interest.
19468332:3	Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies are useful tools in the rational search for bioactive molecules.
19468332:4	The main success of the QSAR method is the possibility to estimate the characteristics of new chemical compounds without the need to synthesize and test them.
19468332:5	This analysis represents an attempt to relate structural descriptors of compounds with their physicochemical properties and biological activities.
19468332:6	This is widely used for the prediction of physicochemical properties in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and environmental spheres.
19468332:7	This method included data collection, molecular descriptor selection, correlation model development, and finally model evaluation.
19468332:8	QSAR studies have predictive ability and simultaneously provide deeper insight into mechanism of drug receptor interactions . 
In view of the above and in continuation of our studies on the inhibitory activities of benzimidazole derivatives, as well as on correlation of molecular properties with activity [ – – ], the objective of this investigation was to study the usefulness of QSAR in the prediction of the antibacterial activity of benzimidazole derivatives against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been developed as a mathematical equation which can relate chemical structure to the inhibitory activity.
19468332:9	Results and Discussion 
In the first step of the present study, different substituted benzimidazoles were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The inhibitory effects of compounds 1 – 14 expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, are summarized in .
19468332:10	The screening results reveal that all the compounds exhibited appreciable in vitro activity against the tested strain.
19468332:11	In the second step, we focused our efforts on developing the QSAR models of compounds 1 – 14 as antibacterial agents.
19468332:12	A set of benzimidazoles was used for MLR model generation.
19468332:13	The reference drugs were not included in model generation as they belong to a different structural series.
19468332:14	Inhibitory activity data determined as μg/mL were first transformed to the negative logarithms of molar MICs (log1/ c MIC), which was used as a dependent variable in the QSAR study.
19468332:15	Different physicochemical, steric, electronic, and structural molecular descriptors were used as independent variables and were correlated with antibacterial activity.
19468332:16	Developing a QSAR model requires a diverse set of data, and, thereby a large number of descriptors have to be considered.
19468332:17	Descriptors are numerical values that encode different structural features of the molecules.
19468332:18	Selection of a set of appropriate descriptors from a large number of them requires a method, which is able to discriminate between the parameters.
19468332:19	Pearson's correlation matrix has been performed on all descriptors by using NCSS Statistical Software.
19468332:20	The analysis of the matrix revealed nine descriptors for the development of MLR model.
19468332:21	The values of descriptors selected for MLR model are presented in . Linear models were then formed by a stepwise addition of terms.
19468332:22	A delition process was then employed, whereby each variable in the model was held out in turn and using the remaining parameters models were generated.
19468332:23	Each descriptor was chosen as input for the statistical software package and then the stepwise addition method implemented in the software was used for choosing the descriptors contributing to the antibacterial activity of benzimidazole derivatives.
19468332:24	The specifications for the best-selected MLR models are shown in .
19468332:25	The monoparametric model indicated the importance of molar weight ( MW ) in contribution to inhibitory activity (model 1, ).
19468332:26	Addition of total energy ( TE ) as an additional parameter to MW significantly increased the correlation coefficient from 0.7910 to 0.8587 (model 2, ).
19468332:27	Similarly, the addition of a third parameter also increased the correlation coefficient, but a MLR method only can be used when a relatively small number of molecular descriptors are used (at least five to six times smaller than the total number of compounds).
19468332:28	In this case (for fourteen compounds), only two descriptors can be used to develop a good QSAR model in order to avoid a high chance of spurious correlations.
19468332:29	In this approach, only the QSAR models 1 and 2 can be considered.
19468332:30	It is well known that there are three important components in any QSAR study: development of models, validation of models and utility of developed models.
19468332:31	Validation is a crucial aspect of any QSAR analysis .
19468332:32	The statistical quality of the resulting models, as depicted in is determined by r s and F  .
19468332:33	It is noteworthy that all these equations were derived using the entire data set of compounds ( n = 14) and no outliers were identified.
19468332:34	The F -value presented in is found statistically significant at 99% level since all the calculated F values are higher as compared to tabulated values.
19468332:35	For the testing the validity of the predictive power of selected MLR models the LOO technique was used.
19468332:36	The developed models were validated by the calculation of following statistical parameters: PRESS, SSY, S PRESS, r 2 CV, and r 2 adj.
19468332:37	These parameters were calculated from the following equations:
 
 
 
 
 where, Y obs, Y calc and Y mean are observed, calculated and mean values; n number of compounds; p number of independent parameters.
19468332:38	PRESS is an acronym for prediction sum of squares.
19468332:39	It is used to validate a regression model with regards to predictability.
19468332:40	To calculate PRESS, each observation is individually omitted.
19468332:41	The remaining n – 1 observations are used to calculate a regression and estimate the value of the omitted observation.
19468332:42	This is done n times, once for each observation.
19468332:43	The difference between the actual Y value, y obs, and the predicted Y, y calc, is called the prediction error.
19468332:44	The sum of the squared prediction errors is the PRESS value.
19468332:45	The smaller PRESS is, the better the predictability of the model.
19468332:46	Its value being less than SSY points out that the model predicts better than chance and can be considered statistically significant.
19468332:47	SSY are the sums of squares associated with the corresponding sources of variation.
19468332:48	These values are in terms of the dependent variable, y.
19468332:49	The PRESS value above can be used to compute an r 2 CV statistic, called r 2 cross validated, which reflects the prediction ability of the model.
19468332:50	This is a good way to validate the prediction of a regression model without selecting another sample or splitting your data.
19468332:51	It is very possible to have a high r 2 and a very low r 2 CV.
19468332:52	When this occurs, it implies that the fitted model is data dependent.
19468332:53	This r 2 CV ranges from below zero to above one.
19468332:54	When outside the range of zero to one, it is truncated to stay within this range.
19468332:55	Adjusted r -squared ( r 2 adj) is an adjusted version of r 2.
19468332:56	The adjustment seeks to remove the distortion due to a small sample size.
19468332:57	In many cases r 2 CV and r 2 adj is taken as a proof of the high predictive ability of QSAR models.
19468332:58	A high value of these statistical characteristic (> 0.5) is considered as a proof of the high predictive ability of the model, although recent reports have proven the opposite .
19468332:59	Although a low value of r 2 CV for the training set can indeed serve as an indicator of a low predictive ability of a model, the opposite is not necessarily true.
19468332:60	Indeed, the high r 2 CV does not imply automatically a high predictive ability of the model.
19468332:61	Thus, the high value of LOO r 2 CV is the necessary condition for a model to have a high predictive power, it is not a sufficient condition.
19468332:62	It is proven that the only way to estimate the true predictive power of a model is to test it on a sufficiently large collection of compounds from an external test set.
19468332:63	The test set must include no less than five compounds, whose activities and structures must cover the range of activities and structures of compounds from the training set.
19468332:64	This application is necessary for obtaining trustful statistics for comparison between the observed and predicted activities for these compounds.
19468332:65	Besides high r 2 CV, a reliable model should be also characterized by a high correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed activities of compounds from a test set of molecules that was not used to develop the models.
19468332:66	To confirm the predictive power of the QSAR models, an external set of benzimidazoles was used.
19468332:67	Five benzimidazole derivatives which were tested in our previous paper for their antibacterial activity against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as the external set of molecules . In the present paper, the inhibitory activity of the following compounds was calculated: 1-(3-methoxybenzyl)-5,6- dimethylbenzimidazole ( 15 ), 1-(3-methylbenzyl)-2-aminobenzimidazole ( 16 ), 1-(3-chlorobenzyl)-2- amino-benzimidazole ( 17 ), 1-(3-fluorobenzyl)-2-amino-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ( 18 ) and 1-(3- methoxybenzyl)-2-amino-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ( 19 ).
19468332:68	The values of inhibitory activitiy of a test set of molecules was calculated with the models 1 and 2.
19468332:69	These data are compared with experimentally obtained values of antibacterial activity against the same bacteria.
19468332:70	From the data presented in it is shown that high agreement between experimental and predicted inhibitory values was obtained (the residual values are small, indicating the good predictability of the established models.
19468332:71	According to the reference , without the validation of the QSAR models by using the external test set, we could not have come to a right conclusion about high predictive ability of derived models.
19468332:72	shows the plots of linear regression predicted versus experimental values of the antibacterial activity of external set of benzimidazoles.
19468332:73	The plots for QSAR models 1 and 2 show a very good fit with r 2 = 0.9992 and 0.9989, respectively.
19468332:74	It indicates that models 1 and 2 can be successfully applied to predict the antibacterial activity of these class of molecules.
19468332:75	Moreover, it is not possible to use the reported QSAR models to predict the activity of any type of molecules vs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
19468332:76	The applicability domain of the derived QSAR models is the different substituted 1-benzyl or 1-benzoylbenzimidazole derivatives.
19468332:77	However, it is very important to point out an eventual QSAR models disappointments: activity cliffs .
19468332:78	It is possible because similar molecules can show significantly different biological activities.
19468332:79	For these molecules, activities are often mispredicted, even when the overall predictivity of the models are high.
19468332:80	Comparing the activities of the tested molecules it was found that 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives (compounds 1 – 7 ) were more active than 2-methylbenzimidazoles (compounds 8 – 14 ).
19468332:81	It can be concluded that the presence of an amino substituent leads to an increase in the activity, in comparison to the presence of a methyl group.
19468332:82	Also, the analysis of the results indicates that the activity increased in the series of compounds 2 – 3 – 4; 5 – 6 – 7; 9 – 10 – 11 and 12 – 13 – 14 .
19468332:83	These observations revealed that the nature of the substituents has an effect on inhibitory activity.
19468332:84	It can be concluded that the presence of substituents (CH 3 or Cl) enhanced the activity of the compounds 2 5 9 and 12 .
19468332:85	However, the presence of a chloro substituent leads to increase in the activity in comparison to the presence of a methyl group.
19468332:86	The comparison between antibacterial activity of 1-benzyl and 1-benzoylbenzimidazole derivatives showed that they were similar, except in the cases of compounds 2 vs . 5 and 9 vs . 12 where the presence of carbonyl group leads to decrease in the activity.
19468332:87	Conclusions 
From the results and discussion presented above, we conclude that the 2-amino- and 2- methylbenzimidazole derivatives are effective in vitro against the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The results obtained from present investigation of antibacterial activity studies indicate that the presence of an amino substituent leads to increase in the activity in comparison to the presence of a methyl group.
19468332:88	QSAR analysis have been used to study the quantitative effects of the molecular structure of the benzimidazoles on their inhibitory activity.
19468332:89	Accurate mathematical models were developed for predicting the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds.
19468332:90	The validity of the models have been established by the determination of suitable statistical parameters.
19468332:91	From the established QSAR models, it was calculated inhibitory activity of the external set of benzimidazoles and close agreement between experimental and predicted values was obtained.
19468332:92	The low residual activity and high cross-validated r 2 values ( r 2 CV) observed indicated the predictive ability of the developed QSAR models.
20628060:0	Introduction 
DNA damage occurs in the cell by an array of genotoxic agents, both endogenous and exogenous.
20628060:1	The effect of DNA damage on basic housekeeping functions of the cell depends on the nature of the lesion.
20628060:2	Eukaryotic cells remove DNA lesions through two major pathways: nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair (BER).
20628060:3	Nucleotide excision repair is responsible for the removal of bulky lesions in DNA, whereas BER removes primarily small, non-helix-distorting lesions.
20628060:4	Large bulky adducts between adjoining nucleotides have been shown to physically block access of proteins necessary for cellular maintenance such as replication and transcription.
20628060:5	Indeed, we have previously shown that binding of transcription factor IIIA to the 5 S rRNA gene decreases the rate of repair of UV radiation-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in the internal control region.
20628060:6	Furthermore, introduction of single cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesions at six different sites in the internal control region of 5 S rDNA allowed us to map the binding strength of transcription factor IIIA to its cognate sequence.
20628060:7	Although overall binding was unaltered, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer damage at certain sites increased the dissociation rate of transcription factor IIIA by up to 4-fold.
20628060:8	Moreover, the higher off rate correlated with an increased repair rate, suggesting that the rate of DNA damage recognition is determined, in part, by existing protein·DNA complexes.
20628060:9	Base excision repair is responsible for the repair of DNA lesions that result from modification of the nitrogenous bases.
20628060:10	These lesions are caused by a variety of sources, including exogenous agents like alkylating chemicals and endogenous events like replication errors and oxidative damage.
20628060:11	In eukaryotic cells, damaged bases are recognized and removed by specialized enzymes, collectively known as DNA glycosylases.
20628060:12	Each glycosylase recognizes one or more specific lesions and removes the damaged base.
20628060:13	Furthermore, the glycosylase serves to protect the abasic site by possessing a higher binding affinity for abasic sites than the original damaged base.
20628060:14	Subsequent steps in the BER pathway are believed to proceed in a measured and orderly fashion that has been likened to the “passing of a baton”.
20628060:15	Endonuclease Ape1 is the second enzyme recruited to the damage site, displacing the glycosylase and creating a single strand nick in the DNA 5′ to the damaged base.
20628060:16	At this point, BER can proceed down one of two pathways: long patch repair (2–10-nucleotide replacement) or DNA polymerase β (pol β)-dependent short patch repair (one-nucleotide replacement).
20628060:17	During short patch repair, pol β displaces Ape1, removes the deoxyribose sugar, and uses the complementary base as a template to insert the correct nucleotide.
20628060:18	Finally, DNA ligase I seals the nick.
20628060:19	Similar to examples involving bulky adducts, the binding and affinity of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors are sometimes altered when the regulatory element contains oxidative damage.
20628060:20	In addition, these protein-DNA interactions can block access of repair proteins to DNA lesions.
20628060:21	Indeed, we demonstrated that the activity of pol β is completely suppressed when damaged DNA is associated with a nucleosome.
20628060:22	This is most likely due to the prevention of significant DNA bending by the DNA·histone complex, which is a requirement for pol β function.
20628060:23	Thus, protein interactions with damaged DNA can affect the recognition and subsequent repair of DNA.
20628060:24	In this study, we examined BER in a DNA·protein complex where the protein binds just one side of the DNA helix.
20628060:25	We used the well characterized glucocorticoid receptor and its cognate sequence, the glucocorticoid response element (GRE), to test the activity of BER enzymes UDG, Ape1, pol β, and DNA ligase I on uracil residues located within (or just outside) a GRE.
20628060:26	We showed that the impact of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain (GR-DBD) binding on opposite sides of the DNA helix from uracil yields both negative and positive effects on the UDG/Ape1 and pol β steps, respectively.
20628060:27	EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
Upon binding of ligand, the GR translocates into the nucleus where it binds to its cognate sequence, the GRE.
20628060:28	Although there is evidence that the receptor can dimerize before it interacts with DNA, recognition of the GRE by the GR-DBD has been shown to be cooperative, and binding to the low affinity half-site is dependent on the high affinity site being bound.
20628060:29	The GR-DBD contains five residues that are required for receptor dimerization and behaves similarly to the intact protein, making it ideal for studying GR interactions with DNA.
20628060:30	Based on the crystal structure of GR-DBD, the damaged nucleotides used in this study do not have specific contacts with the GR-DBD protein.
20628060:31	In support of this, we saw no effect of U→C substitution on the ability of GR-DBD to bind to the GRE.
20628060:32	Using EMSA and methylation protection assays, we found that GR-DBD bound to dU-damaged DNA with the same affinity as to undamaged DNA.
20628060:33	Based on their crystal structures, both UDG and Ape1 bind one surface (or side) of the DNA molecule.
20628060:34	However, we found that they were strongly affected by the binding of the GR-DBD on the opposite side of the helix, suggesting that these proteins cannot bind the GRE simultaneously.
20628060:35	In the case of UDG, the higher affinity of GR-DBD (5.7 versus 48 n m for UDG) must create a steric block to the access of the GRE.
20628060:36	In contrast, the binding affinity of Ape1 is significantly higher (0.8 n m K d), but GR-DBD binding appears to dominate.
20628060:37	Thus, competition between GR-DBD and UDG/Ape1 may be the source of slower cleavage.
20628060:38	If competition for GRE binding yields the lag in cleavage activity by UDG/Ape1, there may be a correlation between the affinity of the GR-DBD to each half-site and the amount of interference in the cleavage assay.
20628060:39	Indeed, we found that in the presence of saturating levels of GR-DBD a slightly greater reduction in rate was seen for damage to the higher affinity RH (5- or 13-fold) than to the lower affinity LH (3.8- or 10-fold) regardless of the UDG source ( or human, respectively).
20628060:40	Furthermore, the strongest effect by GR-DBD binding is within the confines of the 15-nucleotide GRE as little difference was seen in cleavage on substrates containing damage just outside this region.
20628060:41	The slight decrease seen in DS19 may reflect a change in DNA secondary structure at this site upon GR-DBD binding or nonspecific binding by GR-DBD.
20628060:42	(We note that nonspecific binding of GR-DBD is salt-dependent, being partially alleviated at concentrations above 70 m m salt, and the total salt concentration in the GR-DBD binding buffer used was 72.5 m m.) 
We and others have shown that the activity of pol β is suppressed or inhibited when DNA is in a nucleosome.
20628060:43	The co-crystal structure of pol β shows that protein-DNA contacts are extensive, and binding results in an ∼90° kink in the DNA.
20628060:44	Therefore, because DNA wrapped around the histone octamer has reduced torsional flexibility, it is not surprising that pol β function is impeded.
20628060:45	Here we used naked DNA ± GR-DBD to examine whether a regulatory protein interferes with pol β activity similarly to the histone octamer.
20628060:46	Indeed, based on the reduced rate of cleavage by UDG/Ape1 seen with substrates containing damage in the GRE, we expected a similar trend for pol β.
20628060:47	In contrast to our results with nucleosomes, however, we were surprised to see no reduction in pol β activity in the presence of GR-DBD.
20628060:48	Furthermore, there was a small enhancement in activity on substrates RH and DS6.
20628060:49	If the damaged site is directly “handed to” pol β by Ape1 then this precludes the ability of GR-DBD to physically interfere with this process, and pol β activity would proceed unheeded.
20628060:50	As for the slight enhancement, the intrinsic properties of the DNA fragment that are changed by GR-DBD binding ( e.g. the predicted 35° bend in the helical axis) may enhance pol β activity.
20628060:51	Solution structure data of the GR-DBD·GRE complex shows that amino acids 510–517 of the GR-DBD induce DNA bending and unwinding, events that might position the abasic site for an easier access by pol β.
20628060:52	If so, this could explain the enhancement seen only within the closest proximity to GR-DBD binding.
20628060:53	DNA ligase I has been shown to form a complex with pol β both in vivo and in vitro, forming a multiprotein complex that is responsible for sealing the nick after repair of a damaged nucleotide.
20628060:54	This close association presumably results in the priority of DNA ligase I activity over any interference with GR-DBD.
20628060:55	After the reduced rate seen at the initial BER steps, it appears that subsequent steps are much less affected by the presence of GR-DBD.
20628060:56	Interestingly, the slight enhancement seen for pol β did not correlate with DNA ligase I activity.
20628060:57	Comparison of the results for UDG/Ape1 cleavage and pol β incorporation allows one to examine the relationship between the location of damage and the effect on the different enzyme activities.
20628060:58	UDG/Ape1 cleavage is greatly reduced within the GRE, whereas in contrast these sites yield unaltered or increased pol β activity.
20628060:59	This suggests a complex interplay between the proteins as they compete for access to the substrate.
20628060:60	The sequence of events, including the order and duration of protein binding, depends upon the binding affinity of each protein.
20628060:61	Initially, we predicted that GR-DBD would physically block access of the repair proteins to the damaged nucleotide.
20628060:62	Although this occurred for UDG/Ape1, it was not the case for pol β or DNA ligase I.
20628060:63	Importantly, the GR-DBD complex did not create the same block to BER enzymes as the histone octamer.
20628060:64	Our results indicate that the ability of BER proteins to access damaged nucleotides is highly dependent on the DNA-protein interactions in place around the damage site.
20628060:65	Clearly, it will be of interest to compare the repair efficiency and mutation rates within different locations of chromatin of intact cells and under different regulatory conditions.

20596496:0	Introduction 
Since its discovery in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great research interests due to its unique one-dimensional structure and outstanding properties . A large amount of research has been conducted to explore both the fundamental properties   and application potentials for CNTs.
20596496:1	In terms of applications, high-performance CNT-based field-effect transistors , solar cells , hazard gas detector , and DNA sensors  have been widely reported.
20596496:2	It is also found that CNTs have excellent field emission properties .
20596496:3	With significant advantages over their traditional counterpart, CNTs are generally believed to be an ideal building block for the next generation electronics, optoelectronics, and high-performance sensors.
20596496:4	However, the selectable and controllable placement and patterning of this nano-scale material has remained a challenge for their practical application.
20596496:5	Common techniques to form aligned nanostructures include microwave plasma CVD , phase transformation , thermal oxidation , and electroless deposition . Recently, researchers have shown that dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an efficient technique to manipulate carbon nanotubes .
20596496:6	With no functionalization, DEP has the potential of separating metallic-single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and semiconducting-SWCNTs , aligning carbon nanotubes between microelectrodes , and realizing large-scale manipulation . Both experimental and theoretical work are conducted, most studies focus on the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of CNTs , and the translation and rotation of CNTs under electrical field .
20596496:7	However, the mechanisms for controllable patterning of CNTs between electrodes are not fully understood.
20596496:8	Here, the assembly of SWCNTs between electrodes is analyzed with the electrophoresis model.
20596496:9	The influences of various factors including the electrode type, DEP voltage and thermal noise on the DEP assembly are taken into consideration.
20596496:10	Besides, the influence of already deposited SWCNTs on the alignment of succeeding ones is also studied.
20596496:11	Theory 
We model single carbon nanotube bundles as prolate ellipsoid with a  = 500 nm, b  =  c  = 10 nm.
20596496:12	Its movement in suspending medium is governed by Langevin equation : where m is the mass of bundle, F the external force, and f the friction factor related to IPA’s viscosity η by  In our modeling, F consists of two components: one is the deterministic DEP force due to electrical field generated by the electrodes; while the other is the random force induced by thermal noise in the surrounding medium.
20596496:13	The latter leads to the well-known Brownian motion of microparticles.
20596496:14	Simulation 
We use commercial finite-element software ANSYS 10.0 multiphysics  to solve the Poisson’s equation for (a) parallel electrode and (b) comb electrode, as shown in Fig.
20596496:15	. The results are exported to Matlab for further processing.
20596496:16	The distance between electrode pairs are both 1 μm, comparable to the length of SWCNT-bundle.
20596496:17	The solution volume for the above two electrode structure are 9 × 6× 10 μm 3 and 5 × 6× 10 μm 3, respectively, the distance between neighboring grid point is 0.05 μm, which is precise enough for our simulation.
20596496:18	Using Eq.  we can get the DEP force at every grid point.
20596496:19	The movement of SWCNT-bundles is divided into a series of steps.
20596496:20	For every time step, the terminal velocity is evaluated by Eq.
20596496:21	. To avoid numerical errors, the time step is adjusted to make the space step constant, which means near regions with high field strength, the time step is effectively reduced.
20596496:22	In our simulation, this time step is well above the characteristic time ∝, so the use of Eq.  is justified.
20596496:23	To account for Brownian motion, we superpose the Brownian displacement given by Eq.  at every step.
20596496:24	To get the final SWCNT-bundles’ space distribution on the electrode, we initiate 1,000 randomly distributed SWCNT-bundles in the solution, and trace the movement of every bundle until it reaches the substrate.
20596496:25	Considering the relatively low CNTs’ density in medium solution (in the order of μg/l in device applications), we neglect the interaction between SWCNT-bundles when they are suspended in the medium.
20596496:26	However, once a bundle first attach to the electrode, it may severely alter the local electrical field structure.
20596496:27	Thus, change the DEP movement of latter bundles.
20596496:28	We numerically demonstrate this effect by solving the Poisson’s equation with one SWCNT-bundle bridge the electrode (Fig.  c, d) and then use this field solution to simulate the subsequent SWCNT-bundles’ DEP process.
20596496:29	Result and Discussion 
The simulated electrical field strength E 2 for parallel and comb electrode is shown in Fig.
20596496:30	. According to DEP theory for SWCNT-bundles, is proportional to the gradient of E 2, so SWCNT-bundles will move toward the region with the highest field strength (the red zone in Fig.
20596496:31	).
20596496:32	Right above the surface of substrate ( z  = 0.2 μm), the highest electrical field appears at the edge of the electrode.
20596496:33	A little higher ( z  = 0.5 μm), the highest field appears in the middle of the gap.
20596496:34	Comparing Fig.  a with b, we observe that comb electrode generates field map similar to its geometry structure.
20596496:35	However, it is only for plane sufficient near the surface ( z  = 0.2 μm, which is comparable to the distance between neighboring finger tips).
20596496:36	For the plane at z  = 0.5 μm, comb electrode generate electrical field just like parallel electrode.
20596496:37	Because of its subtle electrical field structure, comb electrode provides possibilities to align SWCNT-bundles to desire cites on substrate.
20596496:38	As shown in Fig.
20596496:39	b, near the surface, the field varies periodically in the y -direction.
20596496:40	Correspondingly, the SWCNT-bundles are supposed to assemble into array form with the same period.
20596496:41	We simulate the distribution of 1,000 SWCNT-bundles after DEP for both parallel and comb electrode.
20596496:42	As shown in Fig.
20596496:43	this distribution perfectly reflects the field structure generated by the electrode.
20596496:44	For parallel structure, almost all the bundles locate in the gap between the two adjacent electrodes, and it is uniformly distributed.
20596496:45	This indicates that parallel electrode is efficient to capture SWCNT-bundles.
20596496:46	When the length of bundle is larger than the width of the gap (1 μm in Fig.
20596496:47	a), there is a high ratio of SWCNT-bundles bridged the electrode, which is desired in electrical characterization and device fabrication.
20596496:48	In fact, there are reports using parallel electrode DEP to construct CNT-based field-effect transistors, thin film transistors and solar cells.
20596496:49	However, because of the random distribution of SWCNT-bundles, the parallel electrode is not a good choice to construct large number of devices based on single bundle of SWCNTs.
20596496:50	Comb electrode, as shown in Fig.
20596496:51	b, can assemble SWCNT-bundles into array structure.
20596496:52	The SWCNT-bundles are collected in the region between countering fingertips because of its higher local field strength.
20596496:53	In our simulation, the distance between neighboring fingers is 0.3  μm and the distribution of SWCNT-bundles basically has the same period.
20596496:54	Confirmed by previous experiments , our simulation indicates that comb electrode has the potential to realize large-scale assembly of SWCNT devices.
20596496:55	When suspended in the solution medium, the interaction between SWCNT-bundles can be neglected because of relatively low density (in the order of μg/l).
20596496:56	On the other hand, when the interaction between two SWCNT-bundles are taken into account, we are actually dealing with the interaction between the two dipole moments and For one SWCNT-bundle, the interaction force is due to the field created by the dipole moment of another SWCNT-bundle.
20596496:57	This interaction force can be expressed as where is the field created by dipole moment So generally, this interaction force is a secondary effect, and will not influence the DEP movement due to the fact that the DEP force produced by external field dominates.
20596496:58	The case that the interaction between SWCNT-bundles will play a main role is when the external field is uniform, in which and there is no DEP movement.
20596496:59	In our simulation, the use of microelectrodes will cause the generation of strong non-uniform electrical fields.
20596496:60	So, the interaction between SWCNT-bundles will not change the results of our simulation.
20596496:61	Whenever one single bundle bridges the electrode, it can greatly change the local electrical field structure.
20596496:62	The mechanism can be explained as follows: When no SWCNT-bundle bridges the electrodes, the voltage drop exists across the gap of the electrode pairs.
20596496:63	After a SWCNT-bundle bridges the electrodes, the contact resistance of metal–nanotube junction plays a dominant role and absorbs most of the voltage drop . As a result, the main body of SWCNT-bundle is nearly equipotential.
20596496:64	Therefore, when the SWCNT-bundle bridges the electrodes, the local potential distribution is changed, thereby changing the local electrical field.
20596496:65	We numerically demonstrate this effect by simulate the electrical field structure for both parallel and comb electrode when one SWCNT-bundle bridged the electrodes.
20596496:66	As shown in Fig.
20596496:67	for both parallel and comb electrode structure, the highest field region (red zone) is intercepted by the presence of bridged SWCNT-bundle at Y  = 0. Away from the bundle, the field structure remains the same as in Fig.
20596496:68	. Several experiments confirmed this “screen” effect of bridged SWCNT-bundle to latter bundles in DEP process.
20596496:69	For parallel electrode, SWCNT-bundles tend to form dispersively aligned parallel array, with an average distance between neighboring bundles.
20596496:70	While for comb electrode, this effect ensures that for every fingertip electrode pair, there is only one bundle bridged.
20596496:71	The results are consistent with our earlier experimental research .
20596496:72	Using modified electrical field for CNT-bridged electrode, we simulate the corresponding distribution of latter SWCNT-bundles, as shown in Fig.
20596496:73	. For parallel electrode, there is approximately a 0.4-μm (−0.2 μm to +0.2 μm) wide region where there’s almost no SWCNT-bundles landed.
20596496:74	Outside this region, the bundles are uniformly distributed as in Fig.
20596496:75	. For comb electrode, very few bundles land between the fingertip pair at Y  = 0 μm.
20596496:76	The other fingertip pairs are not affected by the “screen effect”, probably because the distance between neighboring pairs (0.3 μm) exceed the “screening length”, which is 0.2 μm in Fig.
20596496:77	a.
20596496:78	The “screening effect” in DEP process makes the controllable patterning of carbon nanotubes possible.
20596496:79	In our simulation, for 1-μm electrode gap and 1-μm long SWCNT-bundle, the screening length is about 0.2 μm.
20596496:80	This provides estimation for the upper limit of the density of DEP patterned carbon nanotubes array.
20596496:81	Because the electrostatics scales with the size of the objects, we can anticipate the shorter screening length if we reduce the gap of electrodes as well as the length of SWCNT-bundles.
20596496:82	That means if we use 100-nm-long SWCNT-bundle and keep the size ratio of all the structures constant, the screening length will be reduced to 20 nm.
20596496:83	Unfortunately, for smaller SWCNT bundles, the influence of the thermal noise increases.
20596496:84	Stronger Brownian motion will disturb the deterministic DEP movement.
20596496:85	We simulate the DEP process for the 100-nm-scale case: the gap of electrodes and the length of SWCNT-bundles are reduced to 100 nm; the size ratio of all structures is kept constant.
20596496:86	The results are shown in Fig.
20596496:87	in which the peak-to-peak voltage ( V ) is 1 V, with the electrical field in the medium kept invariant as that for the 1-μm-scale case.
20596496:88	The movement of SWCNT-bundle is randomized by the thermal noise even if it is very close to the electrode surface.
20596496:89	When V  = 5 V, the DEP force is increased so as to overcome the Brownian motion near the electrode.
20596496:90	The corresponding distribution of SWCNT-bundles for the comb electrode at 100 nm scale is simulated, as shown in Fig.
20596496:91	.
20596496:92	It indicates that when peak-to-peak voltage is 1 V, the thermal noise disarranges the array distribution while the peak-to-peak voltage of 5 V can overcome the influence of thermal noise and retain the array distribution.
20596496:93	Conclusion 
The assembly of SWCNTs on the electrodes using the DEP method has been studied theoretically.
20596496:94	The influences of electrode type, electrode voltage, thermal noise, and as-bridged nanotubes on the results of DEP assembly are analyzed.
20596496:95	The results suggest that: (1) although the parallel and comb electrode are both effective electrode structures to align the SWCNTs, the comb electrode has a better position control of SWCNTs than the parallel electrode; (2) once a SWNCT bundle bridges on the electrode, it will change the local electrical field and “screen off” the SWCNTs that approach later; for parallel electrode this effect results in the formation of dispersed SWCNT array, while for comb electrode it guarantees that one fingertip pair collects only one SWCNT bundle; (3) the density of DEP assembled array is limited by the “screening length”, which scales with the gap width of electrodes and the length of SWCNT bundle; and (4) the thermal noise has an important influence on the DEP assembly of SWCNTs, which is more significant for the smaller electrode structures and shorter SWCNTs; by increasing the AC voltage, this influence can be effectively eliminated.
16669701:0	Introduction 
At least 10% of mammalian genes are transcribed from only one allele that, in most instances, is chosen at random [
				 ].
16669701:1	The mechanisms for achieving differential regulation of homologous alleles in a stochastic manner are poorly understood [
				 ].
16669701:2	X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is an example of random monoallelic expression; the majority of genes on one X chromosome in XX females are silenced to equalize expression of X-linked genes with XY males [
				 ].
16669701:3	Understanding the process by which the two X chromosomes are assigned active and inactive fates in a stochastic manner will provide insight into how randomness can be achieved in other biological contexts.
16669701:4	X-inactivation is a well-defined system for studying the mechanisms that generate the randomness of monoallelic expression.
16669701:5	In the earliest stages of female embryogenesis, X-linked genes exhibit biallelic expression in female cells.
16669701:6	Upon receipt of a developmental cue, one X chromosome is silenced in half of the cells of the embryo and the other X chromosome is silenced in the remaining half.
16669701:7	Once the identities of the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi) are established, they are stably propagated throughout all subsequent cell divisions [
				 ].
16669701:8	Female mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a model system to study the mechanisms that control the initial, stochastic determination of the Xa and Xi in vitro.
16669701:9	As in the pluripotent cells of the early embryo, genes are expressed from both X chromosomes in female ES cells.
16669701:10	X-inactivation can be induced in vitro, recapitulating the random silencing process that occurs in vivo during differentiation [
				 ].
16669701:11	In addition, genetic elements have been identified that affect the randomness of X-inactivation [
				 ,
				 ], making female ES cells a useful tool for the study of the mechanisms that control random monoallelic expression.
16669701:12	The 
				 X-inactivation center (Xic) is a master 
				 cis -regulatory element on the X chromosome that controls X-inactivation [
				 ].
16669701:13	The 
				 Xic contains a number of elements, including 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix, a sense/antisense pair of noncoding RNAs that are transcribed from both X chromosomes prior to X-inactivation [
				 –
				 ].
16669701:14	When embryonic cells differentiate and X-inactivation is initiated, 
				 Xist RNA spreads in 
				 cis from the 
				 Xic to coat and silence one X chromosome [
				 ,
				 ].
16669701:15	Xist and 
				 Tsix play a role in the stochastic determination of which X chromosome will become the Xi and which will become the Xa.
16669701:16	In cells heterozygous for either an 
				 Xist or a 
				 Tsix mutation
				 X-inactivation is nonrandom: an 
				 Xist mutant chromosome always becomes the Xa [
				 ,
				 ] and a 
				 Tsix mutant chromosome always becomes the Xi [
				 –
				 ].
16669701:17	Heterozygous mutations of 
				 Xist or 
				 Tsix also exhibit effects in 
				 trans: not only are the fates of the mutant X chromosomes fixed but also the fates of the wild-type X chromosomes are determined.
16669701:18	Thus, information about the fate of one X chromosome must be transmitted to the other X chromosome, ensuring that decisions about their fates are coordinated and that there is random and exclusive silencing of one X chromosome in female cells.
16669701:19	The manner in which the opposing activities of 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix regulate the fates of both X chromosomes in female cells remains mysterious.
16669701:20	In this paper, we present evidence that in individual pluripotent embryonic cells that are poised for X-inactivation, the X chromosomes exist in two mutually exclusive states.
16669701:21	In heterozygous 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix mutant cells, these states predict the fates of the X chromosomes, indicating that one X chromosome adopts a future Xa state and the other X chromosome adopts a future Xi state.
16669701:22	In wild-type cells, X chromosomes switch between these states such that, among the progeny of a single cell, a given X chromosome exhibits each state with equal frequency.
16669701:23	Thus, the concerted switching of homologous X chromosomes between mutually exclusive future Xa and future Xi states may provide the basis for the apparent randomness of X-inactivation.
16669701:24	Results 
Discussion 
In this study, we used FISH to demonstrate that the two X chromosomes in female mouse ES cells differ prior to X-inactivation.
16669701:25	On one X chromosome, the 
				 Xic tended to appear as a singlet signal when assayed by FISH and other X-linked genes more often appeared as doublets.
16669701:26	The second X chromosome was more likely to show the opposite pattern.
16669701:27	In ES cell lines that are destined for nonrandom X-inactivation, the future Xi exhibited a high frequency of singlet signals for the 
				 Xic and of doublet signals for other X-chromosomal loci, while the future Xa showed the opposite pattern.
16669701:28	Taken together, these data suggest that, prior to X-inactivation, the two X chromosomes in a female cell exist in distinct future Xi and future Xa states.
16669701:29	We propose that an absolute difference between the X chromosomes underlies the future Xi and future Xa states.
16669701:30	The state of the X chromosome in turn affects the probability that a locus will appear as a singlet or doublet FISH signal.
16669701:31	In 
				 Tsix -pA/+ and Δ
				 Xist /+ ES cells, where a given X chromosome will become the Xi in 100% of cells, the 
				 Xic appeared as a singlet on that chromosome in 70% of SD cells.
16669701:32	A simple explanation for this observation is that FISH reflects dynamic behavior of loci, and the future Xi and future Xa differ in their dynamics.
16669701:33	For example, the 
				 Xic may fluctuate between appearing as a singlet or doublet on both the future Xi and the future Xa, appearing more frequently as a singlet on the future Xi and more frequently as a doublet on the future Xa (
				 ).
16669701:34	In this model, the frequency with which a locus on the future Xi or Xa appears as a singlet or doublet in the population, and not its appearance in a single cell at any given point in time, reveals the underlying state of the chromosome.
16669701:35	In cell lines destined for random and completely nonrandom X-inactivation, the frequency with which a given X chromosome adopts the future Xi state correlates with the frequency with which it will be inactivated.
16669701:36	The same relationship was observed in cell lines that will display skewed X-inactivation due to the 
				 Xce effect.
16669701:37	Thus, the 
				 Xce effect is manifested prior to X-inactivation.
16669701:38	This result is consistent with the suggestion that 
				 Xce effect influences the initial assignment of X chromosome fates [
				 ].
16669701:39	Our observation that X chromosomes adopt distinct future Xi and future Xa states suggests that X chromosomes know their fates prior to silencing.
16669701:40	These states exist even in cell lines that will undergo random X-inactivation, raising the question of how randomness is achieved.
16669701:41	In clonal populations of ES cells that will undergo random X-inactivation, a marked X chromosome showed a singlet signal for an X-linked gene in 50% of cells, suggesting that X chromosomes can switch states.
16669701:42	We propose a model in which switching of X chromosomes between mutually exclusive future Xi and future Xa states is the source of the apparent randomness of X-inactivation (
				 A).
16669701:43	In each cell, one X chromosome adopts the future Xi state and the other X chromosome adopts the future Xa state.
16669701:44	When a cell receives the cue to initiate X-inactivation, the chromosome that exists in the future Xi state in that cell will be silenced.
16669701:45	However, as long as that cell remains pluripotent, the states of the chromosomes are not fixed and can switch in a concerted fashion.
16669701:46	Because of this switching, the two X chromosomes each assume the future Xi state in half of the cells in a population.
16669701:47	This randomization of states provides the basis for silencing to occur in an apparently random manner when X-inactivation is triggered.
16669701:48	In this model, the mechanisms that determine the randomness of X-inactivation function prior to the receipt of the differentiation signal that initiates X-inactivation.
16669701:49	In contrast, the prevailing model for randomness of X-inactivation posits that the two X chromosomes are equivalent in pluripotent cells, and that designation of which chromosome will be silenced occurs stochastically upon receipt of the signal that triggers X-inactivation (
				 B) [
				 ,
				 ].
16669701:50	Instead, our data support a model similar to the class of models proposed by Williams and Wu [
				 ], who speculate that a switching-based mechanism, like that regulating mating-type switching in fission yeast, may underlie the randomness of X-inactivation.
16669701:51	X-chromosomal loci exhibited SD signals in a significant fraction of MeOH-fixed and of PFA-fixed ES cells.
16669701:52	In a recent study, Gribnau et al. [
				 ] also observed a high frequency of SD FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci in MeOH-fixed ES cells.
16669701:53	Based on the large fraction of cells exhibiting SD signals, it was suggested that X-linked genes are subject to asynchronous replication in ES cells.
16669701:54	We directly assayed replication timing of two X-chromosomal loci, 
				 Pgk1 and the 
				 Xic, in ES cells.
16669701:55	Each exhibited a single peak of replication.
16669701:56	Cells showing SD FISH signals for the 
				 Xic or 
				 Pgk1 occurred at a high frequency even after both alleles of these two X-chromosomal loci had replicated.
16669701:57	In addition, a FISH signal intensity quantification assay revealed that in individual ES cells, the singlet and doublet signals for the 
				 Xic or for 
				 Pgk1 contained comparable amounts of DNA.
16669701:58	Together, these data indicate that the high frequency of SD FISH signals for X-chromosomal loci in ES cells is not due to highly asynchronous DNA replication (
				 ).
16669701:59	In PFA-fixed ES cells, the 
				 Xic was unusual in that it tended to exhibit a singlet FISH signal while other genes on the same X chromosome more often showed doublet signals.
16669701:60	In contrast, the 
				 Xic and adjacent genes exhibited concordant FISH signals when ES cells were fixed with MeOH (
				 A) [
				 ].
16669701:61	Thus, the opposite behavior of the 
				 Xic was observed only in PFA-fixed ES cells.
16669701:62	In addition, when ES cells were fixed with PFA, the future Xi showed a higher frequency of singlet signals for the 
				 Xic or of doublet signals for other X-linked genes.
16669701:63	In contrast, when ES cells were fixed with MeOH, the future Xi and future Xa showed equal probabilities of exhibiting singlet signals for the 
				 Xic or other X-linked genes (
				 B) [
				 ].
16669701:64	PFA fixation maintains nuclear structure while MeOH extracts histones and other chromatin proteins and perturbs nuclear organization [
				 ].
16669701:65	Therefore, the differences between PFA- and MeOH-fixed samples suggest that some aspect of chromatin structure or nuclear organization is required for replicated alleles on the future Xi and future Xa to appear as singlets with different probabilities.
16669701:66	One possible explanation is that there is differential cohesion between sister chromatids on the two X chromosomes.
16669701:67	Whatever the physical basis of the singlet and doublet FISH signals, they demonstrate that the X chromosomes differ prior to X-inactivation in a manner that is predictive of Xi and Xa fates.
16669701:68	The 
				 Xic behaved oppositely to other loci on both the future Xi and the future Xa, mirroring the opposite expression patterns of 
				 Xist and most X-linked genes after X-inactivation and suggesting a correlation between the appearance of a locus by FISH and its future expression status.
16669701:69	Azuara et al. [
				 ] reported a correlation between FISH signal appearance and current expression status.
16669701:70	In that study, a replicated transgene tended to exhibit a doublet FISH signal when it was expressed and a singlet FISH signal when it was silenced.
16669701:71	In our study, the replicated allele that more often appeared as a singlet signal in ES cells was the one that would be expressed after X-inactivation is triggered by differentiation.
16669701:72	This result suggests that organization of sequences within the nucleus of a pluripotent embryonic cell may impact their expression after differentiation.
16669701:73	In wild-type ES cells, X chromosomes appear to switch between states in a concerted manner: when one X chromosome assumes the future Xi state, the other adopts the future Xa state.
16669701:74	In heterozygous 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix mutant ES cells, it appears that the X chromosomes no longer switch between states, suggesting that these noncoding RNAs are either required for switching to occur or affect the likelihood that a chromosome will adopt the future Xi or future Xa state each time a switch occurs.
16669701:75	The probability that a chromosome will become the Xi (or the Xa) is determined by the opposing activities of 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix on that chromosome [
				 ].
16669701:76	These observations suggest that 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix influence the fates of both X chromosomes by determining how effectively each chromosome competes to adopt the future Xi (or future Xa) state prior to X-inactivation.
16669701:77	Both 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix RNAs have been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure [
				 –
				 ].
16669701:78	Prior to X-inactivation, these noncoding RNAs can be detected exclusively at the 
				 Xic on both transcriptionally active X chromosomes [
				 ].
16669701:79	Perhaps 
				 Xist and 
				 Tsix RNA mediate changes in chromatin structure at the 
				 Xic prior to X-inactivation.
16669701:80	Such changes may in turn modulate the state of the entire X chromosome and direct its fate.
16669701:81	Our data show that prior to random X-inactivation, X chromosomal loci differ in a manner that is predictive of future expression status.
16669701:82	In addition to X-linked genes, several thousand autosomal genes are also subject to random monoallelic expression.
16669701:83	It has been suggested that random monoallelic loci on autosomes and the X chromosome may share regulatory features [
				 ,
				 ].
16669701:84	It will be interesting to determine whether a common mechanism of concerted switching between two states underlies the randomness of monoallelic expression throughout the genome.

10908591:0	Rhodopsin-like Receptor Family 
The rhodopsin-like family encompasses receptors for a large variety of stimuli, such as biogenic amine neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, peptide hormones, light, nucleotides, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, chemotactic peptides, and chemokines.
10908591:1	Although their ligands vary considerably in structure, the rhodopsin-like GPCRs show sequence conservation within their seven putative TM domains.
10908591:2	Secretin-like Receptor Family 
The secretin-like family includes receptors for many hormones such as secretin, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and parathyroid hormone and related peptides.
10908591:3	The secretin-like receptors are characterized by long NH 2-terminal domains containing five conserved cysteine residues that may form disulfide bonds and by short third cytoplasmic domains.
10908591:4	We identified three novel GPCRs related to vertebrate calcitonin receptors.
10908591:5	Calcitonin receptors are involved in the regulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis in vertebrates.
10908591:6	Two receptors, encoded by CG8422 and CG12370, are related to insect diuretic hormone receptors.
10908591:7	Insect diuretic hormones are a group of peptides involved in the regulation of fluid and ion secretion.
10908591:8	The newly identified Drosophila diuretic hormone receptors share 57% sequence identity, suggestive of a gene duplication.
10908591:9	One novel latrophilin-like receptor gene was also identified (CG8639).
10908591:10	Latrophilins are a heterogeneous group of Ca 2+-independent receptors for α-latrotoxin, a potent presynaptic neurotoxin that stimulates massive neurotransmitter exocytosis leading to nerve terminal degeneration.
10908591:11	The endogenous ligands for latrophilins are unknown and may be involved in control of synaptic exocytosis.
10908591:12	Genes CG11318 and CG15556 define another subgroup in the secretin-like receptor family, coding for two novel receptors that share 41% sequence identity.
10908591:13	These GPCRs are distantly related to the HE6 receptor, a human receptor of unknown function specifically expressed in the epididymis.
10908591:14	Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor–like Family 
The ligands for the metabotropic glutamate–like GPCRs include calcium ions and amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA).
10908591:15	Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in invertebrates, whereas GABA is generally released from inhibitory synaptic terminals.
10908591:16	The metabotropic glutamate–like GPCRs are characterized by very long NH 2-terminal extracellular domains containing ∼17 conserved cysteine residues that may form disulfide bonds.
10908591:17	Eight members of the metabotropic glutamate receptor–like family were identified in the Drosophila genome; seven of them are described here for the first time.
10908591:18	The novel metabotropic glutamate and GABA-B receptor–like genes show very high degrees of sequence conservation with their vertebrate homologues, suggesting similar roles in synaptic function.
10908591:19	Atypical 7 TM Proteins 
The Frizzled-like proteins, Starry night (Flamingo) and Bride of sevenless, are defined here as atypical 7 TM proteins, a group of receptors that share the typical topology of GPCRs but show no sequence conservation with members of the other GPCR families.
10908591:20	These receptors are involved in tissue polarity and cell–cell signaling but their signal transduction pathways are unclear.
10908591:21	However, there is evidence that a rat homologue of the Frizzled-like group couples to G proteins.
10908591:22	We identified a novel atypical 7 TM protein gene, CG4626, which encodes a Frizzled-like protein that is more closely related to mammalian Frizzled 4 than to other Drosophila Frizzled-like proteins.
10908591:23	Starry night (Stan) is a complex protein containing 7 TM domains and several cadherin, EGF-like, and laminin G domains.
10908591:24	The stan gene may have evolved from the combination of ancestral genes coding for a secretin-like GPCR and a cell adhesion molecule.
10908591:25	In Drosophila Stan is implicated in establishment of tissue polarity.
10908591:26	A novel atypical 7 TM protein that may be distantly related to secretin-like GPCRs is encoded by CG20776, which contains multiple TM domains and several leucine-rich repeats thought to be involved in protein–protein interactions.
10908591:27	Bride of sevenless (Boss) is another atypical 7 TM protein that might be distantly related to the metabotropic glutamate–like GPCRs.
10908591:28	In conclusion, GPCRs constitute a very large superfamily of proteins that play a central role in eukaryotic signal transduction.
10908591:29	The families of typical GPCRs include the rhodopsin-like, secretin-like, and metabotropic glutamate–like receptors, fungal mating pheromone, Dictyostelium cAMP receptors, and C. elegans chemoreceptors.
10908591:30	Additionally, there are three putative (or atypical) GPCR families: the Frizzled-like receptors and Drosophila olfactory and putative taste receptors ( ; ).
10908591:31	All the different GPCR families share the same seven membrane–spanning domain topology.
10908591:32	The evolutionary relationship between the different families is uncertain since there are no significant degrees of sequence similarity between them.
10908591:33	It is likely that they have evolved independently and convergently adopted the G protein signal transduction pathway.
10908591:34	Our analysis focused on the typical Drosophila GPCRs, particularly the neurotransmitter and hormone GPCRs, and how they compare with those found in vertebrates and C. elegans . Most of the 100 Drosophila GPCRs described in show a high degree of sequence conservation with vertebrate GPCRs.
10908591:35	Only eight Drosophila GPCRs appear to be more closely related to C. elegans that to vertebrate receptors.
10908591:36	We have identified 68 novel Drosophila GPCRs including the mth -like receptors, a unique subfamily of GPCRs that appears to have no counterpart in vertebrates or C. elegans . There is evidence indicating that the mth -like receptor subfamily plays an important role in Drosophila development, stress response, and regulation of life span.
10908591:37	There has been a large expansion and diversification of chemoreceptors in C. elegans . There is also evidence of an expansion of the peptide receptors in vertebrates and odorant receptors in mammals.
10908591:38	Drosophila GPCRs have not expanded to a similar degree: in particular there appears to be a lower number of peptide receptors than expected.
10908591:39	This is somewhat surprising, since it has been suggested that peptide transmitters predate biogenic amines in evolution.
10908591:40	In C. elegans the expansion of GPCR genes is mirrored by an expansion in G protein subunits: 20 α-, 2 β-, and 2 γ-subunit genes have been identified in the C. elegans genome.
10908591:41	In contrast, the Drosophila genome contains only 6 α-, 3 β-, and 2 γ-subunit genes.
10908591:42	The organization of the GPCR genes in Drosophila genome shows several differences with other eukaryotic genomes analyzed to date.
10908591:43	GPCR genes form large clusters in the genomes of C. elegans and mammals.
10908591:44	In contrast, only small clusters of GPCR genes were identified in the Drosophila genome: six consisting of two genes and one of three genes.
10908591:45	Substantial proportions of the vertebrate GPCR genes are thought to be intronless, but only 5 out of the 100 Drosophila GPCR genes described here were predicted to be intronless.
10908591:46	The C. elegans and mammalian genomes contain a large number of GPCR pseudogenes.
10908591:47	We identified only eight genes in the Drosophila genome that appear to code for incomplete GPCRs, but their identity as pseudogenes will require further experimental investigation.
10908591:48	Now that the full repertoire of Drosophila GPCRs is known, the next step is to match the newly identified receptors with their cognate ligands and biological functions.
10908591:49	Systematic mutation of the Drosophila GPCRs will help determine their roles in development, neural function, and behavior and may also yield insights into the functions and mutational pathologies of their vertebrate homologues.
10908591:50	For example, it is becoming clear that substantial overlap exists in the biological components of addiction in vertebrates and flies; consequently Drosophila should prove invaluable as a model for the study of addiction.
10908591:51	Although it has served as a model organism for nearly a century, Drosophila has now been cast in a new role, which should further the investigation of the mechanisms of development, neural function, and disease, for which the analyses of GPCRs will prove crucial.
18208598:0	Introduction 
Currently, approximately 1 in 4 adult Americans have been diagnosed with a mental disorder, which translates into about 58 million affected people . Though the incidence of mental disorders is higher in America than in other countries, a World Health Organization study of 14 countries reported a worldwide prevalence of mental disorders between 4.3 percent and 26.4 percent . In addition, mental disorders are among the leading causes for disability in the US as well as other countries.
18208598:1	Common mental health disorders include mood disorders, anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), and autism.
18208598:2	However, the four most common mental disorders that cause disabilities are major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) . 
Typically, most of these disorders are treated with prescription drugs, but many of these prescribed drugs cause unwanted side effects.
18208598:3	For example, lithium is usually prescribed for bipolar disorder, but the high-doses of lithium that are normally prescribed causes side effects that include: a dulled personality, reduced emotions, memory loss, tremors, or weight gain . These side effects can be so severe and unpleasant that many patients become noncompliant and, in cases of severe drug toxicity, the situation can become life threatening.
18208598:4	Researchers have observed that the prevalence of mental health disorders has increased in developed countries in correlation with the deterioration of the Western diet . Previous research has shown nutritional deficiencies that correlate with some mental disorders . The most common nutritional deficiencies seen in mental disorder patients are of omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are precursors to neurotransmitters [ - ].
18208598:5	Compelling population studies link high fish consumption to a low incidence of mental disorders; this lower incidence rate has proven to be a direct result of omega-3 fatty acid intake [ , ].
18208598:6	One to two grams of omega-3 fatty acids taken daily is the generally accepted dose for healthy individuals, but for patients with mental disorders, up to 9.6 g has been shown to be safe and efficacious [ - ].
18208598:7	Western diets are usually also lacking in fruits and vegetables, which further contributes to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
18208598:8	This article will focus on the nutritional deficiencies that are associated with mental disorders and will outline how dietary supplements can be implemented in the treatment of several disorders (see Table for an overview).
18208598:9	The mental disorders and treatments covered in this review do not include the broad and complex range of disorders, but however focuses on the four most common disorders in order to emphasize the alternative or complementary nutritional options that health care providers can recommend to their patients.
18208598:10	Conclusion 
Here we have shown just a few of the many documented nutritional therapies that can be utilized when treating mental disorders.
18208598:11	Many of these studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s, but were soon discontinued because they were underfunded.
18208598:12	Nutritional therapies have now become a long-forgotten method of treatment, because they were of no interest to pharmaceutical companies that could not patent or own them.
18208598:13	Instead, the companies that funded most clinical research spent their dollars investigating synthetic drugs they could patent and sell; these drugs however usually caused adverse side effects.
18208598:14	There is tremendous resistance to using supplements as treatments from clinicians, mostly due to their lack of knowledge on the subject.
18208598:15	Others rather use prescription drugs that the drug companies and the FDA researches, monitors and recalls if necessary.
18208598:16	However, for some patients, prescription drugs do not have the efficacy of nutritional supplements and they sometimes have far more dangerous side effects.
18208598:17	So for clinicians to avoid these supplement therapies because of a lack of knowledge and unwillingness to use treatments not backed by drug companies and the FDA, they are compromising their patients' recovery due to their own laziness or selfishness.
18208598:18	Clinical studies that show the ability of a prescription drug to effectively treat mental disorders will often argue that supplements as treatments, when unmonitored, are more risky than prescription drugs and may ineffectively treat a patient's symptoms.
18208598:19	For example one study listed several methods of treatment, none of which include natural compounds, for OCD patients that include: megadoses of SSRIs, intravenous chlomipramine, oral morphine, deep brain stimulation, and functional neurosurgery . Most of these treatments are invasive or unnatural and will inevitably cause severe side effects to the patient, whose symptoms will probably still reoccur over time.
18208598:20	Another example of the literature scaring clinicians away from supplement therapies is an article that warns patients about the dangers of consuming high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
18208598:21	This manuscript involves a patient who was taking approximately 10 times more than the recommended dose of omega-3 supplements . Numerous studies have shown that up 2 grams of EPA (omega-3 fatty acid) taken daily is sufficient for decreasing symptoms of several mental health disorders with no side effects.
18208598:22	This publication with a megadose of omega-3 fatty acids stresses the importance of monitoring the consumption of supplements as well as prescribed drugs, preferably through regular consultations with a licensed health care professional.
18208598:23	Proper medical diagnosis and a clear description of all possible treatment options should always be the first plan of action when treating mental disorders.
18208598:24	However, the final decision on whether or not to try nutritional supplements as a treatment must be based on the patient preferences.
18208598:25	Now with consumers becoming more interested in natural and holistic therapies, nutritional therapies have been well-received, and some studies are again underway in these areas.
18208598:26	New well-designed clinical studies are being published daily on the positive effects of nutritional and supplement therapies on all types of disorders and diseases.
18208598:27	It will take some time for clinicians to become educated on all the options available, but this is an important task that should not be ignored.
18208598:28	Those with influence in this field should continue to examine natural treatments on the scientific level in order to increase the availability of grant money for this type of research.
18208598:29	This will lead to a surge of researchers who will submit proposals for grants enabling laboratories to further investigate the hypothesis that proper nutrition contributes to better mental health.
18208598:30	Psychiatrists treating patients with mental disorders should be aware of available nutritional therapies, appropriate doses, and possible side effects in order to provide alternative and complementary treatments for their patients.
18208598:31	This may reduce the number of noncompliant patients suffering from mental disorders that choose not to take their prescribed medications.
18208598:32	As with any form of treatment, nutritional therapy should be supervised and doses should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal results.
null:0	Introduction 
Idiopathic scoliosis has no known cause.
null:1	One the potential hypothesis is the influence of an asymmetrical nervous command on the muscles acting the spine.
null:2	The aim of this study is to compare idiopathic scoliosis patients (ISP) and control adolescents (CTRL) during locomotion at comfortable speed.
null:3	The specific purposes of this study are to compare both groups during walking 1) for EMG activity of the erector spinea muscles and the kinematics (acceleration) of the spine in the antero-posterior (A/P) direction and 2) for the kinetics (moment, power and work) at the ankle, knee and hip.
null:4	Material and methods 
A total of nine ISP and ten control subjects were asked to walk for 10 trials on a 10 m walkway.
null:5	The ISP had a mean Cobb angle of 17 o and their mean age, height and weight were 14,9y, 158cm and 51,5kg respectively while it was 14,4y, 161,2cm and 55kg for the CTRL group.
null:6	A total of 30 reflective makers placed on anatomical landmarks were tracked with by 8-camera VICON system while muscle activation were collected from eight EMG electrodes placed on the erector spinea muscle at C7, T4, T10 and L2 levels.

11553322:0	Background 
During positive inotropy there is an increase in ATP utilization and thus myocardial oxygen consumption related to increased cross-bridge cycling and calcium handling . Heat measurements of isolated heart muscle have assigned approximately 50% of total energy consumption to cross-bridge cycling and 20% to calcium cycling .
11553322:1	However, recently, studies in both isolated hearts and myocytes , examining the energetic effects of increasing inotropy with the calcium sensitizing agent EMD 57033 have suggested that the energetic cost associated with increasing inotropy is largely related to calcium cycling.
11553322:2	In these studies EMD 57033 resulted in only small increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and this was felt related to the ability of EMD 57033 to increase inotropy without increasing calcium cycling (though intracellular calcium was not directly measured).
11553322:3	Consistent with this Brandes et al  have studied the contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to total mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis as measured by NADH levels using fluorescent spectroscopy of rat cardiac trabeculae.
11553322:4	They concluded that there was an equal contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to total ATP hydrolysis.
11553322:5	In the present study, we hypothesized that energy consumption during altered inotropy is largely to related calcium handling.
11553322:6	To study this we directly measured developed pressures, myocardial oxygen consumption and used a newly developed technique to measure intracellular calcium in perfused mouse hearts with the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye rhod-2  during calcium-induced inotropy and with dobutamine.
11553322:7	In addition we studied the perfused mouse heart, as the ability to manipulate the murine genome will likely provide important information about the molecular determinants of energy consumption in the heart.
11553322:8	The mechanisms controlling calcium-induced inotropy are probably several fold, and include activation of protein kinase C , of which several isoforms are calcium dependent.
11553322:9	Protein kinase C decreases maximal actomyosin MgATPase activity through phosphorylation of troponin I . This would be predicted to result in a reduction in force (or developed pressure) relative to intracellular calcium resulting in an energetically inefficient state.
11553322:10	Thus, we predicted that high perfusate calcium positive inotropy would result in lower developed pressures relative to both intracellular calcium and myocardial oxygen consumption compared to dobutamine, and that high perfusate calcium would be associated with evidence of protein kinase C activation, though not dobutamine.
11553322:11	Results 
During increases in perfusate calcium (1.5 – 3.5 mM) there were stepwise increases in developed pressure, and developed pressures with dobutamine were significantly higher than perfusate calcium 3.5 mM (Figure ).
11553322:12	Peak systolic intracellular calcium increased minimally between 1.5 and 2.5 mM despite significant increases in developed pressures indicating increased myofilament responsiveness to calcium at perfusate calcium 2.5 compared to 1.5 mM (Figure ).
11553322:13	Also, indicating reduced myofilament responsiveness to perfusate calcium 3.5 mM compared to dobutamine, levels of peak intracellular calcium were similar for these 2 interventions despite higher developed pressure with dobutamine.
11553322:14	Increases in myocardial oxygen consumption reflected the changes in peak intracellular calcium, in that there were minimal changes between 1.5 and 2.5 mM perfusate calcium, and myocardial oxygen consumption was not significantly different between perfusate calcium 3.5 mM and dobutamine (Figure ).
11553322:15	Thus, the ratio of developed pressure to myocardial oxygen consumption, an index of economy of contraction, significantly increased between 1.5 and 2.5 mM perfusate calcium and was significantly higher with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium (Figure ).
11553322:16	To further explore the differences between dobutamine and high calcium positive inotropy, analysis of pressure and calcium transient waveforms and phase-plane plots relating pressure to calcium was performed.
11553322:17	Pressure waveforms were significantly abbreviated with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium (total waveform duration: 100 ± 15 vs 125 ± 0 ms, p < 0.01).
11553322:18	The time from onset of the pressure waveform to peak pressure was not significantly different between dobutamine and high calcium (45 ± 3 vs 52 ± 7 ms, p=NS), though the time from peak pressure to fall to baseline was significantly shorter with dobutamine compared to high calcium (55 ± 12 vs 73 ± 7 ms, p < 0.05).
11553322:19	An example of a normalized pressure waveform is shown in Figure . No significant differences were seen with calcium transient durations at any level of perfusate calcium or dobutamine (examples Figure and ).
11553322:20	Total transient duration at 3.5 mM perfusate calcium was 106 ± 20 ms and with dobutamine was 93 ± 22 ms (p=NS), and there was also no significant difference in the time from onset of the transient to peak (3.5 mM perfusate calcium 33 ± 8 vs dobutamine 38 ± 14 ms, p=NS), or difference in the duration between the peak of the transient to return to baseline (3.5 mM perfusate calcium 72 ± 25 vs dobutamine 60 ± 25 ms, p=NS).
11553322:21	Phase-plane plots illustrate that high perfusate calcium results in a similar increase in intracellular calcium compared to dobutamine though relatively smaller increase in pressure (Figure and ).
11553322:22	Thus, the ratio of pressure to calcium at the point of peak systolic pressure is significantly higher with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium (0.103 ± 0.009 vs 0.081 ± 0.012 mmHg/nM, p < 0.05, Figure ).
11553322:23	The increase in the 'dynamic trajectory' of the phase-plane plot between peak calcium and peak pressure may relate to underlying changes in the steady-state force-calcium relationship as proposed by Hunter . 
The specific protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine significantly inhibited high calcium positive inotropy (2.5 to 3.5 mM, p < 0.05), though had no effects on dobutamine, or with lower levels of perfusate calcium (1.5 to 2.5 mM) (Figure ).
11553322:24	The effects of chelerythrine were mediated through preventing the expected increase in systolic and diastolic intracellular calcium (figure ).
11553322:25	The difference in myocardial oxygen consumption between 2.5 and 3.5 mM perfusate calcium was significantly reduced with the addition of chelerythrine (Δ 2.5 to 3.5 mM alone: 9.1 ± 2.8 vs Δ 2.5 to 3.5 mM + chelerythrine: 5.4 ± 1.2 μmoles/min/g dry wt., p < 0.05).
11553322:26	Also, chelerythrine had no significant effects on developed pressures at a constant perfusate calcium of 2.5 mM (53 ± 9 to 50 ± 10 mmHg, p=NS).
11553322:27	Discussion 
In the present study we have directly related developed pressures, myocardial oxygen consumption and intracellular calcium in perfused mouse hearts.
11553322:28	The results demonstrate that there are significant differences between high perfusate calcium and the predominant β-adrenergic agonist dobutamine in the perfused mouse heart.
11553322:29	High perfusate calcium results in less myofilament calcium responsiveness and reduced energetic efficiency compared to dobutamine and also is dependent in part on protein kinase C activation.
11553322:30	There are also significant differences in myofilament responses to calcium and energetic efficiency between different levels of perfusate calcium.
11553322:31	These data support the hypothesis that intracellular calcium cycling is responsible for a significant proportion of total myocardial oxygen consumption during changes in inotropy , and thus alterations in myofilament protein calcium responsiveness may result in a significant effect on the energetic characteristics of a particular inotrope.
11553322:32	Protein kinase C phosphorylation of troponin I (predominantly at serines 43/45) results in a decrease in maximal actin-myosin ATPase activity , and also a decrease in the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus through cross-phosphorylation of protein kinase A sites (serines 23/24) on troponin I . Dobutamine, which is predominantly a β-adrenergic agonist, activates protein kinase A, which mediates a reduction in the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus through phosphorylation of troponin I, though it does not effect maximal actin-myosin ATPase activity . The findings suggesting that protein kinase C is activated at higher levels of perfusate calcium (though not with dobutamine) may indicate a role for protein kinase C in the energetic inefficiency associated with high calcium.
11553322:33	That force does not increase proportionate to the rise in intracellular calcium during calcium-induced inotropy maybe related to 'down stream' effects of protein kinase C, such as phosphorylation of troponin I reducing maximal actin-myosin ATPase activity . Indeed, recently we have shown that in a transgenic mouse expressing mutant troponin I lacking protein kinase C phosphorylation sites that during high perfusate calcium inotropy that there is a significant elevation in the ratio of developed pressure to myocardial oxygen consumption relative to wild type controls . This data together with the data in the present manuscript provides reasonable evidence that activation of protein kinase C during high calcium-induced inotropy reduces maximal myofilament calcium responsiveness resulting in a decrease in developed pressure relative to peak systolic calcium, and energetic inefficiency.
11553322:34	Also, conditional expression of protein kinase C β in mice , which is well suited to study the immediate effects of protein kinase C activation, is associated with increased contractility and calcium transients and decreased maximal tension development by myofilaments when expression is turned on.
11553322:35	This compares favorably with our data showing that protein kinase C inhibition results in decreased contractility and reduced calcium transients.
11553322:36	The abbreviation of the pressure waveforms with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium is another marked difference between these 2 forms of positive inotropy.
11553322:37	Differences in phosphorylation of proteins involved in relaxation such as troponin I and phospholamban may account for this .
11553322:38	We have not found any difference in the calcium transient duration to accompany the pressure waveform findings.
11553322:39	This may relate to the relatively limited number of sampling points (N = 8) used in obtaining calcium transients or motion artifact related to the inotropic state.
11553322:40	Recent improvements in acquisition software and recording capabilities will likely improve our ability to analyze calcium transients in detail.
11553322:41	Conclusions 
In the perfused mouse heart, high perfusate calcium positive inotropy compared to dobutamine results in reduced myofilament calcium responsiveness, decreased energetic efficiency and is dependent in part on protein kinase C activation.
11553322:42	It must be recognized that agents that increase the amplitude of the calcium transient through activation of protein kinase A, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors are associated with adverse outcomes in congestive heart failure patients , and so our findings with dobutamine are unlikely to translate into clinical benefit.
11553322:43	Nevertheless, these results illustrate the importance of calcium handling in the energetic efficiency of an inotrope, and these methods will be useful in studying genetically engineered mouse models with altered myofilament calcium responsiveness.

19674958:0	Introduction 
Many laypeople obtain individualized cancer risk estimates from Internet-based risk assessment tools.
19674958:1	Data from the 2005 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which comprises a representative sample of the United States’ adult population, reveal that approximately 25% of people have used the Internet to seek information about cancer .
19674958:2	Although the proportion of people who sought information about their cancer risk is not known, use of online cancer risk assessment tools is common.
19674958:3	For example, the Your Disease Risk website averaged nearly 2000 visitors per day in 2006 (personal communication by Graham Colditz, 2006), and the National Cancer Institute’s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool averaged over 1200 hits per day in 2007 (personal communication by Rick Manrow, 2008).
19674958:4	The purpose of providing people with individualized risk estimates is to encourage them to engage in health-promoting behaviors , such as using the health care system appropriately, making good medical decisions, engaging in health screening, avoiding tobacco use, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet.
19674958:5	To achieve this, it is crucial that the information be presented in a way that facilitates comprehension and does not bias risk perceptions . 
Gurmankin Levy and colleagues  examined the quality of risk estimates for 13 breast cancer risk assessment websites.
19674958:6	Many of these risk assessment tools used different risk factors to calculate risk, and in some cases excluded well-established risk factors, such as age at first live birth.
19674958:7	Consequently, it is not surprising that the risk estimates provided for a particular risk profile varied across assessment tools.
19674958:8	These authors  also found that many Internet-based risk assessment tools did not provide sufficient information to evaluate website quality.
19674958:9	For example, some websites did not contain information about institutional affiliations or identify the statistical model used to calculate risk . Because millions of people seek cancer risk information from Internet sources , the public health implications of inaccurate or inadequate risk communication are clear.
19674958:10	Risk assessment tools that provide incorrect information may lead people to experience negative outcomes, such as seeking too much or too little medical care.
19674958:11	Even when risk assessment tools provide accurate risk estimates, the information needs to be presented clearly.
19674958:12	People do not always understand probabilistic information [ - ], even though they often report wanting to use it to make medical decisions . The dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that risk perceptions, risk comprehension, and decision making can be affected by the ways in which probability information is presented [ - ].
19674958:13	For example, arrays of stick figures (also referred to as “pictographs” and “icon arrays”) can make it easier for people to understand the effects of hypothetical medical treatments and can reduce the undue influence that side effects have on hypothetical treatment decisions . Misperceiving one’s risk of illness may result in poor health decisions.
19674958:14	For example, a woman who overestimates her risk of developing cervical cancer might undergo excessive screening, but she might also be so overwhelmed with anxiety that she avoids screening entirely.
19674958:15	A number of researchers have tested various ways to communicate probabilistic risk information [ , - ].
19674958:16	According to these studies, the optimal risk communication format depends on what the communication is expected to accomplish.
19674958:17	For example, presenting a drug’s benefit only as a relative risk reduction (“reduce the overall mortality by 20.3%”) can be more effective in persuading physicians to prescribe a drug than presenting only absolute risk reduction information (“reduce overall mortality from 7.8%...to...6.3%”)  (page 123).
19674958:18	However, if the goal is education rather than persuasion, providing both absolute and relative information is most effective . Thus, no single risk communication format will be appropriate in all situations and under all conditions.
19674958:19	If the goal of Internet-based risk assessment tools is to assist people in making good decisions about their health, they must communicate probabilistic risk information in a way that facilitates comprehension and reduces biased interpretations . A large and growing literature on risk communication permits us to infer which formats are likely to be most useful in helping people understand cancer risk estimates.
19674958:20	However, it is unknown how these formats interact with each other to influence perceptions of risk.
19674958:21	Consequently, should not be viewed as a checklist of required criteria, but instead as a list of important factors to take into consideration when developing a tool.
19674958:22	Just as readers would not use a statistical test without understanding its underlying principles, they should not develop a risk assessment tool without having some rudimentary understanding of how different risk communication formats might affect risk perceptions and comprehension.
19674958:23	Comprehensive reviews of the complex issues surrounding probabilistic risk communication can be found at [ , - ].
19674958:24	This study describes the risk communication formats that Internet-based cancer risk assessment tools use to convey individualized risk information to the public.
19674958:25	This study asks two questions that, to our knowledge, have not been addressed previously: (1) Do the tools use risk communication formats that have been empirically shown to facilitate comprehension, and (2) Does the use of these formats vary by website affiliation?
19674958:26	Following Gurmankin Levy and colleagues , we also examined whether the websites provided the basic information necessary to evaluate the quality of the risk estimate (ie, the statistical model or peer-reviewed citations).
19674958:27	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Internet-based cancer risk assessment tools can provide cancer risk and prevention information to millions of people worldwide.
19674958:28	Effective risk communication has the potential to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality by motivating people to engage in healthy behaviors.
19674958:29	However, poorly communicated risk information could mislead people or frighten them unduly, resulting in maladaptive health behaviors , such as over- or under-utilization of health care services.
19674958:30	In October 2007, 47 Internet-based cancer risk assessment tools provided individualized cancer risk information to the public.
19674958:31	Almost half (20 out of 47) of these websites were developed by cancer centers (n = 8) and the health care industry (n = 12).
19674958:32	The three most common organ sites for which assessment tools were available (breast, lung, colorectal) corresponded to the most common causes of cancer mortality among men and women in the United States . This suggests that the assessment tools are responding to a public health need.
19674958:33	However, three factors suggest that some of these websites might not be as useful to the public as they seem at first glance.
19674958:34	First, many of the websites did not identify the statistical model used to calculate the risk estimate.
19674958:35	Thus, visitors to these sites would have no way to verify that the risk assessment model had been scientifically vetted.
19674958:36	The second factor that raises questions about the utility of some of these tools is the extensive use of undefined scientific terminology.
19674958:37	Terms like “biopsy” and “radon progeny” may be confusing for individuals with limited literacy, thereby limiting their usefulness.
19674958:38	The third factor that raises concerns about these tools is the fact that they varied widely in their use of risk communication formats that facilitate comprehension of probabilistic information.
19674958:39	For some risk communication formats, most websites followed experts’ recommendations (eg, 39 of 47 sites provided safety messages).
19674958:40	For other formats, few websites followed recommendations (eg, 3 of 47 sites used positive and negative framing).
19674958:41	It is unclear whether it is necessary to include all of the risk communication formats identified in in a single communication effort.
19674958:42	Indeed, it is possible that doing so would overwhelm people with too much information and bias their risk perceptions .
19674958:43	However, risk perceptions can also be biased if people receive too little information.
19674958:44	For example, seven websites provided information seekers with a simple count of risk factors or a “risk score.”
19674958:45	One such website then informed people, “You should do something to reduce your risk,” but it did not provide specific safety messages, such as “stop smoking.”
19674958:46	Telling people to “do something” without providing specific recommendations does not facilitate comprehension  and might be counterproductive . 
Two websites underscore the potential pitfalls of communicating risk using only numbers or only words.
19674958:47	One of these websites provided two numerical risk estimates: one represented the risk if the information seeker continued the health-damaging behavior, and the other represented the risk if the individual stopped the behavior.
19674958:48	However, the absolute risk was low in both cases (2% if the behavior continued and 1% if the behavior stopped), which might discourage people from changing their behavior [ , ].
19674958:49	The second website provided risk information as words only.
19674958:50	It described cancer risk as “moderate,” “increased,” “high,” and “highest.”
19674958:51	There was no “low risk” category.
19674958:52	Thus, an 18-year-old with no risk factors for the type of cancer addressed on this website would be informed that he has a “moderate” risk of cancer.
19674958:53	The combination of using only words to describe a risk and using the word “moderate” to describe the lowest-risk category might exaggerate risk perceptions among people at lowest risk . 
It is also important to note that online risk assessment tools often have different objectives.
19674958:54	For example, some risk assessment tools are designed to educate people about healthy lifestyles, whereas others are designed to persuade people to use their services, purchase their products, or engage in a particular health behavior.
19674958:55	While it may be acceptable to attempt to persuade people to purchase necessary goods or services, or to engage in appropriate health behaviors, it is incumbent on developers of cancer risk assessment tools to consider the point at which persuasion may infringe upon an individual’s ability to make an informed decision.
19674958:56	It is beyond the scope of this study to assess the underlying motivations of the various risk assessment tool developers, but website developers, clinicians, researchers, and public health officials should consider the ethical implications of the tools they design.
19674958:57	Despite these concerns, cancer risk assessment tools have the potential to play an important role in cancer prevention and control.
19674958:58	However, in order to be acceptable and effective, they should use language that is appropriate for low-literacy populations, communicate risk estimates using formats that increase comprehension and reduce biased interpretations of risk, and provide information about the model used to calculate the estimate.
19674958:59	As mentioned previously, the communication formats chosen will depend upon the goals of the communication.
19674958:60	For example, if a developer’s goal is to educate women about how the risk of breast cancer increases with age, the ideal website might use a line graph to portray how her risk changes over time .
19674958:61	It might describe in words how the risk changes and add the probability estimates at 5-year intervals.
19674958:62	It might also include lines that depict the “average woman’s” risk over the same time period and the risk of heart disease over the same time period.
19674958:63	The website would include accurate information about how often women should undergo mammography screening, how to obtain a mammogram, and how to maintain a healthy weight.
19674958:64	A statement would inform visitors that the risk estimate contains some uncertainty, and it would identify the statistical model that was used to generate the risk estimate.
19674958:65	Finally, before the website is released to the public, it would be tested for readability and comprehensibility among people with low literacy and to ensure that it elicited relatively unbiased risk perceptions.
19674958:66	If it was found to be confusing, the website developer might consider removing some of the information, such as how the woman’s risk of breast cancer compared to her risk of heart disease.
19674958:67	It might also test whether providing users with control over the amount of information displayed—such as being able to add or remove the 5-year probability estimates—results in better outcomes.
20661442:0	Introduction 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA (sRNA) molecules that has recently emerged as a key regulator of gene activity.
20661442:1	In plants, miRNAs are released from larger precursors (pri-miRNAs) in the nucleus mainly, by DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) . The resulting sRNA duplex is methylated and translocated to the cytoplasm where it can be loaded into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that includes a member of the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family as catalytic component.
20661442:2	The RISC can then recognize mRNAs containing sequences complementary to the loaded miRNA . In plants, cleavage of the target mRNA is an important mechanism for plant miRNA action, but there are also direct effects on protein accumulation, as reported for many animal miRNAs – . 
The spatio-temporal expression pattern of miRNA genes is regulated to a large extent at the transcriptional level, and different members of a miRNA family can have distinct, specialized expression domains – .
20661442:3	An additional layer of regulation in miRNA action has been reported by Franco-Zorrilla and colleagues . IPS1 ( INDUCED BY PHOSPHATE STARVATION 1 ) encodes a non-coding RNA with a short motif that is highly complementary to the sequence of miR399, which like IPS1 is involved in the response to phosphate starvation – . In contrast to regular miRNA target sites, the IPS1 sequence contains a three-nucleotide insertion in the center, corresponding to the position where normally miRNA-guided cleavage takes place, and this bulge in the miRNA/target pair prevents endonucleolytic cleavage of IPS1 transcripts.
20661442:4	This results in sequestration of RISC miR399, leading to a reduction of miR399 activity.
20661442:5	A similar phenomenon, negative regulation of small RNA activity by a partially complementary mRNA, has been recently described in bacteria as well . 
MiRNA target mimicry can be exploited to study the effects of reducing the function of entire miRNA families . Simultaneous inactivation of all miRNA family members by constructing multiply mutant lines has so far been achieved for only two relatively small families . Plant target mimics are conceptually similar to miRNA sponges, used to reduce miRNA activity in animals.
20661442:6	MiRNA sponges are transcripts containing multiple miRNA binding sites that compete with endogenous target mRNAs, thereby reducing the efficiency of the corresponding miRNA .
20661442:7	Although in animals perfect-match miRNA binding sites seems sufficient to sequester miRNAs such optimal sites would be generally cleaved in plants, and they would not succeed in sequestering the miRNA-loaded RISC.
20661442:8	Consistent with this, plants overexpressing non-modified versions of miR156 and miR319 target genes show much milder phenotypes than plants expressing the corresponding target mimics , . Modifications of the miRNA binding site that prevent cleavage but still allow miRNA binding are therefore required to reduce miRNA activity in plants.
20661442:9	Here, we present a collection of transgenic plants expressing artificial target mimics designed to knockdown the majority of Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA families.
20661442:10	One fifth of these lines have obvious morphological defects, which is in the same range as the approximately 10% of miRNA knockouts that caused phenotypic abnormalities or lethality in Caenorhabditis elegans . We found a clear correlation between the evolutionary conservation of plant miRNA families and their effect on aerial plant morphology.
21829677:0	Introduction 
Accurate passage through mitosis is a highly orchestrated process that relies on the timely coordination of multiple events to ensure proper segregation of genetic material.
21829677:1	Errors in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy, a well-known hallmark of human cancers.
21829677:2	A key mechanism that ensures each daughter cell receives the correct chromosome content is the maintenance of the physical links between sister chromatids until all chromosomes become properly bioriented on the mitotic spindle . Sister chromatids are held together by cohesin, a multisubunit protein complex that is loaded along the length of each pair concomitant with replication in S phase .
21829677:3	A majority of the cohesin resides on the chromosome arms and is removed at the beginning of mitosis, whereas centromeric cohesin remains bound until the metaphase-to-anaphase transition . The prophase removal of cohesin involves the activity of the kinases Plk1 and Aurora B as well as the physical interaction of the protein Wapl with the cohesin complex . In contrast, the removal of cohesin at the onset of anaphase requires the protease separase, which cleaves the cohesin subunit Scc1 . Separase is activated at anaphase onset when the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets its inhibitor securin for degradation and reduces Cdk1 activity . The APC/C activity targeting securin is inhibited by the spindle assembly checkpoint until all chromosomes are fully aligned on the metaphase plate.
21829677:4	When the last pair of chromatids properly aligns, the checkpoint is turned off, which leads to APC/C-mediated degradation of securin, and in turn activates separase.
21829677:5	Separase then cleaves the centromeric cohesin in a coordinated manner so that cohesin is lost from all sister chromatids as the cell enters anaphase.
21829677:6	Previous studies have investigated the consequences of uncoupling these regulated events and have shown how important their coordination is for proper chromosome segregation and progression through mitosis , . 
Under conditions where the checkpoint signal is sustained in the presence of fully aligned chromosomes, cells persist in mitosis for a variable amount of time before the metaphase plate begins to break down.
21829677:7	This phenotype, termed chromosome scattering, was initially described as a result of inhibition of the spindle and kinetochore associated protein Ska3 and was later observed in cells expressing a point mutant of the kinetochore protein Spindly .
21829677:8	Since both perturbations cause the checkpoint to remain active without interfering with chromosome alignment, we hypothesized that chromosome scattering is not perturbation specific, but rather a general result of prolonged arrest in metaphase.
21829677:9	In the present study we set out to determine how frequently cells scatter their chromosomes after a persistent arrest in a relatively unperturbed mitosis and to investigate the factors contributing to this phenotype.
21829677:10	Using both live cell and fixed image analyses we found chromosome scattering to occur in a wide variety of conditions that prevent exit from mitosis with a completely or near-completely aligned metaphase plate.
21829677:11	Cells with scattered chromosomes had partial loss of chromatid cohesion and defects in spindle structure.
21829677:12	Scattering was inhibited by either stabilizing microtubules or by preventing the removal of cohesion.
21829677:13	These results establish that uncoordinated loss of chromatid cohesion is a common outcome of extended metaphase arrest in human cells.
21829677:14	Results 
Discussion 
In this study, we describe an aberrant mitotic state that is induced in karyotypically normal and abnormal human cells by multiple perturbations that prevent normal progression into anaphase.
21829677:15	Entry into this state is triggered by partial and uncoordinated loss of sister chromatid cohesion on chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate.
21829677:16	Spindle checkpoint activation on the single chromatids leads to persistence in a mitotic state with increasing loss of cohesion and subsequent spindle defects, followed by an eventual non anaphase-like exit and/or cell death.
21829677:17	These results suggest that chromatid cohesion is placed under stress in an attached bi-oriented state and extending this state can lead to cohesion failure.
21829677:18	Discovery of this phenotype as a general result of prolonged metaphase arrest has implications for the interpretation of mitotic defects following perturbation of specific components and for the mechanistic analysis of anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic strategies.
21886909:0	Introduction 
Candesartan, (±)1-{[(cyclohexyloxy)carbonyl]oxy}ethyl 2-ethoxy-1-{[2′-(1 H -tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}-1 H -benzimidazole-7-carboxylate, a nonpeptide, is a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents . Candesartan cilexetil [CC], is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
21886909:1	CC has log P value of 6.1 and the aqueous solubility of CC is less than 5×10 −5 g/L which may be the reason for very low bioavailability i.e. about 15% . Solubility of poorly soluble compounds can be increased by formulating as aqueous pH-shifted solutions, provided the molecules are ionizable, in mixtures of water and organic co-solvents, or by solubilization in Cyclodextrins  or using emulsions .
21886909:2	With the exception of the pH-shifted aqueous solutions, significant amounts of additives are often needed to increase the solubility into the millimolar range, which may induce unwanted side effects .
21886909:3	It would be more desirable to have a universal formulation approach to process any poorly soluble drug.
21886909:4	A classical formulation approach for such poorly soluble drugs is micronization, where a coarse drug powder is milled to an ultrafine powder with a mean particle size being typically in the range of 1–10 μm.
21886909:5	The principle is to increase the dissolution velocity by enlarging the surface area of the drug powder .
21886909:6	However, many of the new drugs exhibit so low solubility, that even micronization does not help to improve their bioavailability.
21886909:7	Similarly, micronization of CC did not lead to significant enhancement in dissolution rate . Thus, there is urgent need to have some innovative formulation approach to enhance the bioavailability.
21886909:8	Nanosuspension [NS] is the best alternative and universal approach for poorly soluble drugs, especially which are insoluble in aqueous as well as organic media simultaneously, to enhance bioavailability  . Advances in technology and better understanding of the NS systems have attracted attention of formulation development scientists towards preparation of such systems.
21886909:9	NS is sub-micron colloidal dispersion of drug particles which are stabilized by surfactant.
21886909:10	It has two outstanding features: it is able to increase saturation solubility and consequently also increases the dissolution velocity . 
In general, NS can be produced by three techniques, top-down, bottom-up and combination of both.
21886909:11	Media milling and high pressure homogenization are two basic approaches of top-down technique.
21886909:12	In milling approach, drug powder is dispersed in a surfactant solution and the obtained suspension is poured in the milling container containing milling beads made from glass, stainless steel, zirconium oxide, or highly cross-linked polystyrene resins.
21886909:13	Then drug is nanosized by moving the beads, either by using a stirrer or by moving the mill container itself . The Media milling techniques is very easy and simple method to prepare NS.
21886909:14	Although the bottom-up approaches hold tremendous potential with respect to improving bioavailability by obtaining smaller particle sizes [<100 nm] and amorphous drug particles, no commercial application of these systems has yet been realized.
21886909:15	Recently, it was reported that amorphous NSs are prone to Ostwald ripening; a process that leads to the growth of particles as time progresses.
21886909:16	However, by incorporating a second component of extremely low aqueous solubility [inhibitors], Ostwald ripening can be inhibited.
21886909:17	But, to inhibit ripening, the drug/inhibitor mixture [in the particles] must form a single phase; that is, the drug must be soluble in the inhibitor.
21886909:18	However, when phase separation between the drug and inhibitor occurs, Ostwald ripening cannot be prevented .
21886909:19	Also, preparation of stable amorphous NS is tough and long term stabilization of amorphous drug particles is not easy.
21886909:20	Hence, the easier and more viable top-down approaches are being preferred for the production of NS.
21886909:21	Currently, nine NS based formulation are available in the US market and all are FDA approved from the year 2000 on.
21886909:22	All these products are based on top-down approaches, eight relying on media milling and one on high-pressure homogenization.
21886909:23	This itself explains the popularity of the top-down approach and also emphasizes the ease of industrial scale up of this technology.
21886909:24	A third remarkable point is that all commercial products are intended for oral delivery . 
Benefits of these systems are proved by number of products in market based on these techniques.
21886909:25	Hence, the aim of present investigation was to prepare NS of CC for the enhancement of oral bioavailability.
21886909:26	The drug [CC] was nanosized by media milling technique, characterized, and evaluated for improvement in bioavailability by pharmacodynamic study by measuring the blood pressure lowering effects in deoxycorticosterone acetate [DOCA] salt model induced hypertensive rats.
21886909:27	Material and Methods 
Results and Discussion 
Characterization of Nanosuspension 
Conclusion 
Formulation strategy of using nanocrystalline drug was investigated as a way to improve bioavailability of the Candesartan cilexetil.
21886909:28	Media milling method using zirconium oxide beads was effective in nanosizing the drug and the spray dried nanosuspension showed improved stability compared to nanosuspension.
21886909:29	XRD pattern and DSC results revealed the unchanged crystalline nature of CC in the spray dried product.
21886909:30	Saturation solubility of CC was increased 22.44 times than that of bulk drug by nanosuspension formulation.
21886909:31	In case of spray dried nanosuspension the increased surface area, higher saturation solubility and reduced diffusion distance led to increased dissolution velocity.
21886909:32	The spray dried formulation was stable for two months at refrigeration condition.
21886909:33	The results of the pharmacodynamic study showed significant reduction in blood pressure for nanosuspension as compare to plain drug suspension.
21886909:34	Thus, the results of the in vitro and pharmacodynamic studies conclusively demonstrated significant enhancement in antihypertensive activity of candesartan when formulated as nanosuspension.

21042424:0	Introduction 
Advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy require improvements in the agents used to image and treat disease.
21042424:1	Valuable modifications include those that enable these agents to specifically target disease, increase signal-to-noise, rapidly clear from the blood, and incorporate multiple imaging and therapeutic modalities.
21042424:2	Carbon nanomaterials are being investigated as delivery platforms for diagnostic and therapeutic cargoes to target disease.
21042424:3	Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of soluble, covalently-functionalized, radiolabeled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have demonstrated rapid blood compartment clearance, high specific activity (SA), multimodal imaging capability, renal elimination, and tumor-specific accumulation in vivo.
21042424:4	– Implementation of an imaging and therapeutic drug construct that is designed to target, report location, and irradiate the tumor vessels is a key strategic modification that will take advantage of the single wall CNT (SWCNT)-based construct’s chemical, radiochemical, and PK properties.
21042424:5	Many cancers are characterized by an extensive angiogenic, aberrant vascular network that supports the tumor proliferation and survival.
21042424:6	The endothelial vessels in tumors often do not exhibit the same organizational hierarchy of arterioles, capillaries, and venules present in normal tissue.
21042424:7	Instead, tumor vessels are tortuous and have abnormal component and structural composition.
21042424:8	Endothelial cells in these tumors are inefficiently and irregularly joined with holes, gaps, and defects; pericytes are absent or loosely associated with vessels; and basement membranes are inefficiently applied relative to typical normal tissues.
21042424:9	The pore diameters of tumor typically range from 40 to 80 nm.
21042424:10	Large interendothelial junctions in cancerous tissue may be as large as 500 nm, whereas in healthy tissue, these junctions are ~8 nm.
21042424:11	Angiogenic endothelial cells express the monomeric vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cad) epitope on the cell surface that upon dimerizing with another monomeric copy of VE-cad on an adjoining cell surface leads to the formation of tight adherens junctions between the cells.
21042424:12	– The antibody E4G10 binds only to the monomeric VE-cad and not to the homodimeric form (the binding region is masked in the homodimers that form the tight cell–cell contacts), thus conferring the specificity for targeting angiogenic and poorly joined endothelial cells in vivo while not binding to normal endothelium or the LS174T tumor.
21042424:13	The alpha particle-emitting radionuclide actinium-225 ( 225Ac; t 1/2 = 10 days) attached to monoclonal antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]G) has been used as the therapeutic effector moiety in a number of preclinical studies – and is currently in clinical use.
21042424:14	– Alpha particles are charged helium nuclei that travel ~50–80 μm, which is similar to the dimensions of vessels within a tumor.
21042424:15	The alpha particle track lengths appropriately match the vessel dimensions, and a single traversal through a cell of a high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particle can be acutely cytotoxic.
21042424:16	Typical tumor vasculature is <100 μm in diameter, and smaller vessels are <10 μm in diameter.
21042424:17	In addition, individual alpha particles are able to kill a target cell due to their deposition of 5–8 MeV in a short ionizing track that is several cell diameters in length.
21042424:18	This highly concentrated field of ionizing radiation may also irradiate the cancer stem cell population that can be found in the adjacent perivascular niche of some tumors.
21042424:19	– Alpha particles are very potent cytotoxic agents in proximity to the targeted tissue but will largely spare normal tissue; it is this characteristic that offers clear advantages to other known forms of radiation as a means of selective cell killing.
21042424:20	We have previously demonstrated the utility of 225Ac-radiolabeled E4G10 constructs to target and irradiate tumor vascular endothelium in animal models, improve survival, control tumor growth, and normalize the vessels and also the ability of the construct to target and eradicate bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitors.
21042424:21	Zirconium-89 ( 89Zr) is now being developed as one of the most promising new immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) agents for in vivo imaging of cancer.
21042424:22	– PET is based on coincidence detection of a positron-emitting radionuclide from 2 coincident 511 keV annihilation photons emitted simultaneously in opposite directions.
21042424:23	The clinical use of PET has emerged as an important diagnostic imaging modality for humans because it provides extremely sensitive, quantitative, and functional information that is different from the information obtainable with other largely anatomical imaging modalities.
21042424:24	The physical decay properties of 89Zr ( t 1/2 = 78.41 hours; electron capture = 76.6%; β + = 22.3%) are well suited for use in the design of imaging agents with extended PK profiles.
21042424:25	Recently, reported improvements in the separation chemistry of 89Zr from the yttrium-89 ( 89Y) target material have yielded a facile process for production of clinical-grade, high SA 89Zr using a small cyclotron.
21042424:26	This process should lead to more widespread use of this radionuclide.
21042424:27	The rationale for using SWCNTs as the scaffold in our construct design is the following: SWCNTs are made almost entirely of carbon, are nonimmunogenic, and can be chemically modified.
21042424:28	– The commercially available SWCNTs have a diameter of 1–2 nm and lengths of 100–1,000 nm.
21042424:29	Thus, SWCNTs have extremely high aspect ratios with estimated surface areas of 1,600 m 2/g.
21042424:30	On the atomic level, SWCNTs have highly regular structures with defined periodicity.
21042424:31	For every 100 nm of length, a SWCNT can have up to 12,200 carbon atoms and weighs 150,000 Da, providing numerous sites (typically 1 in 95 carbons was modified) for chemical modifications and anchoring chemical, biological, and radionuclide moieties.
21042424:32	– SWCNTs that have been chemically functionalized with sidewall amino groups exhibit aqueous solubility and reactivity towards a variety of reagents under mild bioconjugation conditions.
21042424:33	– – The SWCNTs appended with amines and the metal-ion chelate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) were water soluble (~20 g/L) and studied in vivo in animal models.
21042424:34	– Our data showed that these SWCNTs rapidly ( t 1/2 < 1 hour) cleared the blood and prototype SWCNT constructs (diameter = ~1 nm; length = ~300 nm; moleculer weight = ~500 kD) were predominantly eliminated intact within minutes via glomerular filtration through the renal pathway.
21042424:35	Renal excretion was found to be facilitated by the high aspect ratio of SWCNT, which confers lower rotational diffusivity; thus, the CNT tends to orient with the blood flow allowing easy access to the glomerular pores.
21042424:36	Other recent work described the enzymatic degradation of functionalized SWCNT in vitro and in vivo, offering the potential for metabolic decomposition of CNT drug constructs.
21042424:37	– Further, toxicity studies have confirmed the safe in vivo use of functionalized SWCNT.
21042424:38	– Taken together, these data on renal elimination, enzymatic degradation, and lack of toxicity support continued investigation of SWCNT as a platform in drug development.
21042424:39	We hypothesize that CNT constructs can be covalently multifunctionalized with copies of targeting moieties and different reporting and therapeutic radionuclides and, thereby, increase signal-to-noise ratio and be used to image tumor vessels and improve the therapeutic index.
21042424:40	The underlying rationale for this approach is that we are specifically targeting the aberrant and angiogenic tumor vessels and delivering a dose of short range (1–4 cell diameters), high energy (several million electron volts) cytotoxic alpha particles to the targeted area.
21042424:41	In addition, we will report the location of the drug construct.
21042424:42	This approach is novel because it will examine the attributes of targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with alpha particle generators, sensitive and quantitative PET imaging, and the specificity of the targeting E4G10 antibody in combination with the unique nanomaterial properties of SWCNT.
21042424:43	Material and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
The concurrent processes of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation are keys to tumor growth and dissemination and are interrelated by a paracrine effect.
21042424:44	Endothelial cells will expand to produce a tortuous network of vessels that supplies required nutrients, oxygen, cytokines, and chemokines to tumor cells.
21042424:45	Disrupting and damaging the vascular endothelial architecture associated with tumor tissue have been recognized as a viable therapeutic strategy.
21042424:46	– Furthermore, imaging modalities that can specifically target the tumor vessels would be of value in diagnosing disease and following the progression or regression as a function of treatment.
21042424:47	We hypothesized that novel synthetic structures based on hybrid molecules consisting of targeting biologics, radionuclides, and CNTs will have emergent anticancer properties.
21042424:48	These molecular hybrids were designed to amplify the intrinsic targeting, binding, imaging, and therapeutic attributes of a drug construct and should, therefore, improve potency, specificity, and efficacy relative to current drugs.
21042424:49	Irradiation of the vessels associated with tumor tissue was effected by specifically targeting the high LET alpha particle-emitting 225Ac in high SA to the VE-cad epitope; however, imaging the tumor vessels was effected by specifically targeting the same epitope with the positron-emitting 89Zr in high SA.
21042424:50	We previously demonstrated that an alpha particle-emitting, vascular-targeting antibody construct, 225Ac-E4G10, could specifically irradiate prostate carcinoma vascular endothelial cells and also their bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitors, delaying tumor growth and improving survival.
21042424:51	We have also examined 225Ac-E4G10 in vascular-targeting strategies to treat animal models of glioblastoma mutiforme and the colon carcinoma (LS174T) model of tumor vasculature.
21042424:52	Others have also used vascular-targeting, alpha particle-emitting RIT approaches to treat animal models of disease – or vascular/tumor epitope-targeting RII approaches to PET image tumor.
21042424:53	– 
Two particular SWCNT properties, the high aspect ratio and the periodic structure, have rendered this nano-material amenable to being simultaneously appended with multiple copies of reactive primary amines, radiometal-ion chelates (DOTA or DFO), and IgGs.
21042424:54	By amplifying the number of chelates per SWCNT, we have demonstrated a 2-log increase of SA of radiolabeling of SWCNT-(DOTA) relative to IgG constructs.
21042424:55	Each of these SWCNT molecules had ~100 DOTA or DFO chelates appended per SWCNT.
21042424:56	In contrast, an IgG might only accommodate 5–10 DOTA moieties per molecule before losing the ability to target and bind efficiently.
21042424:57	The radiotherapeutic SWCNT constructs, labeled with 225Ac, were also functionalized with multiple copies of E4G10 antibody and used to treat LS174T tumors vs low SA control, nontargeting high SA isotype IgG control, and growth control.
21042424:58	Survival of animals treated with high SA Construct I was doubled after only one treatment relative to the control groups and was significantly better than the growth controls.
21042424:59	Tumor growth was also arrested and regressed in the high SA RIT group 1.
21042424:60	The mice treated with the high SA, tumor vascular-targeting Construct I showed significant tumor regression while the low SA targeting analog did not control tumor growth.
21042424:61	The image of the regressed tumor lesion was similar to the images obtained by Nilsson and Neri who targeted the delivery of tissue factor to the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis, and mediated the infarction of solid tumors in mice.
21042424:62	The increased SA was also key to achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio for imaging purposes.
21042424:63	We have utilized this increased sensitivity with indium-111 ( 111In) and 86Y labeled SWCNT-(DOTA) constructs for PK studies.
21042424:64	– In addition, covalently SWCNT-appended IgG and peptides have conferred biological targeting and binding capabilities to this scaffold and bind to the specific antigen epitope in vitro and in vivo.
21042424:65	We were able to improve the SA of the 89Zr-labeled RII Construct II ~5-fold relative to 89Zr-labeled IgG-only labeled constructs.
21042424:66	Another key SWCNT property that was utilized extensively was the favorable PK profile that featured rapid blood compartment clearance.
21042424:67	The RII Construct II targeted and bounded and then rapidly cleared the blood compartment and the muscle yielding excellent contrast for imaging.
21042424:68	The targeting system also favored this profile as the murine VE-cad epitope is expressed in the vessel lumen and, therefore, is readily accessible to the CNT construct.
21042424:69	The binding occurred rapidly, precluding any need to diffuse into the solid tumor to target and bind.
21042424:70	All of these studies demonstrated that the administered constructs were safe and well tolerated.
21042424:71	The SWCNT-E4G10 construct was tumor vessel specific and targeted the murine VE-cad.
21042424:72	E4G10 did not cross-react with the LS174T tumor cells in flow cytometric or Western blot analyses.
21042424:73	Furthermore, the normal, resting vasculature no longer exposes this epitope to the E4G10 IgG for binding, thus sparing normal vessels.
21042424:74	An illustration of this VE-cad targeting concept using IV delivered soluble, targeting, radiolabeled (for imaging or therapy) constructs in patients with tumor is presented in .
21042424:75	The construct rapidly accesses the tumor vasculature and then can specifically bind to the monomeric VE-cad that is expressed in the neovasculature but cannot bind to resting vasculature with tight cell–cell contacts at the adherens junctions.
21042424:76	This E4G10/VE-cad targeting system is unlike the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-based agents that target the α vβ 3 integrin, which is often expressed by both the tumor and the vascular network.
21042424:77	The RGD/α vβ 3 integrin system lacks the vascular specificity that we designed into our constructs.
21042424:78	Targeting studies of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A that is expressed in the LS174T human xenograft model with bevacizumab were complicated not only by the relatively small numbers of copies of epitope per tumor cell (12E3) but also by the imaging artifact that was created by the lack of expression of human VEGF-A in a mouse model.
21042424:79	The NIR FMT imaging data in vivo yielded an estimate of the number of VE-cad expressed per vascular endothelial cell.
21042424:80	Using the measured values of the moles of E4G10 (3.2 pmol) per tumor (1,208 mm 3) and published vessel area values per tumor volume and VE cell area (1E-3 mm 2), there were 1.4E7 VE cells in the tumor with 1.3E5 VE-cad epitopes per VE cell.
21042424:81	The VE-cad epitope was not expressed by the LS174T tumor and is a murine protein in the vessels of a mouse model.
21042424:82	Baumgartner and Drenckhahn reported 6E6 VE-cad dimers (12E6 VEcad monomers) for immortalized mouse microvascular endothelial cells (MyEND) as determined in vitro using affinity chromatography and trypsinization.
21042424:83	Our value was 90-fold lower than their value; however, it might be safely assumed that most of the vascular endothelial cells in our tumor were not newly formed angiogenic cells, and thus, the epitope was hidden.
21042424:84	Since our value was based on total vascular endothelial cells, then if only 10% of the vascular endothelial cells in the tumor were newly formed or had irregularly or poorly connected adherens junctions, then our estimate of the number of epitopes per cell would increase 10-fold (1.3E6 VE-cad epitopes per VE cell).
21042424:85	If the number of newly formed VE cells was only 1% of the total VE cell population in the tumor, then the value would increase 100-fold (1.3E7 VE-cad epitopes per VE cell).
21042424:86	The latter assumption yielded a better correlation with the Baumgartner data.
21042424:87	Conclusion 
SWCNT constructs were designed, constructed, and used to deliver therapeutic and imaging radionuclide cargoes specifically to the vessels of a solid tumor using a target on VE-cad found only on new vascular endothelium.
21042424:88	The goal was to target the neovessels and irregular vessels in a tumor with these novel nanoconstructs and image accumulation and evaluate the therapeutic anti-angiogenic effects.
21042424:89	The construct design incorporated 100-fold amplified cargo delivery (relative to the gold standard for targeted therapy – IgG) and was built to be multifunctional and thus had therapeutic or imaging cargo, as well as targeting capability conferred by the appended IgG.
21042424:90	This proof of concept design resulted in a construct with therapeutic efficacy, good image contrast, and specificity for the target.
21042424:91	This amplified SA may prove important in delivering potent enough therapy and sensitive enough diagnostic signals simultaneously to the tumor.
21042424:92	Our data also provided support of the use of nanomaterials in vascular-targeting strategies.
21042424:93	These SWCNT construct doses were well tolerated and safe in these animal models.
21042424:94	The number of VE-cad epitopes per tumor was measured and extrapolated to estimate a number of bound VE-cad epitopes per cell.
21042424:95	These latter results along with the PK profile will be of use in designing more optimized therapeutic and imaging studies with these constructs.
21042424:96	Moving forward, it is anticipated that a single construct could be designed to incorporate both the imaging and therapeutic cargoes onto the same platform.
21042424:97	Furthermore, because the construct targets an epitope expressed by the tumor vascular network, a single agent could be employed to image or treat a variety of different tumors.

20108754:0	Indications for assessing liver fibrosis 
It is important to have a safe and effective diagnostic tool for 
liver fibrosis for several reasons.
20108754:1	Firstly, fibrosis is a 
central parameter of the severity of chronic liver disease associated 
with liver morbidity and mortality.
20108754:2	Secondly, fibrosis is a key 
predictor for further progression to cirrhosis.
20108754:3	Thirdly, advanced stage 
of fibrosis is the major criterion to start causal treatment.
20108754:4	For years, liver fibrosis was considered irreversible; however, 
there is accumulated clinical and experimental evidence to suggest 
that this axiom should be rejected.
20108754:5	Reversal of fibrosis is a reality 
in some cases.
20108754:6	Existing treatments, particularly those that treat 
the primary injury, can allow the complete resolution.
20108754:7	When the 
underlying insult can be removed, it may soon be possible to 
offer patients specific antifibrotic therapy to reverse liver damage.
20108754:8	Assessing liver fibrosis is relevant for validation and monitoring 
any antifibrotic therapy.
20108754:9	If compared to other prognostic 
parameters, fibrosis is definitely more important than liver 
inflammation and liver steatosis 
Options for Liver fibrosis assessment 
Elastography 
Transient elastography is more sensitive than currently 
available radiologic techniques for staging hepatic fibrosis.
20108754:10	This technique uses a probe, (Fibroscan, Echosens), which includes 
an ultrasonic transducer, that creates a vibration of low 
frequency (50MHz) and amplitude, which is transmitted into the liver.
20108754:11	The vibration wave induces an elastic shear wave that propagates 
through the liver.
20108754:12	The velocity of the wave, as it passes through 
the liver, correlates directly with tissue stiffness or elasticity; 
the propagated wave travels faster with increasing fibrosis.
20108754:13	A pulse–echo ultrasound allows measurement of the wave velocity 
and the results are presented as kilopascals (kPa).
20108754:14	Stiffness is 
measured within a cylinder, measuring 1 cm in width and 4 cm in 
length, producing an estimated sampling area that is 100 times 
greater than biopsy..
20108754:15	The elasticity result is given as the median of 10 
accurate measurements; results range from 10 to 90 kPa in various 
stages of chronic liver disease.
20108754:16	This technology demonstrates 
many features desirable for the non– invasive assessment of 
hepatic fibrosis.
20108754:17	It is painless, quick (5 min), safe, can be 
performed bedside.
20108754:18	A major advantage of transient elastography is 
the ability to take multiple measurements in the same liver.
20108754:19	It 
provides immediate results and only short training is necessary.
20108754:20	The theoretical limitation of transient elastography are 
primarily mechanical factors that produce poor propagation of the 
wave, including the thickness and type of tissue separating the liver 
from the transducer (marked obesity and ascites), 
the ‘window’ quality (the rib space may be too narrow 
to allow good wave propagation) and some hepatic tissue 
characteristics, such as fatty liver or liver inflammation.
20108754:21	Ziol and collegues enrolled 327 patients with 
chronic hepatitis C in a multicenter study comparing METAVIR 
liver fibrosis stages on biopsy specimens with transient elastography.
20108754:22	It is the largest study of hepatic elastography reported which 
concluded that elastography is a reliable tool to detect 
significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.
20108754:23	Castera and collegues studied 183 consecutive 
patients who had hepatitis C and compared the results of Fibroscan 
with FibroTest and the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio (APRI) 
in their ability to detect cirrhosis.
20108754:24	The investigators concluded that 
the tests had similar value in detecting cirrhosis, although the 
Fibroscan had the single best performance.
20108754:25	The authors conclude that 
liver biopsy could be avoided in most patients with hepatitis C.
20108754:26	Another study, by Foucher et all. was carried out 
on 711 patients with chronic liver disease from all etiologies.
20108754:27	Of the 
711 patients, 354 patients had a liver biopsy.
20108754:28	Foucher et all, 
found transient elastography to be of value in predicting fibrosis; 
it also correlates with complications of cirrhosis such as 
esophageal varices and bleeding, ascites and hepatocellular carcinoma.
20108754:29	The results of many of these studies are shown in 
 .
20108754:30	An alternative technique is to use MR elastography which has 
the advantage of being able to examine more parts of the liver 
including both lobes although it is significantly more expensive and 
time consuming.
20108754:31	Future Trends 
Proteomics, genomics, genetic risk profiling and breath tests 
are exciting new technologies under investigation.
20108754:32	Incorporation 
of non–invasive tests into large natural history cohort studies 
and into therapeutic trials should be a priority in the next years.

This supplement to Malaria Journal meets a great need for a convenient assemblage of existing information on the suppression and/or eradication of Anopheles populations using the release of sterilized mosquitoes
19917069:1	Publication of such a collection of articles is overdue for three compelling reasons.
19917069:2	Firstly, because malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa, where 90 percent of the 300 to 500 million malaria cases and one to three million deaths occur from malaria each year, still depends on only two technologies for vector intervention: indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets.
19917069:3	Secondly, considerable research and development on the suppression of mosquitoes with the sterile insect technique (SIT) was conducted from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s.
19917069:4	However, nearly all of the scientists who pioneered this approach have retired and several of the greatest have died.
19917069:5	While the benefit of the input, judgement and guidance can be provided from current experts in this field, a record of the key contributions of people like Chris Curtis, Ed Knipling and Don Weidhaas has thus far not been assembled.
19917069:6	Thirdly, there are now new technologies available to support area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programmes and much experience has been gained with the implementation of these programmes against major insect pests that could be applied to mosquito control . 
In Europe, north of the Alps and Pyrenees, and in the United States, malaria began to decline in the mid 1800s as a result of drainage of swamps, use of screens to exclude insects on windows and doors, increased availability of quinine, increased literacy and improved education and general increase in economic well-being . Endemic malaria in the USA largely disappeared without the eradication of the anopheline vectors in the late 1940s, when malaria cases were aggressively treated and large areas sprayed with DDT.
19917069:7	Eradication of endemic malaria in the USA probably would have been accomplished even without DDT.
19917069:8	Malaria is transmitted only by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles and in sub-Saharan Africa, most transmission from infected to healthy people is accomplished by three anopheline species, Anopheles arabiensis Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae with An.
19917069:9	gambiae being the most important.
19917069:10	Anopheles gambiae was eradicated in Brazil in 1940  and from Egypt in 1945 .
19917069:11	Also, because most mosquitoes readily enter human dwellings and rest on walls and ceilings, it was found that they could be killed through applications of residual insecticides to these surfaces.
19917069:12	Thus, in the 1930s de Meillon in South Africa had shown that malaria could be controlled by frequent spraying of the walls and ceilings of dwellings with pyrethrins , and this was substantiated by work in India . The effectiveness of such residual treatment was found to be vastly prolonged by the use of DDT . Residual treatment was found to result in the complete interruption of transmission in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Sardinia, Taiwan, Venezuela and the USA.
19917069:13	These historic achievements induced confidence that worldwide eradication of malaria through vector control was feasible.
19917069:14	Thus, in 1955, the World Health Assembly launched the Global Malaria Eradication Programme with applications of DDT within dwellings being the primary stratagem . 
Eradication of malaria was accomplished in due course in the temperate areas of Europe and Asia, in some subtropical areas, the Mediterranean Basin, and the southern USA, and on a number of the tropical islands of the Caribbean , and malaria was greatly reduced in Brazil and India.
19917069:15	Spectacular progress was made in Sri Lanka, where the number of cases was reduced from a high of two or more million cases each year in 1958 to just 17 in 1963.
19917069:16	In 1964 spraying was halted and the consolidation phase of the Programme was implemented.
19917069:17	Meanwhile, newly discovered gem fields attracted large numbers of miners into the previously malaria endemic area who dug large numbers of pits in search of gem-stones.
19917069:18	The soon-abandoned pits filled with water and became the source of dense populations of Anopheles culicifacies the main malaria vector . In 1967 malaria resurged strongly and spraying was resumed, but the dense vector population was found to have become resistant to DDT.
19917069:19	Malathion was substituted, but it was objectionable to some families, required more frequent applications and was more expensive.
19917069:20	Thus, the battle was lost and the incidence of malaria grew to more than 500,000 cases each year . 
As described above, some economic development has diminished transmission, but certain ecological changes, which attend economic development, strongly favour the population growth of Anopheles species.
19917069:21	In particular, water development projects (dam construction, expanded irrigation, production of wetland rice) tend to create ideal mosquito breeding conditions, while mining, industrialization, urbanization and deforestation also tend to shift ecological conditions in favour of growth of vector populations and malaria transmission . 
By 1966, progress in the eradication of malaria had slowed noticeably, and in 1967 the World Health Assembly retreated from the goal of global eradication.
19917069:22	Thus, the people of sub-Saharan Africa failed to benefit from the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (1957-1967).
19917069:23	Nevertheless, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted numerous pilot projects in sub-Saharan Africa to assess the degree of effectiveness of the residual treatment approach alone and in conjunction with mass administration of anti-malarial drugs.
19917069:24	WHO coordinated a particularly thorough large-scale pilot project in the Garki District of northern Nigeria from 1969 to 1976.
19917069:25	This study showed that in certain villages, the intensity of transmission and the vectorial capacity sometimes approached up to 200 times the critical value for interruption of transmission and the number of infectious bites per person per annum (the so-called Entomological Inoculation Rate) reached 132 in one village during the 6-month rainy season.
19917069:26	Even though residual insecticide treatment reduced vectorial capacity by 90%, the incidence of malaria was reduced only by 25%.
19917069:27	Immigration of vectors and humans from untreated sites was not considered to have been a significant factor in causing such unsatisfactory suppression of malaria.
19917069:28	The primary reason for the lack of high efficacy of the residual treatment approach was found to be the tendency of the vectors to rest outdoors after blood feeding (exophily).
19917069:29	Even the addition of mass drug administration at frequent intervals with strong community participation failed to halt transmission, although it did reduce the incidence of malaria to very low levels.
19917069:30	Thus in such areas where ecological conditions support extremely high vector populations, the combination of residual treatment and drug administration cannot halt transmission.
19917069:31	The inadequacy of area-wide residual treatment can be overcome to a significant degree by the area-wide use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets.
19917069:32	While impregnated bed nets cannot protect against outdoor feeding of a significant fraction of the vector population , they do prevent a significant fraction of the vector population from attaining the age of about 12 days - the age at which the females can become infective .
19917069:33	Since malaria transmission can be interrupted only if the density of the vector population is reduced below a critical level, determined efforts were made from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s to develop the SIT for mosquito suppression.
19917069:34	Edward F Knipling, the inventor of the technique, advanced the hypothesis that if sterile males are released initially at a rate (number per km 2) high enough to cause a decline in the wild population, then the sustained release of this constant number of sterile males into the wild population each generation will achieve a progressively greater degree of suppression of the wild population in each successive generation . In contrast, an insecticide at a constant dosage rate tends to kill the same fraction of an insect population at all population densities.
19917069:35	Further, Knipling posited that the SIT could be integrated with the use of cultural, biological and chemical measures to achieve robust and powerful systems of population control.
19917069:36	The initial reduction of the vector population by, say, 90-98 percent, would greatly reduce the number of sterile males needed to achieve a continuing downward trend in the population.
19917069:37	The SIT, other genetic methods and sex-pheromone traps are the only methods known to science, which become progressively more powerful with decreasing population density of the target pest . 
A number of successful small-scale field trials were conducted with one or more species each of Aedes, Culex and Anophele s . The largest-scale trials were conducted in El Salvador and India.
19917069:38	Unfortunately, both of these trials were interrupted in the mid-1970s, before they could be completed.
19917069:39	In El Salvador, the work was terminated by the eruption of civil war and in India by hysteria induced by false accusations that the project was intended to collect data on biological warfare.
19917069:40	In India, the work led by the late Chris Curtis showed that two important culicine vector species could be mass-reared, and the sexes separated (according to pupal size) to ensure that 99.8% of the released insects were males.
19917069:41	Males were either chemosterilized in the pupal stage, or their sterility was produced by male-linked chromosome translocations combined either with cytoplasmic incompatibility or sex-ratio distortion due to meiotic drive.
19917069:42	Field tests showed that the mating competitiveness of the males of both species was acceptable.
19917069:43	However, the mass release of Culex quinquefasciatus males in villages achieved only limited levels of sterility in eggs laid by wild females because of the influx of already-mated females from outside the target release area.
19917069:44	A planned mass release of sterile male Aedes aegypti aimed at the eradication of this urban mosquito from a whole town, was prevented by the political problem mentioned above.
19917069:45	In El Salvador, the target was the malaria vector Anopheles albimanus and the work was conducted by a team from the US Department of Agriculture Laboratory, Gainesville, Florida The wild population was multi-resistant to insecticides (partly due to the agricultural use of insecticides) and, therefore, difficult to control by conventional means.
19917069:46	In the initial study, releases during five months around Lake Apastapeque were successful in inducing 100% sterility in eggs laid by wild females.
19917069:47	Later, sex separation was greatly improved by a genetic sexing strain in which a chromosome translocation was induced to link a propoxur-resistance gene to the Y chromosome, and this was combined within a crossover-suppressing chromosome inversion.
19917069:48	Propoxur treatment at the egg stage selectively eliminated all but 0.2% of females, thereby allowing a doubling of the male production for release.
19917069:49	By eliminating the handling losses in the adult stage, the net release was increased from 200,000 males per day to over one million, and these males, when released as sterile pupae, were almost fully competitive in the field.
19917069:50	Compared with the seasonal upward trend of the untreated population, the releases reduced the target field population by more than 97%.
19917069:51	The immigration of females already inseminated by fertile males outside the release area is a major obstacle to progress for AW-IPM programmes using sterile insects.
19917069:52	In the case of the New World screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax eradication in North America, this problem was overcome by large-scale rolling programmes of release of sterile insects.
19917069:53	Ten years ago, Curtis and Andreasen  sadly asserted that " finding the capital for this seems unlikely for a programme directed against An.
19917069:54	gambiae, which extends over huge areas of rural Africa and threatens the lives of the children of the poor, but not cash crops which accountants see as a worthwhile investment ." 
However, better times are dawning for Africa.
19917069:55	The African Union, formed in 2002 is gradually resolving conflicts and improving social and economic conditions including commerce and international trade.
19917069:56	African leaders in 2000 had strongly committed their governments to malaria eradication in the Abuja Declaration and in their support of the Roll Back Malaria Initiative of the World Health Organization.
19917069:57	Africa has become a priority for bilateral and multilateral development and public health assistance.
19917069:58	At the 1998 G8 Summit, the leaders of the world's wealthiest countries pledged to increase donor funding to combat malaria, and some of this is being provided by the European Alliance Against Malaria, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative . 
There is renewed interest in the scientific community to improve or even replace the SIT through the techniques of molecular biology to make Anopheles incapable of transmitting the Plasmodium protozoan parasite.
19917069:59	Thus, IAEA seems to have been especially prescient in initiating relevant planning in 2001 and in launching a project in 2004 to assess the feasibility of the use of the SIT against selected populations of An.

19917069:61	All Africans and all who wish Africa well have a tremendous stake in the outcome.
19917069:62	Likewise, this supplement, "Development of the Sterile Insect Technique for African malaria vectors", will become available early in this new era when the potential for beneficial impact is the greatest.
19917069:63	The authors of the various chapters deserve our respect and high praise for assembling a supplement, which will have to be on the desk of every investigator interested in combating the vectors of malaria in Africa.
19917069:64	I feel deeply honoured by having been given the privilege of providing this Foreword of a series of articles that seems certain to usher in a new successful era in the epic struggle against malaria, the most deadly and persistent malady of mankind.

18842067:0	Introduction 
Despite our rapidly expanding knowledge of the structure and function of eukaryotic chromatin at the individual nucleosome level, little is known about the higher-order organization of chromosomes . DNA replication provides an excellent forum with which to investigate these levels of chromosome organization.
18842067:1	Large segments of chromosomes replicate coordinately, mediated by the nearly synchronous firing of clusters of replication origins (“replicon clusters”) at specific times during S-phase ( and references therein).
18842067:2	Replicon clusters can be visualized in living cells as discrete foci by pulse labeling with fluorescent nucleotide analogs.
18842067:3	When followed through multiple cell divisions, labeled foci do not mix, separate, or change in shape, indicating that the DNA that replicates coordinately derives from a single chromosome segment  .
18842067:4	Moreover, replicon clusters that fire at different times during S-phase occupy different subnuclear compartments, with early-replicating foci showing enrichment in the nuclear interior, whereas foci replicating later during S-phase are enriched in perinucleolar regions and the nuclear periphery . The order in which these segments replicate is established during early G1-phase, coincident with the establishment of their subnuclear positions after nuclear reassembly . Together, these results support the hypothesis that coordinately replicated segments of chromosomes form stable units of chromosome structure and nuclear architecture that are maintained from cell cycle to cell cycle.
18842067:5	However, the data supporting this model are mainly cytogenetic; molecular evidence for stable replication-timing boundary sequences has been difficult to obtain.
18842067:6	Several studies have found that regions of coordinate replication timing correspond to regions of alternating GC content, or isochores, with GC-rich regions replicating early and AT-rich regions replicating late  , leading some to conclude that replication timing is a relatively static chromosomal feature conserved in all cell types .
18842067:7	However, replication timing cannot be dictated by sequence alone, as both genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are accompanied by the asynchronous replication of homologs .
18842067:8	Moreover, the replication-timing program for at least some regions is different in different tissues  , and changes in replication timing can be detected during the course of differentiation .
18842067:9	These differences appear to be related to differential gene expression since there is a strong positive correlation between early replication and transcriptional activity in cultured Drosophila  and human cell lines [ , ], and genes generally replicate earlier when transcriptionally active.
18842067:10	This relationship is not direct; instead, early replication appears to be associated with a chromatin state that is permissive for transcription . Nonetheless, it is not clear how much of the genome ever changes replication timing.
18842067:11	A comparison of human Chromosome 22 between fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cells revealed that only 1% of this chromosome differed in replication time , whereas analyses of individual genes revealed that changes during differentiation were restricted to a subset of genes residing within AT-rich isochores . Hence, determining the extent to which replication timing changes occur during differentiation is a fundamental unresolved question.
18842067:12	Major cell fate changes occur early in development when pluripotent cells commit to specific germ layers.
18842067:13	Loss of pluripotency can be recapitulated through the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which has been associated with changes in the dynamics of chromatin , posttranslational modifications of histones, and nuclear architecture . By focusing on this specific developmental period, we wished to analyze the extent of replication-timing changes genome-wide to address whether replication timing is a static or dynamic property of chromosomes during the course of differentiation.
18842067:14	Here, we performed genome-wide analyses of three mouse ESC (mESC) lines before and after differentiation to neural precursor cells (NPCs).
18842067:15	Replication domain organization was highly conserved between all three ESC lines and with fibroblasts that were induced to the pluripotent state (induced pluripotent stem cells [iPS cells]).
18842067:16	However, 20% of the genome showed substantial changes in replication timing upon neural differentiation.
18842067:17	Intriguingly, differentially replicating domains in ESCs consolidated to generate larger coordinately regulated units in NPCs that showed a considerably higher degree of alignment of replication timing to isochore sequence composition.
18842067:18	We conclude that replication domain organization is highly dynamic, including its relationship to isochores, and we provide evidence that smaller replication domains that disrupt the alignment of replication timing to isochores define a novel characteristic of the pluripotent state.
18842067:19	Furthermore, our findings suggest that DNA replication may provide a molecular handle on the study of previously impenetrable levels of higher-order chromosomal organization.
18842067:20	Results 
Discussion 
We present the first comprehensive replication-timing study during the course of cellular differentiation.
18842067:21	We demonstrate that domains of coordinate replication (“replication domains”) delineate distinct multimegabase units of chromosomes separated by what appear to be large originless transition regions.
18842067:22	Replication domain boundaries are remarkably conserved between genetically polymorphic ESCs but change substantially upon neural differentiation, demonstrating that replication profiles are extremely stable epigenetic fingerprints of ESCs and NPCs and likely of other cell lineages.
18842067:23	During differentiation, replication domains globally consolidate into fewer, larger, coordinately replicated units.
18842067:24	Changes primarily affect domains with an unusual combination of gene density and GC content, which results in an alignment of replication timing to isochore GC content, but not gene density.
18842067:25	Temporal reorganization and consolidation of replication domains was accompanied by their spatial reorganization in the nucleus.
18842067:26	Replication domain consolidation then, provides a novel and unanticipated concept in chromosome reorganization during differentiation and suggests that studies of replication domain structure and dynamics will provide an important molecular handle on previously impenetrable levels of chromosome organization.
18842067:27	Futhermore, smaller replication domains that disrupt the alignment of replication timing to isochores may represent a novel characteristic of the pluripotent state.
21264240:0	Introduction 
Neuromyelitis optica (Devic syndrome) is a severe inflammatory demyelinating syndrome affecting optic nerves and spinal cord . The detection of NMO-IgG antibodies in the sera of patients with clinically defined NMO but not in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), gave rise to the concept that NMO might be a distinct disease entity . NMO-IgG reacts against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein that is highly expressed in astrocytic endfeet of the glia limitans . AQP4 is expressed in the CNS, skeletal muscle, lung, kidney, stomach, and exocrine glands (for review see ).
21264240:1	In the CNS, AQP4 is the main water channel and besides its abundance in astrocytes at the blood/parenchyma barrier, is also expressed in ependymal cells at the CSF/parenchyma barrier.
21264240:2	AQP4 KO mice are protected from conditions associated with cytotoxic edema like experimental stroke, but do worse in response to vasogenic edema like in brain tumor models . These data suggest that AQP4 has a role in removing excess water from the CNS interstitial space either by uptake into glial cells or transepithelial transport.
21264240:3	AQP4 has two translational isoforms: a long isoform (M1) in which translation is initiated at Met-1 and a short isoform (M23) in which translation is initiated at Met-23 . M1 and M23 possess 6 putative transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-terminal regions and form either homo or heterotetramers .
21264240:4	However, only M23 is arranged in large orthogonal arrays of particles (OAP) in the plasma membrane of AQP4 expressing cells . In an mRNA expression study, it has been suggested that M1 and M23 might be differentially expressed in various parts of the CNS with M1 prevailing in the optic nerve and spinal cord and M23 in the brain and cerebellum .
21264240:5	It is not known whether M1 and M23 are also differentially targeted by NMO-IgG in vivo which could explain in part the lesion distribution in the spinal cord and optic nerves of NMO patients.
21264240:6	Since the majority (60 to 70%) of patients that are diagnosed with NMO according to clinical criteria are positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies of the IgG1 isotype , the presence of NMO-IgG has been incorporated in the diagnostic criteria for NMO . The diagnositic sensitivity and specificity of serum NMO-IgG have been reported to be in the range of 80 to 90% depending on the assay system , . Several recent studies were designed to test whether NMO-IgG, beyond its invaluable role as biomarker, was also pathogenetically relevant in NMO.
21264240:7	The rationale was that NMO-IgG recognizes an extracellular epitope of AQP4, binds to complement, and leads to the internalization of AQP4 in vitro . In addition, plasmapheresis is a beneficial treatment strategy in NMO patients . Indeed, anti-AQP4 IgG1 has now been shown to cause damage to astrocytes in vivo as well.
21264240:8	First, anti-AQP4-IgG1 and complement deposition can be found in CNS lesions of NMO patients . Second, binding of anti-AQP4 IgG is associated with loss of AQP4 expression and damage to astrocytes , . Third, systemic adoptive transfer of AQP4 specific IgG antibodies engineered from intrathecal clones of NMO patients or NMO-IgG serum fractions from patients but not AQP4-preabsorbed serum IgG were able to induce additional perivascular astrocyte loss in experimental rats that had been pretreated with activated myelin specific CD4 + T cells to induce disrupture of the blood brain barrier that by itself was subclinical or only mildly symptomatic , . Together, these results suggest that NMO-IgG might be involved in the pathogenic process of NMO.
21264240:9	However, the lesions that could be induced in experimental animals by transfer of NMO-IgG lacked the longitudinally extensive properties and parenchymal involvement including myelinolysis that are observed in NMO patients unless NMO-IgG and complement were co-injected directly into the brain in a traumatic approach . Furthermore, intravenous or intraperitoneal transfer of immunoglobulin fractions from NMO patients did not induce astrocytic damage in laboratory animals whose blood brain barrier was leaky in the absence of inflammatory stimuli suggesting that lesion development in NMO may not exclusively rely on effector functions of NMO-IgG.
21264240:10	In addition, the generation of anti-AQP4 antibodies of the IgG1 isotype in the peripheral immune compartment inevitably requires class-switch recombination in antigen specific B cells and thus cognate T cell help . Therefore, we hypothesized that there must be an anti-AQP4 specific T cell response in NMO.
21264240:11	In the present study, we tested the immunogenicity of AQP4 in C57BL/6 mice and identified the major I-A b restricted immunogenic determinants of AQP4.
21264240:12	These data might build the foundation to develop animal models for NMO that include both antigen specific T cell and B cell mediated immunopathology.
21264240:13	Results 
Discussion 
In the present study, we provide evidence that an autoreactive T cell response against AQP4 can be induced in C57BL/6 mice and we determined the I-A b restricted T cell epitopes.
21264240:14	While AQP4 22–36 is the dominant T cell epitope, there are other immunogenic regions in the AQP4 sequence.
21264240:15	With the exception of the isoleucine at position 22 of AQP4 22–36, all T cell epitopes are contained in both M1 and M23 translational isoforms of AQP4.
21264240:16	The AQP4 specific T cell response likely accounts for the T cell supported class switch recombination of AQP4 specific B cells and the production of anti-AQP4 IgG type antibodies.
21264240:17	Recent attempts to prove the pathogenic relevance of NMO-IgG have focused on rats as recipients of purified IgG fractions from NMO-patients because rat but not mouse complement binds to purified human NMO-IgG and thus, NMO-IgG dependent CNS damage can easier be shown in recipient rats than in mice receiving human serum IgG.
21264240:18	Indeed, passive transfer of NMO-IgG or engineered monoclonal antibodies against AQP4 resulted in extinction of AQP4 in astrocytic endfeet and perhaps in astrocyte loss . Myelin specific T cell blasts but not non-inflammatory stimuli were able to promote the pathogenic potential of NMO-IgG presumably by disrupting the blood brain barrier.
21264240:19	In contrast, a recent report suggested that upon immunization with CFA alone, i. e. in the absence of a CNS-antigen specific T cell response, astrocyte damage could be induced by transfer of IgG fractions from NMO patients .
21264240:20	However, in all these transfer experiments, the CNS lesions induced by NMO-IgG were distinct from lesions found in human Devic's patients and in particular, failed to recapitulate a vast extent of demyelination . 
We believe that the identification of the AQP4 determinants that evoke I-A b restricted T cell responses is a further step towards the development of an animal model for Devic's disease that would incorporate both T cell and B cell mediated anti-AQP4 responses.
21264240:21	The current concept of neuromyelitis optica is based on the idea that this disease might be an astrocyte disease with astrocytic AQP4 as a major molecular target of the adaptive immune response.
21264240:22	We proposed that there must be an anti-AQP4 T cell response to account for the induction of class switched antibodies to AQP4.
21264240:23	Here, we identified T cell epitopes of AQP4 in the context of I-A b.
21264240:24	AQP4 specific T cell responses were elicited in wild type mice.
21264240:25	Thus, our data suggest that - similar to other autoantigens - thymic deletional tolerance against AQP4 is incomplete.
21264240:26	T cell lines raised against AQP4 22–36, the major immunogenic epitope of AQP4, produced IFN-γ but were consistently also characterized by simultaneous secretion of Th2 associated cytokines.
21264240:27	Accordingly, immunization with full length AQP4 protein induced a T cell dependent AQP4 specific antibody response whose Ig class and subclass pattern was reminiscent of a mixed Th1/Th2 reaction.
21264240:28	Although T cell tolerance against AQP4 is broken upon immunization with AQP4/CFA, it is likely that AQP4 directed immunopathology is limited due to T cell derived IL-10.
21264240:29	We are currently testing this hypothesis in further experiments.
21264240:30	Excellent animal models that include both CNS antigen specific T and B cell responses have recently been developed for MOG as target autoantigen.
21264240:31	Transgenic mice that harbor both MOG specific T cells and MOG specific B cells develop a severe opticospinal syndrome and were proposed to mimic certain aspects of Devic's disease . Many aspects of the cooperation between T and B cells, namely the capacity of antigen specific B cells to function as APCs for T cells of the same specificity, were extensively investigated in these animal models.
21264240:32	In addition, MOG specific T cell driven immunopathology in the CNS appears to recruit MOG specific B cells from the natural repertoire to develop into antibody producing cells and contribute to lesion development by MOG specific antibodies . These data highlight the pathogenic importance of a CD4 + T helper cell response to an autoantigen that is identical or locally linked to the respective B cell autoantigen.
21264240:33	However, with the discovery and validation of NMO-IgG in reductionist in vitro and in vivo models, it has become evident that astrocytic AQP4 may be the relevant target autoantigen in neuromyelitis optica instead of MOG which is expressed by oligodendrocytes . 
The characterization of the I-A b restricted AQP4 T cell epitopes, will now allow us to investigate the mechanisms that result in the breach of immunological tolerance against AQP4 and also why immunopathology develops in the CNS while other AQP4 expressing tissues are relatively spared.
21264240:34	Based on the current results, we may be able to construct animal models in mice that may give us insight in the pathogenic cascade of autoimmune inflammatory astrocyte diseases and perhaps help us to understand how astrocyte targeted T and B cell responses ultimately lead to extensive CNS lesions.
20525336:0	Background 
Methods 
Results 
Mean time until exhaustion during the fatiguing protocol was 80.2 ± 23.4 s.
20525336:1	The mean rate of decline in MedF/time was -0.208 ± .197 Hz/s for the hamstrings, -0.105 ± .111 Hz/s for the gluteus maximus, and -0.244 ± .106 Hz/s for the paraspinal muscles, indicating that muscular fatigue was induced prior to the FRP tasks.
20525336:2	Overall, 5 participants did not present hamstring fatigue while 3 participants did not present hamstring fatigue.
20525336:3	Discussion 
The results of the present study indicate that fatigue of the hip extensor and ES muscles modifies lumbopelvic rhythm and, consequently, FRP parameters.
20525336:4	In healthy participants, fatigue of these muscles led to reduced hip flexion angle (increased L/H ratio) and decreased FRP onset angle.
20525336:5	However, fatigue did not modify EMG activity during the flexion-extension cycle.
20525336:6	Previous data  suggested that ES muscles, in a state of fatigue, were unable to provide sufficient stabilization to the vertebral units, transferring load-sharing to passive structures earlier in trunk flexion.
20525336:7	Alternatively, the present findings indicate that lumbar-stabilizing mechanisms, when hip extensor (gluteus or hamstring muscles) and ES muscles are fatigued, may remain unchanged.
20525336:8	An apparent earlier onset of myoelectric silence in total trunk flexion angle seems to be caused by a change in lumbopelvic dynamics.
20525336:9	Lumbopelvic dynamics during a flexion-extension cycle have been studied in the past [ , ], and it has been shown several times that the first half of the flexion phase occurs primarily at lumbar spine segments with the pelvis remaining relatively fixed, whereas the final half of flexion is accomplished primarily by forward pelvic rotation.
20525336:10	A reverse mechanism has also been described during extension from a flexed posture where initial movement is achieved primarily at the hip level with an increasing contribution from the lumbar spine in the later stages of extension . In the present experiment, it is possible that fatigue probably augmented stiffness in the hip extensor muscles.
20525336:11	Heightened passive tension in the hamstring muscles has been suggested to limit pelvic movement during flexion and to facilitate it in early extension . Hashemirad et al.  recently reported that subjects presenting less general flexibility (toe-touch test) showed decreased FRP onset and cessation angles.
20525336:12	They suggested that when sufficient passive tension values are reached (monitored by spine mechanoreceptors), the central nervous system deactivates the active controlling element of movement (ES).
20525336:13	Alternatively, recent studies showed that immediately following static and cyclic loading of the spine, laxity can develop in the associated viscoelastic structures without neuromuscular compensation mechanisms . In the present experiment, such responses to loading (fatigue task) may have occurred and may have led to increased displacement and tension neutral zone and subsequent changes in lumbopelvic dynamics.
20525336:14	Whether the modulating effect of hip and lumbar extensor muscle fatigue derives from changes in soft tissue mechanical properties or from alterations in neuromuscular strategies remains to be determined.
20525336:15	Nevertheless, although it has often been suggested that hip extensor muscles can generate tension in passive lumbopelvic structures, such as the sacrotuberous ligament and the thoracolumbar fascia , the results of the present study indicate that hip and lumbar extensor muscle fatigue may challenge spinal stability requirements by changing lumbopelvic dynamics.
20525336:16	Repeated trunk flexion and extension as well as lifting tasks have been previously targeted as potential causes of work related low back pain . Therefore, repeated trunk movement or sustained static posture leading to muscle fatigue of back or hip extensor muscles may alter usual spinal loading and stability mechanisms therefore putting, the lumbar spine at risk of injury or reinjury.
20525336:17	Finally, the addition of a load anterior to the trunk modified the FRP response.
20525336:18	FRP onset and cessations angles were increased in loading conditions.
20525336:19	Several authors have reported a similar effect of load positioned either anteriorly or posteriorly to the trunk [ , ].
20525336:20	Such a decrease in the EMG silence period during flexion reflects the need for additional muscular contraction to counteract the increased flexion moment generated by the load, but can also be explained by the increment of total flexion angle during loading conditions.
20525336:21	This augmentation of FRP onset and cessation angles was accompanied by heightened ES muscle activity through all phases of the flexion/extension cycle.
20525336:22	Increased loading of the spine also led to a greater contribution of the hip in both flexion and extension movements, again illustrating a change in lumbopelvic dynamics when stability requirements are modified.
20525336:23	Conclusion 
Spinal stability may be compromised by insufficient muscle force and inappropriate neuromuscular activation.
20525336:24	Therefore, muscular fatigue of the hip extensor and ES muscles may temporarily modify lumbopelvic dynamics.
20525336:25	The clinical implications of changes in lumbopelvic movement and whether or not these changes increase the risk of re-injury have yet to be studied.

19420060:0	INTRODUCTION 
Protein structural data are increasing exponentially nowadays.
19420060:1	This fact has made structural comparison indispensable for protein functional and evolutionary studies, the basic approach of which is to relate proteins according to their structural similarities.
19420060:2	To achieve the requirements of high-throughput data analyses, which are especially common in structural genomics researches, fast and accurate tools are in a high demand to access structural similarity searches.
19420060:3	Searching methods working on amino acid sequence data such as BLAST and FASTA are extremely rapid, though they have long been known insensitive to detect structural relationships among proteins sharing low sequence homology.
19420060:4	Alignment algorithms which directly solve geometric problems in superimposing three-dimensional (3D) protein structures can be very accurate, but most of them are not fast enough to serve as the basis of instant protein similarity search web services.
19420060:5	To combine the speed advantages of sequence-based methods and the accuracy merits of using structural data, many linear encoding algorithms have been proposed, such as those by Levine et al., Lesk and those of TOPSCAN, YAKUSA, 3D-BLAST and SARST.
19420060:6	By transforming 3D protein structural data into one-dimensional (1D) text strings or numerical series, these algorithms convert complicated geometric problems of structural superimpositions to much easier sequence comparison problems, which can be solved rapidly by applying traditional sequence alignment techniques.
19420060:7	Among recently proposed linear encoding methods, Ramachandran Sequential Transformation (RST) has been shown suitable to develop efficient protein structural similarity search tools.
19420060:8	For instance, SARST (Structural similarity search Aided by RST) can run over 240 000 times as rapid as Combinatorial Extension (CE) with comparable precisions in database searching.
19420060:9	Besides, RST has been demonstrated applicable to detecting circular permutations (CPs) in proteins.
19420060:10	CP is an evolutionary event that causes the amino- and carboxyl-termini of the resulted protein variants to be located at different positions of the original protein, while the overall 3D structures and biological functions remain preserved, with sometimes increased stability, activity or functional diversity.
19420060:11	CP has been applied in folding researches and many bioengineering fields.
19420060:12	In detecting CP, CPSARST (CP Search Aided by RST) achieved a speed around 9000 times higher than SAMO (protein Structure Alignment tool based on Multiple Objective optimization) with similar alignment qualities.
19420060:13	In addition, it was proposed capable of serving as a functional assignment system for hypothetical proteins when co-linear similarity search methods failed to properly annotate them.
19420060:14	Although the average precision of SARST is close to that of CE, it is basically a search tool.
19420060:15	We thus proposed that it can be combined with some highly accurate structural comparison tool, e.g. FAST (Fast Alignment and Search Tool), into a good web service, in which SARST rapidly screens the target database and then the structural comparison tool refines (re-orders) the hit list.
19420060:16	The advantage of this combination is that, because most dissimilar structures can be eliminated in the screening stage, there is no need to perform one-against-all structural alignments, which may cost the user even more than a day, to obtain a precisely ordered hit list.
19420060:17	However, to re-order a hit list of 500 proteins, for instance, takes from minutes to over an hour when common alignment methods are applied, which is too long yet to make an efficient and convenient web-based tool.
19420060:18	The situation of CPSARST is similar; even if the ‘double filter-and-refine’ strategy greatly enhances its performance, this 2 × 2 step strategy still takes >2 min to search the current PDB.
19420060:19	For developing a rapid, accurate and multi-functional protein structural similarity search service, we have integrated SARST and CPSARST along with several structural alignment methods, i.e. FAST, TM-align, SAMO and SE (Seed Extension), into a multi-processor and batch-processing system named i SARST (the ntegrated service of SARST).
19420060:20	In this service, (i) the RST algorithm forms the basis of rapid database searching, (ii) refinement engines, FAST and TM-align, provide a high accuracy in the ordering of hits, (iii) CPSARST and SAMO make it versatile since they can do circularly permuted and order-independent structural alignment, respectively and (iv) the SE algorithm equips it a state-of-the-art method to produce accurate structure-based sequence alignments.
19420060:21	The developmental principles of i SARST include (i) giving the user as quick responses as possible, (ii) providing a batch-processing environment and (iii) offering user-friendly interfaces.
19420060:22	When assessed with the datasets in Refs, i SARST well preserved the high precisions of the refinement engines, while the calculation time was greatly reduced.
19420060:23	Retrieving and superimposing 500 homologs from the current PDB only takes 7.8 s.
19420060:24	If the input proteins had been queried previously, the cached results can be regained in a second.
19420060:25	The result pages of i SARST are designed in a way that structural examinations, functional assignments and successive database searches can be carried out conveniently.
19420060:26	Server side programs are modulized; new search methods and refinement tools can be integrated easily.
19420060:27	Besides, its multi-processor implementation system is quite flexible, any computer equipped with linux operating system, conventional C libraries and PHP language can join i SARST as a node upon request.
19420060:28	We hope that this efficient, versatile and convenient web server can be a good assistant and collaboration platform for structural biologists in this post-genomics era.
19420060:29	METHODS 
The flowchart of i SARST can be found in .
19420060:30	After receiving the query structure, the master node will linearly encode it and perform database search.
19420060:31	In the refinement stage, proteins in the hit list are scattered to all slave nodes and then superimposed to the query protein by using an accurate structural comparison tool specified by the user.
19420060:32	The RMSD (root mean square distance) values, alignment sizes and structural similarity scores are gathered by the master node to re-order the hit list, which is output with superimpositions and functional information.
19420060:33	Finally, the refined data are cached in several forms to ensure a quick response once the same proteins are queried again in the future.
19420060:34	EXPERIMENTS 
As a searching service, i SARST has been evaluated with information retrieval experiments using the same dataset as Aung and Tan and Lo et al..
19420060:35	We first found that i SARST exactly preserves the high average precisions of its refinement engines at any recall level.
19420060:36	For instance, at a 85.0% average recall, when FAST is used as the refinement engine, the average precision of i SARST is 85.2%, the same as that of FAST evaluated in.
19420060:37	As shown in to reach this level of average recall, i SARST only has to retrieve 500 hits from this 34 055 polypeptide database, and superimposing these 500 protein pairs by using FAST takes only 7.8 s when 80 processors are recruited.
19420060:38	To know the performance of i SARST when the number of coexisting users is large, we used a number of client programs to execute it simultaneously.
19420060:39	The results indicated that, the time cost in database searching and the responding time of refinement engine rise only linearly as the number of simultaneous submissions ( n ) increases.
19420060:40	To the end, i SARST has a time complexity of O( n ).
19420060:41	WEB SERVER DESCRIPTION 
APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
As a rapid, accurate and versatile protein structural similarity search web server, i SARST provides user-friendly interfaces and informative outputs for scientists to examine protein structures and do functional annotations.
19420060:42	Its modulized design permits follow-up integrations of new searching and refinement methods and thus i SARST is supposed to be a good platform for bioinformatics researchers to test new algorithms.
19420060:43	In the near future, we will broaden the capabilities of i SARST by adding new modules that can specifically detect other interesting protein structural relationships such as 3D domain swapping and non-CPs.

21176243:0	Introduction 
The basis for the thyroid surgery was founded by Theodor Billroth and Theodor Kocher, between 1873 and 1893, that standardized and precise anatomical dissection with preliminary ligation of the two principal arteries of the gland on each side, followed by excision of the gland.
21176243:1	During the last ten years MIVAT (Minimally invasive video assisted throidectomy) was standardized by Miccoli in 1999, and various devices were introduced in order to do a safe section and haemostasis of thyroidal vessels (LigaSure and Ultrasonic dissector).
21176243:2	The Ultracision dissector (UAS) (First generation "Harmonic scalpel"; Johnson & Johnson ®) is a device that uses vibration at 55,5 KHz simultaneously cut and coagulate tissue.
21176243:3	The UAS works at lower temperature (ranging from 50° to 100°C) than electrosurgical device.
21176243:4	The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the actual role of UAS versus conventional clamp and tie (CT) in total thyroidectomy.
21176243:5	Methods of metanalysis 
Results for the Meta-Analysis 
Discussion 
The ultrasonic dissector, although more costly, has gained wide acceptance because it may reduce intraoperative bleeding and operative duration.
21176243:6	Reported benefits, however, were based on some RCTs and CCTs and conclusive evidence supporting either technique is lacking.
21176243:7	We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the surgical effectiveness of ultrasonic vs clamp and tie in total thyroidectomy in patients with thyroid benign and/or malignant pathologies.
21176243:8	From our systematic review and meta-analysis the main advantages of UAS are shorter operative duration ( p = 0,00001), lower intraoperative blood loss ( p = 0,04) and lower overall drainage volume ( p = 0,00001).
21176243:9	The significant advantage of this device is the simultaneously coagulating/dissecting functions, and subsequent timing reduction necessary for conventional clamp-and-tie technique.
21176243:10	This advantage was evidenced by Yao and coll.
21176243:11	in their systematic review and meta-analysis on usage of Ligasure in total thyroidectomy  (WMD = -18.74 minutes in patients treated with con Ultrasonic dissector versus-20.32
21176243:12	minutes in patients treated with LigaSure).
21176243:13	The reduction of operative time has the advantage to reduce significantly the costs of utilization of operating room.
21176243:14	The cut and coagulation functions permit also to reduce lymphorrea depending on ligations and sections, so the opportunity of anticipated demission and subsequent reduction of costs of permanence in the Hospital.
21176243:15	The utilization of Ultracision permits a more accurate dissection and a statistically significant reduction of intraoperative blood loss compared to the patients treated with conventional vessel ligation in thyroidectomy, no presence of advantage in patients treated with Ligasure  (WMD = -60.10 mL in patients treated with Ultrasonic dissectors, p = 0.02, versus -25.13 mL in patients treated with LigaSure, p = 0.26).
21176243:16	The incidence of post-operative complications is similar in two groups (transient laryngeal nerve palsy: p = 0.11; permanent laryngeal nerve palsy: not estimable; transient hypocalcaemia: p = 0.24; permanent hypocalcaemia: p = 0.45).
21176243:17	In the patients treated with Ultrasonic dissector we have only a little reduction of complications; that can be attributed to the technical characteristics of UAS that reduce lateral thermal injury, approximately half that caused by bipolar systems.
21176243:18	The hypocalcaemia is subsequent to parathyroid glands damage during thyroidectomy.
21176243:19	The transient hypocalcaemia appears in 10% of total thyroidectomies, permanent in 1% [ - ].
21176243:20	The transient hypocalcaemia could be also severe and needs to be treated with iv or oral therapy.
21176243:21	The permanent hypocalcaemia requests a long-life treatment with calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues.
21176243:22	The long-life treatment with supplements could have some inconveniences like osteomalacia.
21176243:23	The incidence of parathyroid glands damage could be reduced only performing a precise surgical techniques to preserve blood supply.
21176243:24	In the most cases, laryngeal nerve palsy is not frequent and transient (10% after total thyroidectomy) and can be resolved spontaneously maximum in one month[ - ]; permanent paralysis is very rare (1%) and need a complex treatment (vocal cord injection or laryngoplasty) [ - ].
21176243:25	The prevention of those lesions is of high importance and can be obtained only with an accurate dissection.
21176243:26	The experience and choice of surgical techniques represent the unique cause of hypocalcaemia and laryngeal nerve palsy, Kocher evidenced this problem: "Since we have adhered strictly to this procedure, the hoarseness, formerly so frequently observed after operation, has now become exceptional".
21176243:27	Recently a new UAS handpiece was commercialized (Harmonic Focus) with a tip smaller than 5 mm.
21176243:28	These smaller tips should permit more precise and accurate dissection with a subsequent reduction of post operative complications.
21176243:29	Actually, it was shown from this meta-analysis of the seven randomized clinical trials (RCT) a relevant advantage only in terms of cost-effectiveness (reduction of operating room utilization and recovering) in patients treated with UAS (first generation "Harmonic scalpel"; Johnson & Johnson ®), it is subsequent to statistically significant reduction of operation duration ( p = 0.00001), intraoperative blood loss ( p = 0.04) and of overall drainage volume during the first 24 hours ( p = 0.00001).
21176243:30	Although the analysis showed that the patients who were treated with Ultrasonic dissector presented more favourable results in incidence of post-operative complications (transient laryngeal nerve palsy: p = 0.11; permanent laryngeal nerve palsy: not estimable; transient hypocalcaemia: p = 0.24; permanent hypocalcaemia: p = 0.45), these data didn't present statistical relevance.
21176243:31	The experience of surgeon is the only significant factor of appearance of complications, utilization of Ultrasonic dissector can only facilitate surgical procedure, but can not substitute the experience of surgeon.
21176243:32	It's necessary to do new and more enlarged RCT with new UAS Focus, this should permit a more correct evaluation of advantages of UAS in reduction of post operative complications.

15823207:0	Background 
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) or handheld computers are now commonly used devices in clinical medicine and other professions where immediate access to information is required away from the comforts of a traditional office and desk top computer . 
Several specialities of clinical medicine are using PDAs for the delivery of information at the point of care including anaesthesia , surgery , paediatrics , general practice and obstetrics . PDAs have also been used to collect patient information and improve clinical records, for administrative functions such as electronic prescribing , coding and tracking , in research projects.
15823207:1	[ - ] and in medical education including the monitoring of training .
15823207:2	This paper describes the piloting of a PDA in the on call health protection service.
15823207:3	Health protection is a part of public health and is defined as those public health activities intended to protect individuals, groups, and populations from infectious diseases, environmental hazards such as chemical contamination, and from radiation .
15823207:4	The on call service for health protection varies in different parts of England.
15823207:5	The UK Faculty of Public Health in collaboration with other UK professional and governmental bodies including the Health Protection Agency (HPA), Department of Health, Association of Directors of Public Health and Public Health Medicine Environmental Group has recently published recommendations for the organisation and delivery of out of hours service to protect the public's health . In Hertfordshire, as in many parts of the UK, the on call service is provided by public health registrars and communicable disease control nurses as the first tier of response backed by public health/health protection consultants as the second tier.
15823207:6	The first on call was previously required to carry a large bag of papers containing both local and national guidance on the management of common cases/incidents.
15823207:7	Managing incidents may require the responder to visit incident sites located away from a normal office setting where access to information is easy.
15823207:8	The reasons for developing an electronic on call pack in Hertfordshire were to improve portability by reducing the size and weight of the on call pack and to enable easier updating.
15823207:9	The training group of the Local and Regional Services Division of the HPA has developed a number of initiatives to facilitate and improve the quality of training provided for staff of the Agency.
15823207:10	This on call device may contribute to the effort of the Agency in delivering this function by providing an additional option for those on call to be more effective.
15823207:11	The aim of this study was to develop and pilot the use of a portable electronic on call pack for use by the public health on-call team in Hertfordshire to deliver the health protection function.
15823207:12	The advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of using this system were assessed.
15823207:13	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
We have developed and piloted the use of a handheld computer based on-call pack for health protection out of hours duty.
15823207:14	As far as we are aware, this is the first use and evaluation of a hand held device for public health on call duties.
15823207:15	The idea of using an electronic portable pack was considered good and acceptable by most individuals on the rota and the information was found to be easy to access and use.
15823207:16	PDAs have been found to be useful in delivering information at the point of use in several specialities of clinical medicine.
15823207:17	The findings of this study indicate that many of the benefits of using PDAs in clinical medicine could be applicable to public health practice.
15823207:18	Availability of information is especially important because of the increasing volume of knowledge and the expectations that guidelines will be followed.
15823207:19	Other aspects of the basic functions of a PDA can provide added benefit to the reference function intended in our application.
15823207:20	These functions include the address book, scheduler, to do list and memo . There is also a voice recorder that can be used to record notes for subsequent typing.
15823207:21	There are several advantages of using a PDA identified from this and other studies.
15823207:22	Portability was found to be one of the main positive attributes of the on-call pack as users found the device more convenient to carry compared to the paper based version.
15823207:23	This was the biggest strength of the device given the amount of information required for dealing with incidents.
15823207:24	An advantage cited by users is the ease of access to information.
15823207:25	This has been reported in other studies It would be useful to compare the outcome of incidents and assess whether using a handheld device improves outcome.
15823207:26	We have not conducted an outcome evaluation due to the long-term nature of results of public health measures and resource limitation.
15823207:27	The results of the evaluation should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size.
15823207:28	Ideally each person on call should be provided with an individual PDA but cost considerations are important.
15823207:29	Each PDA used cost one hundred and ninety nine pounds, but simpler versions are available for less.
15823207:30	There was no additional cost for software.
15823207:31	The time of a specialist registrar was required to update and maintain the information.
15823207:32	The costs of the paper based on-call pack included the cost of a bag, papers, printing and time of the person updating and printing the information.
15823207:33	Disadvantages of using a PDA based on call pack include occasional problems with reading information due to small size of the device.
15823207:34	The quality of the information in the pack was rated good rather than very good which means it can benefit from further improvement.
15823207:35	The content of the pack would benefit from an editorial group.
15823207:36	The on-call action for each disease can be replaced with agreed standard operating procedures.
15823207:37	Other areas that need to be addressed before such a scheme is used more widely include the provision of a back up facility and the availability of an efficient system to update the pack.
15823207:38	The previous paper based on call pack contained a large volume of guidelines which made it difficult to comprehensively catalogue and update.
15823207:39	The initial update during conversion of the pack to an electronic format made explicit the need for continual updating.
15823207:40	The most feasible way to update a regional or national on-call pack would be through a web based password protected server.
15823207:41	The administrative content can be updated locally.
15823207:42	The provision of training and good administrative and information technology support will also be essential as reported by other authors . Any support system developed should be linked to local services.
15823207:43	Comparing the use of PDAs and laptop computers in our study suggests that PDAs were more likely to be used because of portability.
15823207:44	Although smaller than the paper based on call pack, most laptop computers are too large to carry around.
15823207:45	PDAs are significantly cheaper than laptops, while laptop computers do not require synchronisation because data can be updated directly.
15823207:46	The use of PDAs is widespread among junior doctors especially in North America.
15823207:47	Evidence suggests there is greater use among younger physicians .
15823207:48	This has implications for use in health protection.
15823207:49	A significant number of future public health doctors will start public health training with previous experience of using PDAs as these devices are increasing used at all levels  and therefore, facilitate access.
15823207:50	Conversely, older doctors may find it difficult to adapt to the change.
15823207:51	Reasons given by older physicians for not using PDAs include the small size of the touch screen typing device which is difficult to use  and lack of familiarity with computer systems.
15823207:52	In a recent qualitative study, McAlearney et al found the main barriers to the use of handheld computers to fall in two broad categories, physical (older age, poor sight and finger size) and perceptual (low comfort with technology and devices, preference for paper or desktop computers) constraints . The difficulty with visualising text on PDAs can be aided by using a larger font while that with data entry can be tackled by either using a portable keyboard or with the aid of a voice recording device.
15823207:53	Further functions can be added to the device to enhance it use including a search function, internet access and data entry facilitating surveillance and potentially contributing to electronic medical records in the future.
15823207:54	The most significant constraint to data entry will be security.
15823207:55	There are software available to encrypt data on a PDA . 
The pack was specifically developed for public health on call staff and general public heath consultants.
15823207:56	Due to the potential for memory expansion a significantly larger volume of reference texts and books could be added making the device useful for all cadres of health protection staff.
15823207:57	Increasing number of reference texts are becoming available via PDAs.
15823207:58	For example, textbooks such as the Oxford Handbooks and the British National Formulary are available on a hand held device.
15823207:59	Several journals and Pubmed have also developed PDA compatible access.
15823207:60	We conclude that a PDA could be a useful addition to tools available for efficiently delivering information at the point of use for out of hours health protection on call duty.

20411120:1	Introduction 
The studies and reviews on the marine toxins are becoming more numerous due to the increase in the frequency and the distribution in many regions of the world of algal toxins that can damage public health, fishing, fish and shellfish cultures, and marine ecosystems.
20411120:2	In particular, it has been reported that algal toxins are responsible for more than 50,000–500,000 intoxication incidents in humans per year, with an overall mortality rate of 1.5% on a global basis . Furthermore, toxic algae are also responsible for the death of animals dependent on the marine food web  . The human ingestion of contaminated marine organisms provokes pathological symptoms that were collectively labeled more than 40 years ago with the term biopoisonings .
20411120:3	Among the approximately 5,000 marine algal species, less than 100, mainly from the dinoflagellates and diatoms taxa, produce toxins .
20411120:4	The increasing presence of algal toxins determined by various known (water ballast from merchant ships, eutrophication of the coastal areas, anthropogenic eutrophication, etc. ) and unknown agents has been called “harmful algal bloom” . Algal toxins may be classified by function of their target and seafood poisoning syndromes . 
Here we report the findings from our and other groups on the marine toxins yessotoxin (YTX), okadaic acid (OA) and palytoxin (PTX).
20411120:5	However, since toxicological properties of YTX and the molecular targets of OA and PTX have already been exhaustively reviewed  , we will focus our analysis on the possible mechanisms of action and target organs for YTX and will summarize the effects that OA and PTX exert on vertebrate embryos and their development.
20411120:6	We describe experiments that have studied YTX effects on mussels, mice and both invertebrate and vertebrate cell cultures, in order to isolate possible biological targets of YTX at both organ and cellular level.
20411120:7	For PTX and OA, we report experiments performed either on invertebrates or using the amphibian Xenopus laevis as a model and the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay- Xenopus (FETAX) as the experimental protocol.

20411120:11	Conclusions 
The general label of marine algal toxins combines very diverse molecules presenting different targets and specific modes of action.
20411120:12	These toxins are currently studied in numerous models and reports of conflicting data are therefore not surprising.
20411120:13	In this sense, the experiments performed in mussels are a good example of different outcomes dependent on experimental and animal conditions.
20411120:14	Several researchers have concentrated their attention on the molecular structure, targets and toxicological properties of marine toxins.
20411120:15	From our and other laboratory findings, the cytoskeleton, a structure finely integrated to cell functions, appears to be particularly susceptible to the mechanisms induced by the different toxins.
20411120:16	However, the large number of organs and functions targeted by toxins such as YTX, OA and PTX should also prompt the adoption of new protocols, e.g., FETAX assay and molecular biology-based strategies, in order to study the influence that these toxins may exert on widely complex biological processes including, for instance, development.
19198665:0	Introduction 
Nanobacteria (NB), bacterial entities with unusually small sizes and widespread distribution in animals and humans , have been implicated in numerous diseases and as infectious agents associated with body fluids, blood infusion products, and vaccines – . These same entities have been linked to the earlier “nannobacteria” found in geological samples as well as fossil forms found on meteorites indicating that they may represent primitive or overlooked life precursors.
19198665:1	NB are controversial due to both their small size (50–500 nm) and marked pleomorphism, features that are currently not supported by conventional microbiology (see ref.
19198665:2	11 for an excellent critical review).
19198665:3	Other laboratories had earlier failed to culture NB as living entities – but some recent reports have confirmed an organismic origin for NB propagated from human pathological tissues based on the presence of DNA, synthesized proteins (some of which deemed to be bacterial in origin), and immunodetection of NB antigens – . While lacking direct evidence, a pathogenic role for NB has nonetheless been suggested for an alarming number of diseases based solely on morphological detection of NB, their staining by antibodies deemed specific for NB, and the demonstrated ability of such particles to propagate in cell-free media – . 
Distinct features of NB include their small sub-micrometer sizes, slow growth, ability to change shapes under various culture conditions (pleomorphism), association with carbonate hydroxyapatite (HAP), formation of bio-membranes, and presence of a protein coating – . NB have been shown to grow in both the presence and absence of serum.
19198665:4	In the presence of serum, NB tend to assume coccoid-like shapes, while in the absence of serum, NB proliferate more slowly but tend to be larger, producing so-called “igloos” or “shelters” with hollow interiors that appear to harbor coccoid-like NB inside them . Alternative mechanisms attempting to explain some of these NB features have been proposed , . In the study by Cisar et al. NB were shown to originate from the nucleation of self-propagating HAP triggered by lipids like phosphoinositol.
19198665:5	These authors further showed that NB, when cultured in vitro without serum, displayed a simple protein profile that differed markedly from the kind of complex coating normally associated with living microorganisms, implying that the NB-associated proteins might have been derived from apatite-binding proteins present in saliva.
19198665:6	Raoult et al. have proposed instead that NB are “fetuin-mineralo complexes” that they call “nanons.”
19198665:7	These authors showed that NB cultured in the absence of serum displayed no more than three protein bands, the main one being fetuin (here referred to as fetuin-A).
19198665:8	Like Cisar et al. they attributed this simple protein profile to the absence of non-specific, steric binding by serum proteins . Both studies exploited the use of serum-free conditions to simplify the protein profile of cultured NB.
19198665:9	The study by Raoult et al. makes significant advances to our understanding of NB biology by conferring at last some biochemical specificity to the previously elusive NB entity and by linking NB for the first time to the biology of fetuin-A, a potent inhibitor of extraskeletal calcification and apatite formation that has recently been shown to form colloidal complexes with calcium and phosphate – .
19198665:10	However, it is unclear whether fetuin-A is a strictly necessary component or “nucleator” of all NB reported to date, including NB derived in serum-free conditions or under conditions in which there is potentially little or no fetuin-A present.
19198665:11	Our own study showed that simple amorphous calcium compounds like calcium carbonate produce self-propagating nanobacteria-like particles (NLP) that mimic many of the morphological features of NB.
19198665:12	NLP formation is facilitated by calcium-binding proteins (e.g., albumin) and other divalent cations (Mg 2+) . Our study suggested that an amorphous calcium compound could in principle serve as a scaffold needed for further calcium-carbonate-phosphate crystallization, ultimately yielding carbonate HAP, considered the hallmark of NB.
19198665:13	We also showed that monoclonal antibodies, marketed as NB-specific and used widely as markers for NB infection, react strongly with human serum albumin (HSA), calling in question their specificity as well as the nature of the protein coating associated with NB . Both serum fetuin-A and albumin may thus be associated with NB, with their relative participation being dependent on the source of serum material used for obtaining NB (e.g., HS in our study vs.
19198665:14	FBS, or fetal bovine serum, in Raoult et al's).
19198665:15	In line with earlier studies that have also shown NB-like morphologies associated with geological samples enriched for simple calcite, carbonate, and silicate phases – our report cautions against the use of morphological and immunological criteria as the sole basis for assigning life to structures bearing resemblance to microorganisms and other biological entities.
19198665:16	These studies illustrate the complexities of the NB phenomena seen with the different sources of material used as well as the lack of biochemical parameters that can be used to define and characterize NB insofar as their formation and ambiguous chemical composition and growth characteristics are concerned.
19198665:17	In fact, it is not clear whether NB represent single or multiple biological entities, but these studies , as well as earlier reports suggest that NB may represent mineralized proteinaceous complexes rather than living organisms.
19198665:18	That is, the NB HAP may in fact be associated with calcified proteins . In line with these observations, the original discoverers of NB have later revised the term NB to “nanoforms” and have more recently suggested the use of “calcifying nanoparticles” (or CNP) instead of NB , .
19198665:19	However, in spite of their questionable status as live organisms, CNP continue to be viewed as transmissible and pathogenic agents of renal and arterial calcifications as well as an expanding number of other diseases , – . 
Instead of considering NB as the cause of pathological or infectious anomalies, we propose that NB may be common physiological remnants linked to normal calcium homeostasis.
19198665:20	We demonstrate here that the same amorphous mineral complexes composed of simple calcium compounds and well-known proteins, that normally prevent calcium from crystallizing, can also behave as scaffolds for crystallization once the same inhibition is overcome.
19198665:21	Accordingly, NB may be molded or morphed by multiple calcium-binding proteins and ions present in the milieu, allowing them to mirror the environment and to vary in composition according to the environmental imprint.
19198665:22	We believe that this alternative concept allows for explaining the entire published phenomenology of NB, including their complex protein composition, HAP coating, and pleomorphism.
19198665:23	Viewed this way, NB are no more than by-products of the normal, homeostatic mechanisms found in the body and throughout nature designed to deal with excess calcium, phosphate and other ions, and these same mechanisms serve to modulate the final composition of NB.
21037954:0	Background 
A stroke is a life-breaking event that most often hits with no warning, giving no time for preparation for a new way of living the everyday life.
21037954:1	It has been established that stroke has direct and/or secondary effects on the major aspects of health (physical, physiological and social).
21037954:2	Moderate and high levels of physical activity have been showed to be associated with reduced risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
21037954:3	Physical activity has not been proven to enhance the quality of life (QoL) after stroke according to the Cochrane review on physical fitness training for stroke patients.
21037954:4	In the same review, the authors state that too few studies have been done to explore any effects of physical fitness training on mood.
21037954:5	Improvement in activities of daily living (ADL) is known to enhance long-term health-related QoL (HRQoL).
21037954:6	According to the most recent Cochrane review on depression and exercise, physical activity seems to decrease depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of depression.
21037954:7	Health and QoL, the two components of HRQoL, have been linked together in many definitions but there is no universal definition for either QoL or HRQoL.
21037954:8	The WHO definition of health is: “Health is a state not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.
21037954:9	This is a well-cited and useful definition and it is applicable for everyone.
21037954:10	There are many different definitions of HRQoL.
21037954:11	According to the Swedish manual of the Short Form-36 (SF-36), HRQoL means a pragmatic delimitation and concerns mainly function and well-being during illness and treatment.
21037954:12	According to the WHO, depression is a common mental disorder that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration.
21037954:13	These problems can become chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her everyday responsibilities.
21037954:14	Depression also adversely affect adherence to treatment for other diseases and is among the leading causes of disability worldwide.
21037954:15	Post-stroke depression is a common complication and has a prevalence of up to 33%.
21037954:16	Data from Riks-Stroke, the Swedish Stroke Register, shows that women are more likely to be depressed than men at 3 months after stroke onset.
21037954:17	Jorgensen et al. showed in their study from 2002 that depressive symptoms predict falls after stroke.
21037954:18	Depression is a common and important complication after stroke but is unclear.
21037954:19	A recently published review by Blake et al. concludes that exercise intervention exerts a clinically relevant effect on depressive symptoms in older people.
21037954:20	However, they do point out a gap of consistent results for the medium-term (3–12 months) effect of exercise intervention on depression or depressive symptoms.
21037954:21	A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed has been showed to have secondary ben efits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post-stroke.
21037954:22	One could expect that many dimensions of a post-stroke individual could be affected, not only the physical part.
21037954:23	The psychological aspects are important for the entire rehabilitation process and for the individuals’ outcome of the same process.
21037954:24	It is therefore important to preserve both functioning and well-being of people with stroke.
21037954:25	Thus, there is a paucity of data from exercise intervention studies, on whether exercise/rehabilitation programs also have an effect on HRQoL and depression in elderly persons post-stroke.
21037954:26	The accompanying paper with the first report from this intervention study evaluated the impact of a high-intensive exercise program after stroke on function and activity performance.
21037954:27	The program could be beneficiary in ADL 6 months after the intervention ended and for the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) directly after and 3 months post-intervention for the intervention group (IG) compared with the control group (CG) ( p <0.05).
21037954:28	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a 5-week high-intensive exercise program (in the IG) or group discussion about hidden dysfunctions after stroke and how to cope with these difficulties (in the CG) on the HRQoL and on the presence of depressive symptoms among individuals with stroke and risk of falls.
21037954:29	Methods 
Results 
The study included 34 participants, 15 subjects in the IG and 19 subjects in the CG.
21037954:30	There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups.
21037954:31	There was a success of blinding the group allocation to the clinical test assessment staff.
21037954:32	All but one participant completed the 5-week intervention period.
21037954:33	Two participants dropped out during follow-up; the reason for dropout was worsening overall medical condition in both cases.
21037954:34	The participants in the IG participated in the home exercise program two or three times per week according to the self-reporting questionnaire.
21037954:35	Significant difference between the two groups were detected in SF-36 MCS and MH subscale at the 3-month follow-up in favor of the CG ( p = 0.02).
21037954:36	There were no differences between the IG and the CG in presence of depressive symptoms as measured by GDS-15.
21037954:37	Discussion 
This 5-week high-intensive exercise program did have an impact on HRQoL.
21037954:38	The CG had a favorable outcome in the SF-36 MCS and MH subscale at 3 months post-intervention while no such improvement was observed in the IG.
21037954:39	This was the only difference achieved between the two groups regarding HRQoL.
21037954:40	For the SF-36 PCS, there was an improvement in the whole study group at 3 and 6 months post-intervention compared with baseline values without any significant changes between the IG and the CG.
21037954:41	The presence of depressive symptoms was unchanged throughout the follow-up period for both groups.
21037954:42	The SF-36 MCS was higher for the whole study group compared with the norm population at baseline and directly post-intervention.
21037954:43	This means that the stroke subjects in this study at this time point were mentally more vital compared with the general unaffected population.
21037954:44	This could be an effect that the stroke patients were still in a stage of recovery and after all had survived.
21037954:45	It may take longer than 3–6 months after stroke to adapt to the situation of living with the consequences of the stroke.
21037954:46	One year after stroke, many persons with even mild stroke still struggle to cope with these consequences, often hidden dysfunctions.
21037954:47	There was a difference in SF-36 MCS and MH at 3-month follow between the IG and CG vs baseline measurements.
21037954:48	The magnitude of these changes was 9 points for SF-36 MCS and 16 points for MH.
21037954:49	The clinical significance of SF-36 is set at 5 points or more, indicating in the present study that a clinically detectable and meaningful change has occurred.
21037954:50	The reason(s) for the difference between the IG and CG in SF-36 MCS and MH at 3 months post-intervention are unclear.
21037954:51	Possible factors may include: 
The main focus of the presently evaluated intervention study was not to investigate the impact on HRQoL and depression but rather to explore the effects on various physical outcomes.
21037954:52	The evaluation of HRQoL and depressive symptoms was done in order to see if an “ordinary” exercise program did have an effect on these kinds of outcomes.
21037954:53	The study was not designed for effect on these outcomes; therefore these results are in fact confirmatory of this.
21037954:54	If effect on these variables, HRQoL and depressive symptoms, are sought after, the study needs to be designed for that as well.
21037954:55	It could, however, be considered as a strength in this study, that the different discussion topics in the CG seem to be of importance for HRQoL.
21037954:56	For future interventions programs, this knowledge is valuable and needs to be added to the discussion sessions in order to have a possible effect on these outcomes.
21037954:57	It is known that the different invisible symptoms such as different cognitive problems are very common, but not often primary will be taken into account during the rehabilitation period.
21037954:58	In persons 55 years and younger, cognitive problems are frequently perceived.
21037954:59	This may be important to absorb and in the design of future programs add these topics to the theory sessions to demonstrate effects on HRQoL.
21037954:60	Regarding depressive symptoms, there was no significant difference over time in the whole study group or between the IG and the CG.
21037954:61	Five out of 34 subjects (three in the IG and two in the CG) had a previous history of depression whereas 27% in the IG and 32% in the CG were on antidepressant therapy at baseline measurements.
21037954:62	This shows that the proportion of subjects in the present study with treated depression is in the range of previously published data on post-stroke depression.
21037954:63	However, the average value of GDS-15 was 3.0 in the whole study group at baseline measurements (2.5 in the IG and 3.4 in the CG), indicating that depressive symptoms were not common.
21037954:64	This suggests that many of the subjects in our study had a positive effect of their anti-depressive medication.
21037954:65	Since the intervention study could have been considered demanding to the post-stroke individuals, both in time as well as physical and mental effort, it is likely that many of these individuals with more pronounced depressive symptoms declined the offer to participate in the study.
21037954:66	The SF-36 has been tested for validity and reliability in populations similar to the population in this study ( , ).
21037954:67	However, there is a debate on some of its subscales, indicating imprecision and confounding when making summed scores.
21037954:68	The results from the subscales of importance in this study nevertheless support the generation of summed scores from PF, RP, BP, VT, RE and MH.
21037954:69	The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is another possible instrument that may be suitable for a post-stroke sample.
21037954:70	The SIS instrument is disease-specific and results in values on physical symptoms, function, activity, ability/trouble in daily life, the impact of the disease, satisfaction and patient satisfaction.
21037954:71	Both SIS and SF-36 are generic instruments, but in contrast to the SIS, the SF-36 is not limited to be disease-specific.
21037954:72	Generic instrument in general, evaluates the patient's general health and QoL.
21037954:73	An advantage of using SF-36 is that it could be used to compare the results with other studies of other diseases using the SF-36.
21037954:74	In our study population, the mean age was 79 years and the vast majority of the subjects had a high co-morbidity with illnesses, such as cardiovascular and other diseases.
21037954:75	It might therefore be difficult to ensure the disease-specific origin of the symptoms.
21037954:76	Therefore, a generic instrument rather than a disease-specific instrument has been considered as best relevant to use in this study.
21037954:77	As has been discussed in the accompanying report, this sample was considered representative for individuals with post-stroke symptoms of fall risk and the length of the intervention program is realistic for implementation in clinic.
21037954:78	Fatigue as a common complication after stroke was also given as the main reason not to participate by those who declined to participate in this study.
21037954:79	Of those eligible for inclusion in the study but were not included in the study, some lived too far away from the rehabilitation facilities.
21037954:80	A few others did not have the time to spend in the intervention program, while some others died during the time between inpatient care and study start.
21037954:81	With these facts, it might be that our included study group is a bit more active than the average post-stroke individuals with risk of falls.
21037954:82	However, many participants in the study group expressed a pronounced fatigue.
21037954:83	In the present study, the mean result of the SF-36 subscale VT (which is defined as either feeling tired all the time or having lots of energy all of the time) indicates that this proportion was higher than in the norm population.
21037954:84	VT has been strongly associated with global ratings of health satisfaction and QoL.
21037954:85	There are several limitations in this study.
21037954:86	The size of the study population is small.
21037954:87	The power calculation was based on the BBS and estimated minimum size of 34 subjects.
21037954:88	To reach a high precision in SF-36, there is a call for more than 200 subjects.
21037954:89	This suggests that there is a possibility for a Type-2 statistical error in other subscales of SF-36 in the present study, i.e. there may be a difference that is non-detectable because of our small sample size.
21037954:90	We consider it a strength to try to evaluate HRQoL and depression, and not only functional and activity measures, even though the intervention study is focused on these outcomes.
21037954:91	It is established that both physical and psychosocial well-being is greatly affected in stroke survivors.
21037954:92	Many rehabilitation programs are focused on the physical outcome of the program.
21037954:93	There is a need for evaluating rehabilitation programs in terms of HRQoL and the presence of depressive symptoms.
21037954:94	It could also be concluded, to achieve an effect on depressive symptoms, that the program should have included exercise that focused on higher level of aerobic training.
21037954:95	Antidepressant drugs may be useful in treating depression after stroke, but can also cause side-effects, especially such as seizures, falls and delirium.
21037954:96	Adding these side-effects to an already decreased functional ability may be problematic.
21037954:97	Therefore, an alternative method as physical activity may be a useful way to ameliorate depressive symptoms.
21037954:98	Ideally, in order to evaluate the effect of physical fitness training on depression after stroke, the participating stroke individuals should be medication-free regarding anti-depressants.
21037954:99	When designing the structured intervention program, the focus of the study was on functional rehabilitation, with an attention time of 30 h during the 5-week intervention program for the IG and 5 h for the CG and actually not to enhance the HRQoL.
21037954:100	The psychosocial part was incorporated in the 1 h/week of education received by the individuals in both groups.
21037954:101	Conclusions 
Our 5-week high-intensive exercise program was related to deterioration in the IG in SF-36 MCS and the MH subscale at 3 months post-intervention compared with baseline values while the CG improved at this time.
21037954:102	For the SF-36 PCS, there was an improvement in the whole study group at 3 and 6 months post-intervention compared with baseline values without any significant difference between the IG and the CG.
21037954:103	The presence of depressive symptoms was unchanged throughout the follow-up period for both groups.
21037954:104	Based on these data, it is concluded that a modified version of a high-intensive exercise program to be tested in the future should not entirely focus on falls and safety aspects, but should also include themes on hidden dysfunctions after stroke in order to have a favorable impact on HRQoL.
15642158:0	Introduction 
It has long been recognized that cAMP is an important intracellular messenger that is capable of regulating diverse functions such as steroidogenesis in the ovary, sugar metabolism in the liver, and contractility of the cardiac muscle [ - ].
15642158:1	In addition to these crucial and specific physiological functions, the cAMP pathway plays an important regulatory role in the development of other complex cellular states such as differentiation, proliferation, and synaptic plasticity.
15642158:2	Elevated levels of intracellular cAMP can inhibit the growth of some cell types but stimulate the growth of others.
15642158:3	Among the cell types whose growth is stimulated by cAMP are thyroid , pituitary , and normal human breast epithelial cells in culture . Several studies have demonstrated that cAMP inhibits the growth of established breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer cells in primary culture [ - ].
15642158:4	However, such studies have not completely resolved issues such as the effective levels of cAMP in different cell types, the roles played by other participants in the signaling web that may cooperate to bring about different outcomes, and any subpopulations of response-initiating receptors.
15642158:5	The intracellular cAMP level is determined by the rates of its synthesis and clearance.
15642158:6	It is synthesized from ATP via a transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (AC), which is activated by stimulatory G s proteins coupled to cell surface receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors).
15642158:7	Clearance is regulated either by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) or by an efflux mechanism that secretes or transports cAMP out of cells . The multiplicity of PDEs was recently established , but the regulation and utilization of different isoforms are experimental issues that remain unclear.
15642158:8	The influence of 17β-estradiol (E 2) on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation was previously assigned exclusively to genomic mechanisms.
15642158:9	However, it has been known for some time that E 2 can rapidly (within a few minutes) induce cAMP production, and that this time frame is not compatible with the multiple macromolecular synthetic events necessary for genomic responses . We have an incomplete understanding of the conditions under which cAMP responses are best measured, and of the participation of multiple enzymes in generating and degrading cAMP.
15642158:10	There are also reports that some MCF-7 cell sublines either do not respond or do not reliably generate this response (personal communications from many laboratories).
15642158:11	Therefore, estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms that increase cAMP in MCF-7 and other responsive cell types have not fully been explained.
15642158:12	Here, we compare cAMP responses in cell lines selected for low and high expression of the membrane form of ER (mER)-α and thus address the receptor subform that is involved in these mechanisms.
15642158:13	Additionally, we further probe the details of mER-α-mediated activation of AC and the contributions of PDEs to final signal levels, as well as subsequent cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation and the regulation of cell proliferation.
15642158:14	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Our studies provide evidence that membrane-associated ERs participate in the estrogen-regulated control of MCF-7 breast cancer cell number by changing cAMP levels and downstream cAMP-activated PKA.
15642158:15	E 2 differentially influenced cell proliferation in mER high versus mER low cells.
15642158:16	Measurements of and responses to cAMP manipulated via different culture conditions, assay incubation conditions, and specific response mimetics or inhibitors allowed us to implicate pathways and signal levels in the mechanism of control of cell number, and to suggest possible resolutions between previously reported conflicting results about cAMP and the control of breast cancer cell growth.
15642158:17	Breast cancer cell lines (especially MCF-7 cells) are heterogeneous populations of cells; other investigators have succeeded in separating them into different constituent subpopulations . We exploited this characteristic and separated MCF-7 cells into populations enriched and depleted for the membrane subform of ER-α by capturing live cells that bound ER-α-specific antibody to their membranes.
15642158:18	These two cell subtypes express the same level of total (membrane plus nuclear) ER . Thus, we have a system in which the consequences of mER levels can be assessed in the same cell line, without other transgenetic manipulations.
15642158:19	Because our mER high and mER low cells were not clonally derived (from a single cell), the differences between these populations that we observed can not be attributed to clonal variations.
15642158:20	Attempts to study E 2-stimulated cAMP levels using the conditions reported by others for MCF-7 cells [ - ] resulted in variable and marginal responses in our hands.
15642158:21	We tested different incubation times from 10 min up to 3 hours at 37°C, and all were relatively ineffective, even in the presence of a PDE inhibitor.
15642158:22	When we decreased the incubation temperature to 4°C, the amplitude of maximally accumulated cAMP increased and the slope of its decline decreased considerably.
15642158:23	Although this temperature is not physiologic, it is often applied for biochemical assessment of biologic responses.
15642158:24	This is done to avoid competition by other biologic responses that could rapidly remove the molecule under study at the physiologic temperature.
15642158:25	We also tested a variety of other conditions, including much shorter incubation times than 10 min and various media, as well as comparing attached versus suspended cell preparations.
15642158:26	Both we and others  have found an influence of charcoal-stripped serum in the medium on cAMP production.
15642158:27	However, whereas Fortunati and coworkers  could not identify any cAMP production in serum-free medium, we were able to detect a low but significant E 2-induced increase.
15642158:28	It is possible that this discrepancy could be due to different incubation times, as we found a very rapid effect (3 min) but the other study tested 15 min as the earliest time point.
15642158:29	In more recent analyses it has become common to observe nongenomic responses that are complete and return to baseline by 15 min [ - ].
15642158:30	In our cells 1 mmol/l IBMX was only partially effective, and loss of cAMP was not the consequence of its transport out of the cells.
15642158:31	We can assume that some other PDEs that are resistant to IBMX were present, unless our mER high cells possess other cAMP effectors (receptors or binding proteins) apart from PKA  that could capture cyclic nucleotides and render them undetectable in our cytosol assay.
15642158:32	The possibility of multiple PDEs with their own individual patterns of regulation provide significant alternative opportunities for control of this important cell function, and add another level of complexity to its analysis.
15642158:33	The impeded ligand that we used in these studies, E 2-peroxidase, was also capable of triggering cAMP accumulation.
15642158:34	The attachment of E 2 to a large molecule that cannot easily enter cells has previously been used to demonstrate action at the membrane [ - ].
15642158:35	Although this compound stimulated lower but significant levels of cAMP accumulation than did approximately equivalent levels of free steroid, it is likely that steric considerations (such as only partial contact of the large molecule with the cell surface; bound protein obscuring adjacent receptors) may prevent ligand–receptor contacts, or that some other aspect of the ligand–receptor complex configuration is disrupted by ligand tethering.
15642158:36	Others have also reported that E 2-peroxidase has lower affinity for the receptor compared with free ligand .
15642158:37	Although it has been reported that steroid can escape conjugates and elicit a response, we removed free steroid in our studies by incubating an aliquot with dextran-coated charcoal under conditions that remove more than 99% of free hormone  just prior to application of the impeded ligand.
15642158:38	The release of steroid from conjugates happens over a much longer period of time than a rapid response . 
We have shown that E 2 can play a dual role in breast cancer cells, both stimulating and inhibiting cell proliferation, depending on its concentration, which is consistent with the findings reported by Lippert and coworkers . We have also shown that the same E 2 concentration (10 nmol/l) could either prevent or enhance mER high MCF-7 cell growth, depending on cell density.
15642158:39	We previously showed that increased cell density can dramatically decrease the fraction of ER-α expressed in the cell membrane (see accompanying reports  and ), and others have observed similar effects on other membrane receptors . The estrogenic responses of mER low cells were not affected by cell density, and their mER levels were already low.
15642158:40	We therefore suggest that this type of control can be attributed to effects on the level of mER and thus the signaling cascades elicited by it.
15642158:41	It remains to be determined whether E 2-induced apoptosis, necrosis, or cell growth arrest could be part of the negative growth effects caused by high E 2 levels in mER high cells.
15642158:42	Others have shown that very low concentrations of E 2 (as low as 1 pmol/l) induce apoptosis in MCF-7 LTED cells , selected by long-term growth in the absence of estrogens.
15642158:43	The resulting increase in ER-α expression levels in these cells caused hypersensitivity to E 2 . In addition, cells in which ER-α has been over-expressed by stable transfection also die in response to physiologic estrogen concentrations .
15642158:44	However, measurements in both of these studies failed to distinguish between nuclear and membrane forms of ER-α.
15642158:45	Because our mER high cells were selected on the basis of their high mER expression levels (see accompanying report ), we can assume that their higher sensitivity to E 2 is a consequence of their mER levels.
15642158:46	Our mER high cells exhibited a biphasic pattern of proliferation, with the maximal growth at approximately 10 -11 mol/l E 2 and the decline in cell number beginning in response to approximately 1 nmol/l E 2.
15642158:47	Maximal stimulation of LTED cells was achieved at 10 -14 mol/l, while stimulation of wild-type MCF-7 cells was maximal at 10 -10 mol/l E 2. Hence, our mER high cells exhibit an intermediary proliferation pattern between wild-type and MCF-7 LTED cells with respect to the E 2 dose–response curves reported by Santen and coworkers . 
Our mER low cells responded to E 2 by dose-dependent enhancement of their cell numbers.
15642158:48	These cells have much lower levels of mER but some is present, and they express the intracellular ER at comparable levels to mER high cells (see accompanying report ).
15642158:49	MCF-7 breast cancer cells have also been shown to respond to E 2 as an apoptosis survival factor after taxol or ultraviolet exposure .
15642158:50	This protective effect was directly dependent on the concentration of E 2, and the highest effect was achieved with 10 nmol/l E 2.
15642158:51	This inhibition of apoptosis was also achieved with E 2–bovine serum albumin, which indicated probable mediation through a plasma membrane ER.
15642158:52	However, these studies did not directly assess the cellular level of mER (the populations studied were probably mixed, comprising cells with both high and low levels of mER).
15642158:53	Therefore, it is hard to correlate their heterogeneous cell population results with our selected mER high or mER low cells.
15642158:54	Whether protection from apoptosis plays any role in the survival of our mER low cells remains to be determined.
15642158:55	Our findings also demonstrated that cAMP-activated PKA activity is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation.
15642158:56	In mER high cells H-89 blocked the decrease in cell number caused by 10 nmol/l E 2, and in mER low cells it further enhanced the already existing stimulation of proliferation.
15642158:57	It is still not clear how cAMP inhibits cell proliferation.
15642158:58	Lowe and coworkers  suggested that the inhibitory effect of cAMP (and forskolin, which induced it) occurs distal to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, possibly by the inhibition of an ERK-independent pathway.
15642158:59	However, other groups have reported that the cAMP/PKA pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are connected in fibroblasts  and in MCF-7 cells . Activated PKA phosphorylates Raf and inhibits phosphorylation of downstream MEK1/2 and Erk1/2, thus preventing proliferation, a counterbalance to E 2-stimulated pathways that stimulate proliferation (Fig. ).
15642158:60	Our findings are consistent with the participation of PKA in inhibition of cell proliferation.
15642158:61	In mER low cells, at both low (1 pmol/l) and high (10 nmol/l) E 2 concentrations, a very low amount of cAMP accumulated.
15642158:62	Therefore, in these cells cAMP's inhibitory concentration is never achieved, although further inhibition of cAMP and its downstream effects (via inhibitors) could still enhance proliferation.
15642158:63	In mER high cells, however, both low and high E 2 concentrations caused about the same amount of cAMP accumulation, but only at 10 nmol/l E 2 did the inhibitory pathway prevail.
15642158:64	This finding suggests that the model depicted in Fig.
15642158:65	is simplified, and that other pathways participate and integrate at other levels, resulting in modulation of the cell's decision to proliferate, arrest, or die.
15642158:66	It was recently shown that E 2 simultaneously activates the proliferative MAPK-Erk (via Src-Shc-Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways in MCF-7 cells, and that both pathways are required to trigger S-phase entry of cells.
15642158:67	In addition, the temporal pattern of their activation is extremely important; a necessary immediate and transient consequence of hormone treatment is MAPK activation, whereas phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation must be sustained for at least 3 hours . Our results represent a unique example of the extremely complex effects of steroid on target tissues, and emphasize the importance of a global approach when studying the proliferative effects of estrogens.
15642158:68	Reports from other groups have indicated that there may be other membrane estrogen receptor types, such as GPR30  and SHBG-R , which participate in E 2 signaling from the membrane.
15642158:69	Clearly, a detailed analysis of different mER levels on the same cell backgrounds from a variety of responsive tissue types would be a valuable addition to these investigations.
15642158:70	Finally, estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells synthesize and secrete growth factors in response to E 2 which can stimulate the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway to induce proliferation . Therefore, comparative studies of the contributions of each of these possible players are needed if we are to gain a complete understanding of E 2-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells.
15642158:71	Conclusion 
Our results indicate that a membrane-associated ER-α is responsible for rapid E 2-induced cAMP accumulation and subsequent activation of the downstream PKA pathway.
15642158:72	A high level of stimulation through the mER-α results in an interruption to breast cancer cell proliferation.
15642158:73	Thus, knowledge of tumor mER-α levels and manipulation of estrogenic compound doses and resulting signaling mechanisms may offer an opportunity to refine treatment strategies for some patients with tumors that have these characteristics.

17485802:0	INTRODUCTION 
Streptococcus agalactiae commonly known as Group B
streptococcus (GBS), is a gram-positive coccus and only member of
Lancefield group B . Originally discovered as a cause of bovine mastitis , it is now a major pathogen in neonatal meningitis  and locally invasive as well as serious systemic infections in patients with chronic diseases.
17485802:1	GBS
endocarditis is thought to be an uncommon manifestation of this
infection and is known to carry a higher mortality compared to
other streptococcal pathogens . 
We report a case of a previously healthy young woman, who
developed GBS tricuspid valve endocarditis after an elective
termination of pregnancy.
17485802:2	This case exemplifies the need for
strict preoperative antibiotic use for abortions during the second
trimester and beyond.
17485802:3	It also illuminates our reliance on outdated
case reports that have historically stated that the rate of
endocarditis after abortion is not high enough to warrant
preoperative antibiotics prior to the second trimester.
17485802:4	We feel it
is time to revisit the issue of whether all women should be
screened for GBS infection and if positive receive appropriate
antibiotics prior to abortions.
17485802:5	CASE REPORT 
A 22-year-old female with two prior full-term deliveries underwent
an elective abortion at 15 weeks gestation at a clinic, 8 weeks
prior to admission at our medical center.
17485802:6	The procedure was
uncomplicated; the patient does not remember receiving antibiotics
or being tested for GBS.
17485802:7	Her past medical history was
noncontributory although she reports a negative HIV test one month
prior to admission.
17485802:8	She denies using illicit drugs, any injection
therapy, or any recent tattoos.
17485802:9	One week after the abortion, she developed low-grade fever and
malaise and returned for a repeat cervical dilation and uterine
evacuation.
17485802:10	Genital cultures grew GBS, Candida albicans ,
and oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus . She was
discharged with 7 days of amoxicillin.
17485802:11	Two weeks later, she presented to another hospital complaining of
fever, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse chest pain
of 5 days duration.
17485802:12	She was febrile with enlarged tonsils, no
evidence of cardiac abnormalities, rales in bilateral lung bases,
and a benign abdomen.
17485802:13	A sterile speculum exam revealed
yellow-green discharge from the cervix; cultures were sent.
17485802:14	She
was admitted and treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
metronidazole.
17485802:15	CT showed diffuse, patchy infiltrates in the lower
lobes with cavitations and no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
17485802:16	Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in chains presumed to be
 S pneumonia and nafcillin was added.
17485802:17	She left against
medical advice and two weeks later presented to our Emergency
Department (ED) with worsening fevers, chills, SOB, productive
cough, and pleuritic chest pain.
17485802:18	In the ED, she was again treated
with cefotaxime and azithromycin for presumed community acquired
pneumonia and intravenous heparin for possible PE.
17485802:19	On exam she was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic.
17485802:20	Oxygen saturation was 87% on room air.
17485802:21	She had pale
conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes.
17485802:22	Lung exam revealed diffuse
rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the right.
17485802:23	On
cardiovascular exam, her neck showed cannon v waves along with a
3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal
border.
17485802:24	Abdominal and extremity exams were benign.
17485802:25	There were no
signs of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.
17485802:26	Her CBC revealed a WBC of 19.3, hemoglobin of 9.6, and platelets
of 81 000.
17485802:27	D-dimer was 4540 ng/mL; beta hCG was negative.
17485802:28	Chest
radiograph showed bilateral, fluffy, lower lobe infiltrates with
peripheral cavitations.
17485802:29	Ultrasound of the lower extremities for
deep vein thromboses was negative.
17485802:30	EKG revealed sinus tachycardia
and right ventricular conduction delay (RSR').
17485802:31	CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis revealed large, bilateral, peripheral lower
lobe cavitary lesions.
17485802:32	She was admitted to the ICU and treated with penicillin G,
gentamicin, and clindamycin.
17485802:33	Transthoracic echocardiogram showed
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 55 mmHg,
right atrial and right ventricular dilation, and large tricuspid
valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation.
17485802:34	Left ventricular ejection fraction was
56%.
17485802:35	Blood cultures were reported positive in 12 hours with GBS,
sensitive to penicillin (MIC 0.12) and cefotaxime (MIC 0.12).
17485802:36	Clindamycin was stopped.
17485802:37	Throughout her stay, the patient was persistently febrile.
17485802:38	Repeat
CT of the chest, 2 weeks after admission, showed improving
pulmonary infiltrates; multiple, bilateral cavitary lesions
increased in size; cardiomegaly with a very large right atrium and
suprahepatic inferior vena cava, along with a severely enlarged
liver suggesting right heart failure.
17485802:39	She was treated with 3 weeks of gentamicin and discharged on
continued intravenous penicillin G for a total of 6 weeks of
therapy.
17485802:40	Although her echocardiograms and CT scans showed evidence
of right heart failure, she had no clinical evidence of this; it
was decided to monitor the patient closely and forgo surgery.
17485802:41	The
patient missed two followup appointments after her discharge.
17485802:42	She appeared in the ED a few months later complaining of chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion.
17485802:43	CT scan of chest showed left
descending pulmonary artery aneurysm without clot or dissection
but clear evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
17485802:44	Echocardiogram in
the ED revealed normal LV motion and ejection fraction, complete
resolution of the vegetation, pulmonary artery peak systolic
pressure of 41 mmHg, a thickened tricuspid valve with severe
regurgitation, and septal flattening consistent with right
ventricular volume overload.
17485802:45	The cardiologist evaluated the
patient and recommended her to followup for a possible tricuspid
valve replacement.
17485802:46	However, the patient was again lost to followup.
17485802:47	DISCUSSION 
Studies have reported rates of GBS colonization in pregnant women
of 4.6% to 40.6% [ , ].
17485802:48	Fifty percent of
colonized mothers transmit GBS to their newborns . For this reason penicillin is routinely recommended during delivery
for women colonized with GBS.
17485802:49	The incidence of maternal
complications from GBS colonization is less well described.
17485802:50	In
general it has been reported to cause benign infections such as
urinary tract infections.
17485802:51	Previously reported serious maternal
complications due to GBS include chorioamnionitis  and endometritis, which occur more after cesarean sections than
vaginal deliveries . 
According to a 1973 often-cited article, the incidence of GBS
endocarditis following obstetric or gynecological procedures is
low, ranging from 0.03 to 0.14 per 1 000 deliveries .
Seaworth and Durack's 1986 article provides us with the most up to
date estimation of the incidence of infective endocarditis after
abortion: about one per million . The pathogenesis of GBS endocarditis is presumed to be bacteremia  following manipulation of the genital tract colonized with GBS . In one small study of only 20 patients, bacteremia following routine dilation and curettage occurred in 5% (1 out of 20 patients);
the bacterium isolated was Lactobacillus 
.
17485802:52	There is a paucity of current studies examining this topic.
17485802:53	In the nearly twenty years since Seaworth and Durack's 1986
article, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has proven itself
to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
17485802:54	One of the
early studies examining TEE versus TTE was in 1991.
17485802:55	It was felt
that TEE represented “a significant advance over transthoracic
echocardiography,” as TEE had twice the sensitivity of TTE
.
17485802:56	The 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines on endocarditis state that “[TEE] is the preferred imaging technique
for the diagnosis … of infective endocarditis (IE) in
adults with either high risk for IE or moderate-to-high clinical
suspicion of IE of in patients in whom imaging by [TTE] is
difficult” . There is a great chance that Seaworth and Durack—relying upon what would today be considered incomplete, if not outdated, standards—missed cases of endocarditis that
could today be diagnosed with TEE.
17485802:57	It is also important to note
that their data looked at cases from 1940 through 1983 and that
echocardiography was not in their diagnostic criteria.
17485802:58	They also
relied upon published case reports in their estimation of the
incidence of endocarditis after abortion being about 1 in 1
million.
17485802:59	Because the women undergoing abortions are usually
younger and have a high potential to be lost to follow up, this is
an important issue to revisit.
17485802:60	Mortality from endocarditis still ranges from 20% to 25%,
down from the 35% to 40% reported from the 1960s.
17485802:61	The
decrease is likely due to earlier detection and improved medical
and surgical therapies.
17485802:62	However, the numerous potential serious
complications of infective endocarditis serve as an important
reminder of the significant morbidity associated with this
infection.
17485802:63	Septic emboli cause the majority of these
complications, including but not limited to septic pulmonary
emboli, cerebral vascular accidents, renal failure, and myocardial
infarction .
17485802:64	Other complications include congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, abscess formation—both in the heart and as
a consequence of septic emboli elsewhere, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and meningitis . 
FURTHER QUESTIONS 
Given the morbidity and mortality related to endocarditis and the
relatively easy and cheap preoperative regimen, should all women
be screened for GBS and, if positive, given antibiotics prior to
all elective abortions?
17485802:65	Certainly, all women at risk—those with
prosthetic heart valves, known MVP, or other risk factors—should
be tested for GBS and given endocarditis prophylaxis .
17485802:66	However, what to do with women colonized with GBS and undergoing
abortions (especially first trimester) has not been discussed
since the advent of new technology.
17485802:67	Current treatment guidelines
are based upon old literature that must be updated.
17485802:68	Information
regarding rates of bacteremia after abortion, rates of
endocarditis after women colonized with GBS undergo abortion, and
better morbidity and mortality data must be sought before the
current guidelines can be safely relied upon.
17485802:69	Prospective studies
are warranted in order to have a more accurate estimate of the
rate of endocarditis after abortion, utilizing the new guidelines
of endocarditis diagnosis.

20922417:0	Introduction 
Myxosporidiasis are invasions caused by parasites Myxosporea . According to National Center for Biotechnology Information, they are currently classified as the Myxozoa and are closely related with phylum Cnidaria.
20922417:1	These are intracellular organisms, which may be localized in the internal organs or on surface of the body.
20922417:2	Over 2,180 species of Myxosporea belonging to approximately 60 genera have been described.
20922417:3	Myxosporeans are common parasites of cold-blooded vertebrates, particularly fishes.
20922417:4	Thus far, only 15 species were found in 83 representatives of the class amphibians, most of them in frogs and toads (Eiras ).
20922417:5	Material and methods 
A single adult Litoria caerulea was delivered to Sub-Department of Parasitology and Invasive Diseases, University of Life Sciences in Lublin in order to diagnose skin lesions observed by the owner.
20922417:6	The animal was bought about 2 weeks earlier, in good condition, and without noticeable dermatological problems.
20922417:7	According to medical history, the frog was in good condition all the time from purchase.
20922417:8	It was the only animal in owner’s collection.
20922417:9	Detailed husbandry information such as cage temperature, humidity, water quality, and eating habits has been established.
20922417:10	All these environmental parameters were generally appropriate for this species.
20922417:11	Microscopic examination material from the lesions revealed a myxosporidian plasmodium containing numerous mature spores.
20922417:12	Morphometric characteristics of the spores (based on 30 mature spores from the skin lesions of the examined frog) were determined with the aid of a light microscope with Screen Measurement package.
20922417:13	The morphological details were established using a differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC).
20922417:14	Results and discussion 
The physical examination of the frog skin showed two types of lesions: a several-millimeter-sized, polymorphic, gray-white cyst with partially liquid-filled content and ulcers which, according to the owner, were the consequence of rupture of the primary cyst (Fig.  ).
20922417:15	The lesions were located on the head, back, and legs of the frog.
20922417:16	During routine examinations, other signs of the disease were not observed.
20922417:17	Spores were pyriform in shape in frontal view, and oval in lateral view, and the average size was respectively 11.4 × 6.0 × 4.5 μm (12.1 − 9.5 
20922417:18	× 6.3 
20922417:19	− 5.4 
20922417:20	× 5.0 
20922417:21	− 4,1 μm).
20922417:22	Each spore contains two unequal polar capsule.
20922417:23	The average size of the large polar capsule was 6.04 × 2.05
20922417:24	μm (6.8 − 5.4 
20922417:25	× 2.5 − 1.6
20922417:26	μm), while the smaller one was 4.66 × 2.04 μm (5.4 − 4.0 
20922417:27	× 2.7 − 1.4
20922417:28	μm).
20922417:29	Inside the spore body, a sporoplasm with two nuclei and vacuoles were seen (Figs.  and ).
20922417:30	Based on the morphology of spores isolated from the examined L. caerulea the lesions on the skin were the consequence of myxosporean invasion from the genus Myxobolus .
 
Six genera of Myxosporea have been described from amphibians ( Myxobolus, Myxidium, Hoferellus, Chloromyxum, Caudomyxum, and Spherospora ) which were mainly observed in the gonads, deferent ducts, oviducts, kidneys, urinary bladder, ureter, gallbladder, and liver.
20922417:31	Only two genera have been described in genus Litoria.
20922417:32	Myxidium and Myxobolus species cause many pathological changes in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and in the gonads (Eiras ).
20922417:33	There are three reports on the occurrence of Myxosporea in the Australian tree frog ( L. caerulea ).
20922417:34	Delvinquier et al. described Myxidium immersum in the gallbladder in 32 species of tree frogs belonging to genus Litoria including L. caerulea . Hill et al. found trophozoites of Myxidium sp. in the bile ducts of several farmed Australian tree frogs with associated hepatitis.
20922417:35	According to these authors, pathological changes in the liver and bile ducts could lead to the death of the host.
20922417:36	Zwart has observed pathological effects of Myxobolus sp. in L. caerulea ovary (Sitjà-Bobadilla ).
20922417:37	So far, only one report has described cutaneus myxosporidiasis in amphibians.
20922417:38	Guyénot and Naville described species of Myxobolus ranae infecting the skin of the anuran Rana temporaria in Switzerland.
20922417:39	Skin diseases caused by Myxosporea are common in fish.
20922417:40	Cutaneus myxosporidiasis in fish are usually caused by species belonging to genera Myxobolus ( Myxobolus squamae, Myxobolus ellipsoides, Myxobolus sandrae, and Myxobolus cotlani ), Spherospora (Spherospora carassii and Spherospora molnari ), Thelohanellus ( Thelohanellus dogieli ), and Henneguya ( Henneguya wolinensis).
20922417:41	It seems that most myxosporeans occurring in amphibians are characterized by little host specificity.
20922417:42	Several species of Myxosporea were observed infecting several host species often living in separate geographical land (Eiras ; Sitjà-Bobadilla ).
20922417:43	However, there are no reports about the presence in amphibian species of myxosporeans occurring in fish or reptiles.
20922417:44	To the best of our knowledge, this case is only the second reported case of cutaneus myxosporidiasis in amphibians.
20922417:45	Location and morphometric characteristics of the spores isolated from the skin lesions of described Australian tree frog do not fit into any of the known species of the genus Myxobolus found so far in amphibians (Table  ).
20922417:46	We can conclude that the present material represents a species not yet described.
20922417:47	We do not know what really had happened to the invasion in the described Australian tree frog because little is known about the life cycles of myxosporeans in amphibians.
20922417:48	Most of the available knowledge about the details of the development of these parasites is based on the disease caused in fishes.
20922417:49	It is possible that anurans may become infected in aquatic environment (as tadpoles or as adults) in a similar way as the fishes, either by oral route or through the skin.
20922417:50	This mode of infection by Myxobolus sp. in the Australian tree frog seems to be possible because this species spends most of its adult life in the treetops outside the water environment.
20922417:51	There are various reports on the pathology of myxosporean invasions in amphibians.
20922417:52	Some species seem to be not pathogenic like Chloromyxum salamandrae which has been isolated from the gallbladder from healthy salamanders ( Eurycea multiplicata griseogaster Eurycea multiplicata and Eurycea neotenes ) (Upton et al. ). Myxozoan infection associated with host reproductive system and gonads reduce fertility (Browne et al. ; Mubarak and Abed ; Upton et al. ).
20922417:53	The most serious symptoms and pathological changes, which could lead to the death of the host, were associated with hepatic and renal myxosporidiasis (Duncan et al. ; Mutschmann ).
20922417:54	Lesions of the skin caused by myxospreans seem to have relatively the lowest health consequences for amphibians.
20922417:55	During this invasion, we have observed only the skin lesions with no clear impact on the general condition of the animal.
21423644:0	Introduction 
Schistosomiasis is a social disease, found at poor rural regions and periphery of cities, with a precarious socioeconomic development, where the inhabitants have frequent contact with contaminated waters, as well no available of adequate sewerage system.
21423644:1	WHO considers schistosomiasis as the second only to malaria in socioeconomic importance worldwide, and the third more frequent parasitic disease Public Health importance.
21423644:2	The main necessary step recommended for reduction of schistosomiasis morbidity is the treatment of individuals living in endemic areas . The program for national control of schistosomiasis was launched in Brazil in 1975, by SUCAM (“Superintendência de Campanhas de Saúde Pública”) – Ministry of Public Health, by means of the “Programa Especial de Controle da Esquistossomose (PECE)” (Special Program for Schistosomiasis Control), which directed its activities for the chemotherapeutic treatment with oxamniquine in large scale (more than 13 million people were treated).
21423644:3	As molluscicide, niclosamide was used, but in lower scale and irregular manner.
21423644:4	Sanitation, safe water supply and health education were also measures adopted, but with less frequency . 
Various early studies demonstrated that improvement of the sanitary conditions and treatment of positive patients contribute to reduce morbidity and prevalence of the disease – . A study carried out in Comercinho/MG, Brazil, in 1974, clearly shows these facts.
21423644:5	In that year, a staff from the Laboratory of Schistosomiasis, Research Center René Rachou/FIOCRUZ, under the leadership of one of the authors (NK), performed the first survey on schistosomiasis mansoni (prevalence of 70.4%).
21423644:6	Census of the population, mapping of the town, clinical and stool examinations of the patients infected with S. mansoni were performed.
21423644:7	However, the treatment of the local population could not be administered as it was intended, due to the appearance of lethal cases in Brazil with the use of hycanthone, the antischistosomal drug of choice at that occasion.
21423644:8	After the discovery of a novel drug – oxamniquine – the researchers came back to Comercinho in 1981.
21423644:9	On that year, besides the above mentioned measures, other ones were taken, such as: identification of the intermediate host, socioeconomic survey, research on contact with natural waters, clinical examinations of the population, and intradermal reaction for this group, besides specific treatment of infected patients . In 1984 and 1986, the individuals that presented S. mansoni eggs in the feces, detected by means of examination of the local residents performed in the preceding year, were once more treated.
21423644:10	In 1988 a new re-evaluation was undertaken according to the same methodology . In 1992, Rocha and Katz re-examined the conditions of the area after five treatments with oxamniquine (from 1981 to 1991).
21423644:11	From that date onwards the Prefecture of the town was in charge of the program for the control of schistosomiasis, and the treatments continued to be administered at the local Public Health Center by local physicians and technicians (horizontalization of the Program for Schistosomiasis Control).
21423644:12	In 2005, a new clinical-epidemiological survey of the population living in the area in 1981 was carried out, focused on the following priorities: identification of the intermediate host; parasitological, clinical and socioeconomic evaluations of the population and evolution of contact with natural waters.
21423644:13	In the present paper we compare the results of the last evaluation (2005) with data related to the inhabitants of the region in 1981, when people were treated with antischistosomal drug for the first time.
21423644:14	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In the last two decades, studies performed in Brazil , , , – , and in other countries – have described the distribution of infection, reasons and frequency of contact with natural waters, as well as other parameters related to schistosomiasis mansoni.
21423644:15	In the present study, we studied a population from about 1,400 individuals that participated in a survey carried out in 1981, comparing the results obtained with the current ones.
21423644:16	Nevertheless, only 358 patients were re-examined, the other ones could not be observed, since some of them moved from the town or refused to participate.
21423644:17	Comercinho/MG, Brazil, was considered as a hyperendemic area in 1981 (70.4%), but turned into a low endemic area (1.7%) in 2005.
21423644:18	Administration of various treatments and quality of intervention measures produced an appreciable decrease in the prevalence of the disease (97.6%).
21423644:19	The geometric average of the number of eggs per gram of feces obtained was 172 epg, lower than that reported by Costa in 1983 (334 epg), or a little higher than the average found by Cury in 1991 (105 epg), both of them also in Comercinho.
21423644:20	It is note worthy that this actual average was obtained taking into account only 6 cases related to S. mansoni eggs discharged in the feces.
21423644:21	Various studies in different regions demonstrated that the intensity of infection varies very much, and that reinfection after treatments in endemic areas show a lower number of eggs in the feces, when compared to the number detected pre-treatment . The rate of splenomegaly was 1.3% in adults in 2005, lower than that detected at the beginning of the project (6.8%).
21423644:22	This fact may be connected with various treatments administered to the population along of 25 years.
21423644:23	In fact, according to Kloetzel (1967) and Bina (1977) , after specific treatment for schistosomiasis, even when reinfection occurs, it can be observed that the splenomegaly rate decreases significantly, and no new cases among the treated patients could be found.
21423644:24	In Comercinho, no new case of hepatosplenomegaly could be detected after more than two decades of surveillance.
21423644:25	The reasons and frequency for natural water contact frequently occurs in association with the socioeconomic standard of the population living in endemic areas, and depend on their needs and cultural habits.
21423644:26	In Comercinho in 2005, the main reasons for contact with natural waters pointed to professional activities, such as: watering vegetable-garden or farming, removing sand, crossing a brook, etc. (44.4%).
21423644:27	The decrease of the related daily contact may be directly connected with the increase in the number of households with water supply.
21423644:28	However, it was not possible to correlate directly the contact with natural waters to infection with S. mansoni in the last survey, since only three positive patients mentioned contact with natural waters, with a biweekly frequency.
21423644:29	Costa et al. (1987) reported that the main risk factors responsible for splenomegaly in Comercinho were: absence of piped water, daily contact with natural waters and unskilled workers.
21423644:30	Scott et al. (2003) showed that many aspects, such as frequency, duration or time of contact, have influence on the infection rate.
21423644:31	Certainly, the supply of safe water at town level diminished the incidence of schistosomiasis, since the existence of piped water in the housings reduced considerably the frequency and duration of contact with natural waters.
21423644:32	In 231 patients clinically examined in 2005, 95.2% presented intestinal clinical form of the disease, 3.5% showed hepatointestinal and 1.3% hepato-splenic forms, whereas at the beginning of the study, the percentages were 67.9%, 25.3% and 6.8%, respectively.
21423644:33	The reversal of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly was deemed as significant.
21423644:34	The importance of treatment and provision of sanitation for decrease of prevalence and morbidity control was previously emphasized.
21423644:35	In Capitão Andrade, a small town in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, Conceição & Pereira (2002) noticed that over a 21-year-period, from 1973 to 1994, the prevalence decreased (60.8% in 1973; 32.2% in 1984, and 27.3% in 1994), whereas the evolution profile of the clinical forms was found to be satisfactory (unaltered in 76.7%, clinical progression in 8.4% and regression in 14.9%).
21423644:36	The reduction of both prevalence and severity of S. mansoni infection were ascribed to the treatment with oxamniquine administered in all infected individuals in 1984, as well as to provision of piped water in the housings.
21423644:37	In 2003, those authors re-evaluated the area, and observed that the prevalence has also decreased (19.4%) in relation to the preceding years, as well as the hepato-splenomegaly (5.8% in 1973, 2.8% in 1984, 2.3% in 1994 and 1.3% in 2003).
21423644:38	They observed that in spite of the significant reduction in the prevalence of infection without treatment at the initial phase (1973–1974), followed by a specific treatment with oxamniquine in 1984–1994, the rate of the severe forms and prevalence remained very high throughout the period 1994–2003.
21423644:39	During this time, people continued to receive treatment, but there were no improvements related to either basic sanitation or potable water supply, only sanitary education was strengthen.
21423644:40	Thus, these facts led to the supposition that the high prevalence and severity of the clinical forms may have occurred due to reinfection . 
In our laboratory, a study was devised to be carried out in Ravena, a district of Sabará, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1980.
21423644:41	Initially, the prevalence of schistosomiasis in Ravena was 36.7%, with an infection intensity of 229 epg (geometric average related to positive individuals).
21423644:42	No cases of hepato-splenic form could be detected.
21423644:43	A specific treatment with oxamniquine in large scale was provided (every four years, three treatments) to patients discharging eggs in the feces.
21423644:44	In 1992, the local population was re-examined.
21423644:45	When the study was initiated, 90% of the housings received safe water supply.
21423644:46	The number of housings with an appropriate waste disposal also increased (from 17% to 36%).
21423644:47	In 1992, the prevalence in the population decreased to 11.5%, and the average of eggs was 60.3 . Recently, the same area was re-examined, i.e. 27 years after the first clinical-epidemiological survey . In this last survey, the prevalence was 2.5%, with an average of 21 epg.
21423644:48	In the age group of 0–14 years old the positivity rate was 0.75, whereas in 1980 this rate was 11.6%.
21423644:49	Besides, 95% of the housings disposed of safe water supply, and more than 80% had appropriate waste disposal either by means of sewerage system, flush toilets or cess-pits.
21423644:50	From 1990 onwards, the population was treated by a physician at the local health center, based on the results of stool examinations and by spontaneous plea.
21423644:51	The living standard related to water contact in Ravena was modified throughout the years, since the majority of the population is no more in the habit of using natural contaminated water.
21423644:52	In the last survey in Comercinho, 96% of the houses visited disposed of safe water supply by means of the public system, 97.6% had flush toilets or cess-pits for waste disposal, and 97.6% of the housings were classified as being of better quality (Type A).
21423644:53	The composition of a schistosomiasis control program varies according to two approaches: 1.
21423644:54	Control of morbidity, aiming at reducing the number of severe form of the disease; 2.
21423644:55	Control of transmission, by interrupting the evolutive cycle of the parasite.
21423644:56	In the first case, the control of morbidity is specially undertaken by using chemotherapy, whereas the control of transmission requires treatment, safe water supply and appropriate waste disposal, environmental sanitation, and health education . 
Currently, in Comercinho, low prevalence rate regarding the population in general and in previously treated individuals, low frequency of cases with hepatosplenic form, have clearly proved that control measures in association can led to interruption or significant decrease of transmission.
21423644:57	At least, this clearly happens in Ravena and Comercinho.
21423644:58	Finally, due to the effectiveness of the measures above mentioned, it is quite clear that the Brazilian Government should adopted the association of control measures mentioned in this study in order to attain schistosomiasis transmission control in the country.
20652455:0	Introduction 
In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the problems of reading disabled (RD) children and children with specific language impairment (SLI) in speech perception (e.g., Godfrey, Syrdal-Lasky, Millay, & Knox, ; Joanisse, Manis, Keating, & Seidenberg, ; Manis et al., ; Mody, ; Mody, Studdert-Kennedy, & Brady, ; Nittrouer, ; Reed, ; Rosen, ; Serniclaes, Sprenger-Charolles, Carre, & Démonet, ; Serniclaes, Van Heghe, Mousty, Carré, & Sprenger-Charolles, ; Studdert-Kennedy, ; Tallal, ).
20652455:1	Although there is a lot of controversy in the field, Rosen suggested in a review of the literature that, rather than a general auditory deficit, the deficit underlying RD is most likely linguistic and phonological in nature and that acoustic complexity should be taken into account (but see Richardson et al., for a recent account of a nonspeech-specific mechanism).
20652455:2	In the current study, we therefore focus on phonological processing and natural speech perception while specifically comparing acoustic contrasts.
20652455:3	We selected children with reading problems (reading disabled) rather than children who have SLI.
20652455:4	There is an abundant amount of evidence to suggest that reading problems are due to a phonological deficit (see for reviews Hulme & Snowling, ; Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, ).
20652455:5	This deficit encompasses problems in phonological awareness, short-tem memory, and possibly rapid automatized naming.
20652455:6	The phonological deficit is often believed to be due to a problem in the specification of phonological representations.
20652455:7	In turn, poor speech perception has been argued to be at the basis of the phonological deficit, as it might hamper the buildup of high-quality phonological representations (e.g., Hulme & Snowling, ; Studdert-Kennedy, ).
20652455:8	Finally, it has been argued (e.g., Mody, ) that speech perception problems are due to poorly defined phonological categories that may directly lead to problems in phonological awareness.
20652455:9	It has been argued that, in orthographically transparent languages, with their relatively more consistent connections between letters and sounds than in English, RD children’s problems in phonological awareness tasks might be short-lived and are only manifest in the beginning of learning to read (e.g., Landerl & Wimmer, ; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, ).
20652455:10	Due to the transparency of the orthography, even dyslexic children can develop adequate phonological awareness.
20652455:11	Indeed in a longitudinal study, de Jong & van der Leij found that, at the end of first grade, Dutch RD children performed worse than normal readers on a phonological awareness task (first and last sound categorization), but this difference had disappeared by the end of sixth grade.
20652455:12	However, in an additional study using a nonword phoneme-deletion task, it appeared that fourth graders with RD could delete a phoneme from a one-syllable nonword but had problems in the deletion of a phoneme from a more complex two-syllable nonword.
20652455:13	de Jong and van der Leij argued that dyslexic children learning to read in a transparent orthography have access to phonemes in spoken words as simple phonological awareness tasks showed no deficit, but evidently this access is fragile or insecure as a more complex phonological awareness task poses major problems.
20652455:14	Such fragile or insecure access to phonemes may hamper speeded word recognition.
20652455:15	Slow word recognition is the major characteristic of dyslexia in transparent orthographies (e.g., de Jong & van der Leij, ; Ziegler & Goswami, ).
20652455:16	It has, for example, been suggested that normal reading children learning to read in German, Dutch, or Italian, all relatively transparent orthographies, rely mainly on highly efficient sublexical recoding at the level of grapheme–phoneme correspondences (Martens & de Jong, ; Spinelli et al., ; Ziegler & Goswami, ).
20652455:17	Without efficient access to phonemes, sublexical recoding may proceed very slowly with a resulting lack of fluency in reading.
20652455:18	Accurate and rapid access to the phonemes in phonological representations seems needed for such an efficient process.
20652455:19	To determine whether insecure access to phonemes may be an underlying factor for the reading fluency problems in transparent languages, the current study will focus on both speech perception accuracy and speed.
20652455:20	Examining not just accuracy but also speed of speech perception seems especially important in transparent orthographies like Dutch where lack of reading speed is the defining feature of RD.
20652455:21	The relationship between speech perception accuracy and reading disability has been studied extensively, yet research into the relationship between speed of speech perception and reading is still lacking.
20652455:22	Tallal argued that speech perception problems in children with RD or SLI are due to the rapidly changing acoustic spectra involved.
20652455:23	Auditory memory representations for stop consonants may be less strong because their distinctive cues are of brief duration and they involve fast transitions in the speech signal (e.g., Crowder, ).
20652455:24	In contrast, Studdert-Kennedy argued that the problems may well arise because the elements contrasted are acoustically very similar and have to be distinguished from one another under time pressure.
20652455:25	Adlard and Hazan looked at the accuracy of 9–12-year-old children on perceptual tests involving speech and nonspeech sounds.
20652455:26	They found no differences between groups on any of the psychoacoustic tests of auditory acuity on nonspeech sounds, providing no support for a general auditory processing deficit (see also Breznitz & Meyler, ; Farmer & Klein, ; Heiervang, Stevenson, & Hugdahl, ; Talcott, Gram, Van Ingelghem, Witton, Stein, & Toennessen, ).
20652455:27	By contrast and in line with Studdert-Kennedy’s view, all groups made more errors when speech sounds differed by small degrees, suggesting that similarity complicated accurate perception for all children.
20652455:28	Research that has investigated the speech perception of reading disabled children has mainly focused on contrasts between stop consonants (Godfrey et al., ; Joanisse et al., ; Maassen, Groenen, Crul, Assman-Hulsmans, & Gabreëls, ; Manis et al., ). These studies used a place-of-articulation (e.g., ) or voicing continuum (e.g., ) between a limited set of stop consonants.
20652455:29	Stop consonants have been chosen because they are assumed to be particularly problematic in view of the fast transitions involved.
20652455:30	Most studies to date have focused on a restricted number of contrasts between stop consonants, using phonemes that differed from each other by small and equal steps on a single acoustic dimension, creating a continuum between two endpoints (either natural or artificial speech).
20652455:31	Stop consonants in these studies often differed on only one phonetic feature that was manipulated (e.g., on a voicing continuum).
20652455:32	Speech continua are an interesting approach to indicate whether problems exist in speech perception and the contrasts between sounds can be carefully manipulated.
20652455:33	In addition, they provide important information on the perception of ambiguous phones in connected speech.
20652455:34	However, this paradigm can only be used with a restricted set of sounds, and its main focus is not on the endpoints that occur in natural language.
20652455:35	Consequently, it is worthwhile to supplement these studies by research that investigates whether RD children have problems in the perception of the diverse set of sounds they encounter in natural language.
20652455:36	To date, there have been few studies that have investigated natural speech, and those that exist had a sole focus on accuracy.
20652455:37	Adlard and Hazan used natural language contrasts to examine speech perception accuracy in English RD children.
20652455:38	Their study involved 13 RD children, 12 reading age-, and 12 chronological age (CA)-matched controls who were between 9 and 12 years old, had English as their mother tongue, suffered no emotional problems, and had no earlier or current problems with speech production.
20652455:39	On a phoneme discrimination task with real words (e.g., ), RD children had more errors than reading and CA controls, but these errors were not limited to stop consonant contrasts.
20652455:40	RD children’s problems in speech perception appeared more general and not only due to fast transitions.
20652455:41	All children had higher error rates when pairs differed in one phonetic feature (place of articulation, e.g., /spill/ -/still/) than when three features (voicing, manner, and place of articulation, e.g., /spot/-/slot/) differed, suggesting that phonetic similarity created accuracy problems in speech perception for all children.
20652455:42	On a VCV discrimination task with pseudowords (e.g., ), RD children, however, had more errors on stop consonant contrasts.
20652455:43	Error rates on other consonant contrasts (fricative, nasal, and approximant contrasts) also appeared higher in the RD group, yet these differences were not significant.
20652455:44	It has to be noted that all contrasts in this task differed on one phonetic feature only, so that errors may only have been caused by phonetic similarity.
20652455:45	Further analysis also revealed that only a subgroup (four out of 13) of the RD children was responsible for the lower accuracy scores on the speech discrimination tests.
20652455:46	Although Adlard and Hazan’s data demonstrate that phonetic similarity can complicate accurate perception, the issue of the interaction with stop consonants remains unresolved.
20652455:47	According to Adlard and Hazan, errors were not limited to contrasts marked by fast transitions but were also due to phonetic similarity (differences on one feature).
20652455:48	Similarly, in a study by Treiman, Broderick, Tincoff, & Rodriguez, it was found that, for preschoolers and kindergarten children, stops were not more difficult to recognize than fricative consonants.
20652455:49	In view of the contradicting results, further research into the perception of stop consonants in natural speech seems warranted.
20652455:50	Currently, in most studies, contrasts have been examined in simple CV or CVC words.
20652455:51	However, it seems important whether the consonant is part of a cluster.
20652455:52	In Dutch, for example, there is evidence that RD children continue to have problems in reading words with consonant clusters (Struiksma, ), despite intensive and focused instruction.
20652455:53	In English, initial consonant clusters are difficult to spell for some children beginning to read, with most errors being due to the omission of the second consonant (e.g., Treiman, ), but these problems appear transitory.
20652455:54	In the study by Treiman, some children omitted the consonants in second position.
20652455:55	In contrast, the first consonant was rarely dropped.
20652455:56	Children also had to name pictures and were then asked whether the name contained the target letter.
20652455:57	When the consonant was the second in a consonant cluster, children had less correct detections than for that same consonant outside a cluster.
20652455:58	In addition, second-grade children made more spelling errors on CCVC words than older children (Steffler, Varnhagen, Friesen, & Treiman, ), and very young children had difficulty in pronouncing initial consonant clusters (Treiman & Weatherston, ).
20652455:59	For Dutch, it has been shown that isolating initial phonemes was more difficult in consonant clusters (Schreuder & Van Bon, ).
20652455:60	It was further shown that dyslexics had more errors than regular readers in auditory recognition of target phonemes, but the pattern of errors was similar to that of regular readers, with nonwords containing consonant clusters being especially problematic (Bruck & Treiman, ).
20652455:61	Research into speech perception of consonant clusters may indicate whether problems in reading consonant clusters that persist despite intervention stem from slow speed of speech perception.
20652455:62	In the study by Struiksma, reading problems were most apparent when children were required to read words beginning with the same consonant cluster but followed by different vowels (e.g., f - k - k [‘bark’- ‘can’ - ‘block’]).
20652455:63	Switching between vowels in CCV sequences complicated the reading task.
20652455:64	This finding might be explained by the fact that, in articulating the words while reading, one speech segment influences the articulation of another (coarticulation, see Daniloff & Hammarberg, ), so that stop consonants have to be identified on the basis of neighboring vowel transitions (e.g., Pols & Schouten, ).
20652455:65	As a result, even though the spelling of the consonant cluster sounds in the Struiksma study was identical, their acoustic properties changed whenever a different vowel followed, thereby increasing task demands.
20652455:66	Because reading fluency problems are the main characteristic of poor readers in an orthographically transparent language like Dutch, research into their speech perception problems should take speed measures into account.
20652455:67	In addition, research is needed to clarify whether differences between RD children and CA controls were due to fast transitions or to phonetic similarity.
20652455:68	In the current study, we first examined differences between RD children and their normal reading peers in the perception of natural occurring speech contrasts instead of the in-between sounds that are used in continua studies.
20652455:69	In addition to single consonants, we also examined consonants within consonant clusters, as we expected the perception of consonants in consonant clusters to be more difficult than the perception of single consonants for RD children, especially when stop consonants were involved.
20652455:70	We predicted the RD children to have specific problems in the fluent perception of stop consonants.
20652455:71	Problems in speech perception have either been ascribed to fast transitions involved in stop consonants or, alternatively, to similarity between different speech sounds.
20652455:72	In an additional analysis, we therefore specifically focused on phonetic similarity.
20652455:73	If fast transitions in the auditory signal caused perceptual difficulties, contrasts between different stop consonants involving fast transitions would be more difficult for RD children than contrasts between nonstop consonants as the latter do not have fast transitions.
20652455:74	In research on speech perception, contrasts between stop consonants are used because they involve fast transitions in the speech signal.
20652455:75	However, there is often the theoretical confound that two stop consonants do not only involve fast transitions but are also phonetically similar.
20652455:76	To examine the importance of fast transitions, phonetic similarity needs to be controlled for.
20652455:77	We compared stop contrasts that differed on one phonetic feature (place of articulation) with fricative contrasts that differed on one phonetic feature (place of articulation).
20652455:78	To examine similarity, we compared stop and fricative contrasts that differed on one phonetic feature (place of articulation) with contrasts that differed on more phonetic features (e.g., voicing, place, and manner of articulation).
20652455:79	This approach enabled us to disentangle the influence of fast transitions (stop consonants) and phonetic similarity (number of different phonetic features).
20652455:80	Under the similarity hypothesis, discriminating between two similar sounds (only one phonetic feature different) had to be more difficult for RD children than discriminating between sounds differing on more phonetic features.
20652455:81	In contrast, if fast transitions were a problem for RD children and not just similarity, stop consonant contrasts would be more difficult than fricative contrasts, even though both differed only on one phonetic feature.
20652455:82	Our aim was to select children who were in the process of learning to read monosyllabic words with initial double consonants.
20652455:83	In a recent paper by McArthur & Bishop, they argued that age might be important because an auditory processing deficit might disappear with age, possibly before the age of 9.
20652455:84	Abnormal auditory processing could have negative effects on speech discrimination.
20652455:85	It is therefore interesting to establish whether speech discrimination in young RD children is already problematic.
20652455:86	By selecting beginning readers, we also hoped to limit effects of reading skill on speech perception.
20652455:87	This is important because differences in speech perception could be the result of reading skill differences instead of a causal factor, a possibility that has been suggested by Serniclaes and his colleagues (Serniclaes et al., ). There is evidence that orthography started to influence auditory language tasks in later elementary grades (Ehri & Wilce, ) and that reading instruction changed phonological representations for words (Ziegler & Goswami, ).
20652455:88	Because reading ability is prone to change at this young age, we used a selection procedure involving repeated testing of reading to make sure that apparent reading problems were not just temporary but persistent.
20652455:89	Children were first screened for reading problems 3–5 months before the study.
20652455:90	Second, their reading skills were tested at the time of the study, in the same test session that our speech perception measures were administered.
20652455:91	Finally, the reading test was administered a year after the study to determine whether they still had reading problems.
20652455:92	In sum, the aim of the current study was to answer the following questions:
 
Method 
Results 
In the first section, we will provide evidence on our first three research questions.
20652455:93	We will present results on speed and accuracy deficits in identifying and discriminating speech contrasts, the perception of stop consonants in comparison to nonstop consonants, and the perception of consonants in consonant clusters in comparison to their perception as a single consonant.
20652455:94	In the second section, we will answer our fourth question and focus on the perception of stop consonants in comparison to nonstop consonants while specifically controlling for phonetic similarity.
20652455:95	Discussion 
In this study, we compared differences in the perception of natural speech contrasts between young children with persistent reading problems and their normal reading peers.
20652455:96	Our results provided no evidence that reading disabled children had accuracy deficits in identifying and discriminating speech contrasts.
20652455:97	In contrast, the present study showed that, when processing time was taken into account, RD children appear to have speed problems in identifying sounds rather than in discriminating sounds, suggesting a deficit in automatic access to phonetic representations.
20652455:98	Consonant clusters were not slower or less accurately perceived than nonclusters, neither for RD children nor for controls.
20652455:99	As to the difficulty of stop consonants, stop consonants were not processed slower, yet an unexpected finding was that stop consonants seemed more accurate for all children.
20652455:100	However, this difference disappeared after number and type of different phonetic features was taken into account.
20652455:101	Our results only partly confirm Tallal’s theory (e.g., Tallal, ) that problems with fast transitions are at the basis of speech perception deficits in natural speech.
20652455:102	The current findings indicated that, for all children, fast transitions were only perceived less accurately when they also differed on one phonetic feature and were therefore highly similar.
20652455:103	Contrasts that differed on more phonetic features were easier to discriminate even when stops were involved.
20652455:104	There were no differences in speed of perception.
20652455:105	As far as accuracy is concerned, it seems that only the combination of similarity and fast transitions was difficult to perceive.
20652455:106	On the other hand and more important, we did not replicate Tallal’s finding that fast transitions were especially problematic for RD children.
20652455:107	Rather, RD children and CA controls did not differ in accuracy and even though accuracy levels were in general high, results showed that highly similar stop consonants were relatively more difficult to distinguish for all readers.
20652455:108	To test perception skills more purely, ruling out word knowledge, we used pseudowords in a task similar to the VCV discrimination task (e.g., ) used by Adlard and Hazan.
20652455:109	Their study showed that natural stop consonant contrasts were more problematic for RD children.
20652455:110	Adlard and Hazan already remarked that there were also sizable error rates for the RD group on minimal pairs like “smack” and “snack”.
20652455:111	Errors occurred in the case of fricatives, nasals, and approximants, yet these failed to reach significance.
20652455:112	Closer inspection of their data suggests, however, that the difference on stop consonants was significant only because controls had a low error percentage on stop consonant contrasts.
20652455:113	Apparently, accurate perception of stop consonants was not more problematic for RD children than perception of other sounds; only relative to the controls these errors were more pronounced.
20652455:114	Our data involved pseudowords and were therefore less familiar to the control group, possibly explaining the different findings.
20652455:115	As pointed out before, we found that stop consonants were difficult for all readers, yet only when they were similar as well.
20652455:116	As far as accuracy is concerned, our study showed that RD children did not differ from CA controls.
20652455:117	Although the sample size is not large, it is comparable to previous studies in the field (e.g., Adlard & Hazan, ) that found differences between groups, suggesting that these sample sizes are sufficient to identify these kinds of effects.
20652455:118	Still, we have to acknowledge that it is a possibility that a larger sample size could have enhanced power to such an extent that more differences between groups would have appeared.
20652455:119	However, in contrast to the medium to large effects that were significant with the current sample size, these effects would be rather small and consequently less meaningful.
20652455:120	Admittedly, it is also possible that our findings differ from the previous studies (e.g., Godfrey et al., ) because these have used artificial speech continua.
20652455:121	It is a possibility that, in natural speech, other acoustic cues might obviate possible problems with fast transitions.
20652455:122	However, other acoustic cues may only play a role when comparing stop and fricative contrasts, not when stop consonants have to be compared that only differ on place of articulation.
20652455:123	The current findings are also in line with previous research with Dutch children by Blomert and Mitterer, which also suggested that accuracy differences between groups disappeared when natural speech was used.
20652455:124	Serniclaes et al. also did not find differences in accuracy between RD and CA on continua endpoints.
20652455:125	They suggested that this could be due to the fairly long ISI of 100 ms that was used.
20652455:126	Mody et al. found differences between groups but reported larger differences with shorter ISIs (10 vs. 50 or 100 ms).
20652455:127	In contrast, Breznitz found differences with an ISI of 80 ms but not with a shorter ISI of 30 ms.
20652455:128	In our study, we used an ISI of 200 ms because ISIs shorter than 200 ms may lead to mutual masking whereas longer ISIs may make discrimination too easy (for discussion, see Gerrits, p. 16).
20652455:129	It is a possibility that the use of the longer 200 ms ISI may have caused the lack of accuracy differences.
20652455:130	By contrast, Adlard and Hazan used an ISI of 1 s and found differences between groups.
20652455:131	Clearly, more systematic study into the influence of different ISIs is required.
20652455:132	We carefully selected participants to specifically exclude the possibility that the speech perception problems were due to comorbid problems such as ADHD or other language problems.
20652455:133	A similar procedure was followed by Adlard and Hazan, who also excluded children who had current or earlier problems with speech production.
20652455:134	As recent definitions of RD also stress resistance to remediation and persistence of the reading problems, we have excluded children with a lack of educational opportunity expressed by low vocabulary knowledge and retested all children a year after our study took place.
20652455:135	McArthur and Bishop have stressed the importance of examining individual differences within the group of children that is reading disabled.
20652455:136	It may well be that only a subgroup of reading disabled children has problems in rapid auditory processing.
20652455:137	In the present study, we found reading disabled children slower in giving responses to identical item pairs.
20652455:138	We therefore also examined the scatter plots of the average scores of both reading disabled and control children.
20652455:139	Although there was some overlap in scores, there was no evidence that a subgroup of reading disabled children was responsible for the group differences we found, so slower identification appeared to be a general characteristic of the children with reading problems.
20652455:140	However, the possibility remains that a number of RD children have comorbid problems.
20652455:141	Further research should make clear whether also in transparent orthographies like Dutch such a comorbid subgroup may have problems in speech perception accuracy.
20652455:142	On the basis of Treiman and Struiksma, we predicted the perception of phonemes in clusters to be more difficult than in single consonants, resulting in more errors and a longer processing time.
20652455:143	The current study showed that the discrimination of clusters was not more difficult than discriminating single consonants and they did not require more processing time.
20652455:144	Apparently, a surrounding cluster did not hamper straightforward recognition that sounds were identical or different.
20652455:145	In research on spelling development, however, Treiman demonstrated that consonants in second position within an initial consonant cluster were problematic.
20652455:146	Treiman suggested that these errors were due to a lack in phoneme awareness, a failure to analyze the clusters into their component phonemes, treating the first and the second consonants as a unit.
20652455:147	In contrast, we did not find differences in correct detection proportions between position 2 in an initial consonant cluster and consonants in single position.
20652455:148	Our study suggests that children knew which component phonemes were in position 2 within the cluster.
20652455:149	In a study of German dyslexics, Landerl and Wimmer also showed that, for grade 3 dyslexic children, phoneme segmentation of onset consonant clusters was not problematic.
20652455:150	Consequently, lack of phoneme awareness appears not to be the cause of problems with consonant clusters in Dutch.
20652455:151	This is in line with Vellutino et al., who argued that phoneme awareness may be less of a problem for Dutch reading disabled children because of the shallow orthography of Dutch (but see Patel, Snowling & de Jong, for a different view).
20652455:152	In a shallow orthography, it is possible that orthographic knowledge feeds back into the phonological system, preventing phonological awareness problems.
20652455:153	However, this does not mean that there is no phonological deficit; only the manifestation of the phonological deficit may have changed (e.g., de Jong and van der Leij, ).
20652455:154	In the current study, our main focus was on processing time.
20652455:155	The CA control group was faster in identifying identical sounds than in distinguishing different sounds, yet there was no difference for the RD children.
20652455:156	Our findings demonstrate that, even when using natural speech, the method is sensitive enough to detect speech perception problems.
20652455:157	However, it could be argued that the differences in reaction time reflect differences in more basic speed of processing abilities such a pure motor response/preparation.
20652455:158	Many studies point to slower RTs for RD children on a number of tasks (e.g., see Talcott et al., ).
20652455:159	However, note that, in the current study, we did not find differences between RD and CA controls when children were required to distinguish between different sounds but we did find them on a similar task when identifying identical items.
20652455:160	If basic (motor) skills had been a decisive factor, our data would have showed differences between RD and CA controls on all measures, with RD children consistently showing slower RTs.
20652455:161	Therefore, motor skills do not seem to account for the findings on speech processing in the current study.
20652455:162	The results of this study suggest that specific problems for RD children in accuracy found in other studies (e.g., Adlard and Hazan, ) resurface in a transparent orthography through processing speed.
20652455:163	As said, the processing speed deficit occurs in identifying sounds rather than in discriminating sounds.
20652455:164	In line with this finding, Serniclaes et al. argued that RD children were actually better in discriminating sounds belonging to the same phonemic category.
20652455:165	These authors suggested that the reason for inferior speech perception was not so much a deficit in the perception of sounds but rather a result of less well-established phonemic categories, preventing them from subsuming allophones under the same phonemic category.
20652455:166	The point Serniclaes et al. made was that RD have no perception problems per se.
20652455:167	However, they argued that their phonemic categories may be less well established as they distinguish between different sounds that differ acoustically yet belong to the same phonemic category (allophones) and therefore should not be distinguished for understanding.
20652455:168	We assume that this uncertainty may result in processing problems and longer RTs for RD children.
20652455:169	It could therefore be speculated that the representation of consonants was not as well developed in the case of RD children and was possibly not distinct enough to differentiate different consonant sounds (see Elbro, ).
20652455:170	On the other hand, similar to the research by Serniclaes, our present data indicated that the RD children’s mental specification was sufficiently distinct to differentiate stop and nonstop consonants (e.g., the /p/ can be differentiated from the /t/ when hearing the pair /prar/ -/trar/).
20652455:171	Consequently, we suggest that RD children are less automatic in evaluating a phonetic representation, perhaps reflecting a general problem in access to phonology.
20652455:172	These problems do not surface when detecting differences between sounds or only when sounds involve fast transitions as predicted by Tallal’s theory.
20652455:173	Rather, poor readers experience problems with the fast identification of all sounds.
20652455:174	Our correlational analysis supported this finding as these correlations showed that reading related variation in identifying sounds was significant for the combined groups and distinguished RD and CA control readers.
20652455:175	In contrast, fast discrimination of sounds was not the crucial difference between RD and CA controls.
20652455:176	Based on data from a recent longitudinal study, de Jong and van der Leij suggested that RD children’s access to phonemes may remain relatively fragile.
20652455:177	Similarly, it has also been suggested that normal reading German children rely mainly on highly efficient sublexical recoding at the level of grapheme–phoneme correspondences (Ziegler & Goswami, ).
20652455:178	If RD children lack efficient access to phonemes, sublexical recoding may proceed very slowly with a resulting lack of fluency in reading.
20652455:179	To disentangle whether fast transitions or phonetic similarity between sounds was causing problems for RD children, we also examined contrasts that were either very similar, i.e., that differed in one phonetic feature, or less similar, i.e., that differed on three phonetic differences.
20652455:180	In addition, we compared stop consonant contrasts (with fast transitions) with fricative contrasts (without fast transitions) that both differed only in one phonetic feature and were therefore just as similar.
20652455:181	Studdert-Kennedy has argued that, rather than the occurrence of fast transitions, phonetic similarity may be the underlying reason for problems in speech perception.
20652455:182	Our results showed that, for both groups, similar speech sounds involving fast transitions were more difficult to distinguish and that this was not a specific problem for RD children, supporting Studdert-Kennedy’s theory.
20652455:183	Similarly, Adlard and Hazan showed that, with a test involving real words, the highest error rates were obtained when pairs differed in one feature only.
20652455:184	Their research also indicated that children made more errors when pairs of nonspeech sounds were similar so this seems to be a general issue in the processing of sounds.
20652455:185	Tallal assumed that fast transitions in stop consonants were problematic for RD children.
20652455:186	We found that this was indeed the case, yet only when sounds were highly similar.
20652455:187	However, in contrast to Tallal, these problems did not differentiate poor readers and controls, and therefore, they do not provide an explanation for the lack of reading speed that is so central to RD children’s problems in transparent orthographies.
20652455:188	To conclude, the major finding of the present study was that RD children were slower in identifying sounds relative to CA controls, even though there was no difference in speed of discriminating sounds, suggesting that RD and CA groups differ in identification speed.
20652455:189	It is possible that less distinct phonemic categories underlie this lack of processing speed, which in turn may lead to a lack in reading fluency.
19604366:0	Background 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a messenger molecule, synthesized from arginine by a family of three distinct nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: (a) neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS type I); (b) endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS type III) that are Ca2 + dependent; (c) macrophagical NOS (mNOS or NOS type II) that is Ca2 + independent . The neuronal isoform of this enzyme (nNOS), is regulated by several cofactors including calmodulin, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) . 
The NO system is implicated in the control of many behaviors . In particular, several studies suggest that NO might facilitate the expression of rodents' sexual behavior in both sexes, at peripheral and central levels, probably through its action on specific neurotransmitter system (for a review see ).
19604366:1	Peripherally, NO produced by eNOS and nNOS is involved in several tasks as the regulation of penile erection , ovulation  or transfer of oocytes from the ovaries to the oviducts . Centrally, NO has an important role in controlling male and female sexual behavior [ - ].
19604366:2	This has been confirmed by the use of different lines of knockout mice.
19604366:3	In particular the disruption of the exon 2 (resulting in residual nNOS activity due to the expression of alternatively spliced RNA forms) induces an improper sexual behavior , whereas the disruption of exon 6 (resulting in the total loss of nNOS activity) induces the disappearance of male sexual behavior and female ovulation .
19604366:4	Finally, NO promotes the release of gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRH) [ - ].
19604366:5	The control of reproductive behavior by NO is mediated at central level, by interactions with other neurotransmitter systems (for reviews see [ - ]).
19604366:6	For instance, testosterone (T), in male rats, increases NO levels, through its action on nNOS.
19604366:7	In the medial preoptic area (MPA), NO stimulates the release of dopamine (DA) that, in turn, promotes copulation . The action on nNOS is mediated by the aromatization of T into 17β-estradiol (E 2) and not by the reduction to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) .
19604366:8	Moreover, the NO-cGMP system is part of an intracellular signaling pathway to regulate the facilitatory effect of α 1-adrenoreceptors on lordosis behavior in female rats (for a review see ).
19604366:9	A correlation between serotonin and NO is demonstrated by the partial alteration of the serotonin metabolism in mice lacking nNOS gene  and by the action of NO as a mediator of the stimulatory effects of serotonin in the MPA on luteinizing hormone secretion . 
The presence of NO-producing neurons has been described in detail by means of histochemistry for NADPH-diaphorase, nNOS immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, in numerous areas of the vertebrate central nervous system [ - ].
19604366:10	In the rat, the distribution of nNOS positive cells has been detailed in particular in hypothalamic and limbic nuclei involved in the control of the reproductive behavior: e.g., MPA, paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), arcuate (Arc) and ventromedial nucleus (VMH), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) [ - ], medial amygdala (MeA) and bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract (BAOT) . 
Several studies in rodents show that, in these regions, nNOS expression is regulated by gonadal hormones.
19604366:11	Castration decreases and treatment with T or its metabolite E 2 increases the number of nNOS- or NADPH-diaphorase-positive cells, as well as the expression of mRNA for nNOS in MPA, PVN and ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMHvl) ([ - ]; for a complete bibliographic review see ).
19604366:12	The fundamental role of E 2 and of estrogen receptors (ERs) in regulating/differentiating the nNOS system is also confirmed by our preliminary results obtained in mutant mice that either lacked the ERα receptor or were not exposed to E 2 (aromatase knockout, ArKO) male mice.
19604366:13	In both cases we detected a significant decrease of nNOS immunoreactivity in the MPA, PVN and Arc . Moreover it has been shown that ERα and AR interact to regulate nNOS in male and female brain in a site-specific manner . NADPH-diaphorase activity enhances during the estrus phase in the BAOT  and MeA  of female rat.
19604366:14	To further clarify the interrelationships between NO and gonadal hormones, we investigated here the effects of the estrous cycle on the expression of nNOS immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic and limbic system of female mice, with a focus on nuclei involved in the control of reproduction.
19604366:15	In addition we have compared the distribution of nNOS immunoreactivity between male and female mice, in order to verify the presence of sexual dimorphism.
19604366:16	Results 
Discussion 
Present data show that during the estrous cycle the expression of nNOS may significantly vary in some limbic-hypothalamic nuclei.
19604366:17	Statistically significant changes in the nNOS-ir cells number were observed only in MPA and Arc, whereas in the other nuclei (e.g., PVN, BSTmpm, BSTmv and VMHvl) the NOS-ir cells number does not show significant changes during the different stages of the estrous cycle.
19604366:18	Moreover, changes in the number of nNOS-ir cells in MPA and Arc do not follow the same pattern.
19604366:19	In MPA, the highest number of positive neurons was detected during estrus, whereas in proestrus and diestrus we have the lower values.
19604366:20	In Arc, the highest number of nNOS-ir cells was detected in proestrus, while metestrus and diestrus show the lower number of NOS-ir cells.
19604366:21	The comparison with males shows a stable sex dimorphism (males have a higher number of nNOS-ir cells in comparison to almost all the different phases of the estrous cycle) in the VMHvl and in the BSTmv (when considering only the less intensely stained elements, e.g. probably the part of NO-producing population that is less active).
19604366:22	In MPA and Arc, sex differences were detected only comparing some phases of the cycle.
19604366:23	In both nuclei, females in estrus have a number of positive cells that is not significantly different with that of males.
19604366:24	The distribution of nNOS immunoreactive elements within the limbic-hypothalamic region confirms previous reports in both mice  and rats . Major clusters of NO-producing neurons are present within the preoptic area, the BST, the PVN and the VMH; scattered positive elements are present in the Arc nucleus.
19604366:25	All these regions show, in mice, a large number of alpha and beta estrogen receptors (ER) , progesterone receptors (PR) , and androgen receptors (AR) , therefore confirming the idea that gonadal hormones may modulate the expression of nNOS . 
Conclusion 
In summary, the data collected in this study show and confirm the presence of nitrinergic neurons in several hypothalamic nuclei involved in the control of reproductive activity of male and female mice.
19604366:26	In addition, we demonstrated that in female mice there are at least two populations of NO producing neurons, sensitive and insensitive to gonadal hormones fluctuations during the estrous cycle.
19604366:27	The mechanisms of this differential, site-specific, sensitivity are not clear, but probably are based on the different pattern of distribution of AR, ER, and PR and SERMs within the nNOS system.

Results 
Discussion 
The main findings of this study are that PS beads up to a diameter of 240 nm were taken up by the placenta and, further, were able to cross the placental barrier without affecting the viability of the explant.
20064770:1	We used fluorescently labeled negatively charged PS beads of 50, 80, 240, and 500 nm as model particles because of their known biocompatibility and easy detection.
20064770:2	This study provides evidence that the translocation of these beads across the placenta is size dependent.
20064770:3	We applied the particles at a single dose and at a high concentration, which can be assumed to be more representative of an intravenous injection, as reported for glioblastoma treatment with magnetic nanoparticles, than an environmental exposure scenario.
20064770:4	With the ex vivo perfusion model, the mechanism of nanoparticle transport through the placenta very close to the in vivo situation can be studied, but it is limited to a perfusion period of a few hours: Chronic treatments with low doses over a long period are not possible because of tissue degradation ( ; ).
20064770:5	A further limitation of the model is that the perfusion rate measured in the explant represents only the late phase of pregnancy, for which the thickness of the barrier layer between the maternal and the fetal circuit is reduced and the number of fetal capillaries is increased.
20064770:6	Thus, the perfusion rates obtained with the ex vivo perfusion model may be higher than during the greater part of pregnancy in vivo .
20064770:7	The consideration of the mass concentration of nanoparticles is often criticized, and instead surface concentration or particle number concentration are suggested as a model.
20064770:8	In the present study we intentionally selected a highly biocompatible nanomaterial to specifically examine the barrier capacity of the placenta without inducing toxic side effects.
20064770:9	Thus, in this particular case, particle surface–dependent or mass-dependent toxicities play minor roles.
20064770:10	Nevertheless, all relevant particle characteristics are summarized in for later comparison and interpretation.
20064770:11	Possible transport routes for nanoparticles across the placenta are diffusion, vesicular transport, transmembranal transporter proteins, and the transtrophoblastic channel system.
20064770:12	The perfusion profiles obtained for the 50- and 80-nm beads could be interpreted to suggest that these particles cross the placenta very quickly by simple diffusion.
20064770:13	If so, the second application of PS beads should lead to a continuous translocation of the beads, which is not the case.
20064770:14	The high doses applied could have induced dramatic clogging of the intervillous space on the maternal side, such that transfer routes were nearly blocked.
20064770:15	Vesicle transport such as clathrin- or caveolin-mediated uptake is likely for the smaller PS particles because of their restricted size of 60 nm for clathrin-coated vesicles and 120 nm for caveolin-coated vesicles but rather questionable for bigger spheres of 240 nm (for comprehensive reviews, see ; ).
20064770:16	The extent to which placenta transporter proteins in the basal- or brush-border membrane (e.g., of the syncytiotrophoblast) are involved in the nanoparticle transport remains unclear.
20064770:17	The transtrophoblastic channel system represents a continuous membrane-lined tubular structure of about 20 nm in diameter that connects the intervillous space with the stroma and may act as a pressure-dependent valve regulating fetal water balance.
20064770:18	If the arterial pressure exceeds 80 cm H 2O (corresponding to around 60 mmHg), this channel system is dilated, allowing the transport of liquid and small molecules.
20064770:19	Whether this is true for the PS beads in our perfusion experiments requires further detailed investigations.
20064770:20	The critical size for PS nanoparticles to cross a placental barrier seems to be consistent with observations made at the air–blood barrier, where fluorescent PS beads of around 200 nm diameter penetrated cells in an energy-independent way.
20064770:21	But the capability of nanomaterials to cross the placenta appears to depend not only on particle size but also on the material composition or surface coating.
20064770:22	It has been shown that polyethylene glycol–coated gold particles up to 30 nm in diameter were not able to cross the placenta with the same experimental setup as used in the present study.
20064770:23	The fact that PS beads and gold nanoparticles interact differently with biological compounds suggests that, in general, the capability for transplacental transfer mechanism(s) has to be assessed separately for each type of nanoparticle.
20064770:24	Conclusion 
Our study showed a clear size-dependent barrier capacity of a healthy human placenta for PS nanoparticles, including an analysis of the viability and functionality of the tissue after the perfusion.
20064770:25	We suggest that nanoparticles, in general, therefore have the potential for transplacental transfer.
20064770:26	This potential underscores the need for further nanotoxicologic studies on this important organ system.

15107133:0	Background 
Rho family members including Rac, Cdc42, and Rho are essential regulators of various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization, mitogenesis, activation of kinase cascades, transcriptional activation, and stimulation of DNA synthesis [ - ].
15107133:1	Interestingly, these small GTPases have been implicated in oncogenesis, through multiple approaches [ - ].
15107133:2	Like all members of the Ras superfamily, Rho proteins function as molecular switches.
15107133:3	They characteristically cycle between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state.
15107133:4	Switching between these states is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which promote the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and thereby activate the small GTPase . The Dbl family of GEFs for Rho GTPases are characterized by the presence of a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology domain (PH).
15107133:5	While the DH domain catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange, the PH domain is essential for membrane localization via phospholipid binding .
15107133:6	The prototype DH-PH domain-containing protein, the Dbl proto-oncogene, was originally isolated as a transforming gene from a diffuse B-cell lymphoma, and was later shown to release GDP from Cdc42 . Furthermore, other Dbl-like GEFs such as Vav, Tiam, Ost, and Dbs have also been demonstrated to cause cellular transformation via their activation of Rho family proteins or through the amplification of signaling cascades [ , ].
15107133:7	Therefore, the study of these regulators is likely to reveal crucial details of cellular homeostasis and its disruption in cancer.
15107133:8	To date, three Rac proteins with an overall homology of around 90% have been identified in man.
15107133:9	Amongst these, Rac2 is hematopoietic specific and involved in the oxidative burst, whereas Rac1 and Rac3 are ubiquitously expressed . To elucidate the cellular functions of Rac3 in relation to its downstream effectors, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using constitutively active Rac3 as bait.
15107133:10	Here we report the identification of a novel protein that functions as both a binding partner for activated Rac and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho.
15107133:11	Results 
Discussion 
In this study, we have characterized Scambio, a novel nucleotide exchange factor of the Dbl family.
15107133:12	Scambio contains a tandem DH-PH domain, the classical hallmark of a GEF for Rho family proteins.
15107133:13	Within the Dbl family, some members act exclusively on specific small GTPases, whereas others are more promiscuous . Our data indicate that Scambio functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA and RhoC, but does not activate Rac or Cdc42.
15107133:14	Thus, Scambio belongs to the class of Rho-GEFs with specificity for a subset of Rho-related small GTPases.
15107133:15	RT-PCR analysis indicated that Scambio is ubiquitously expressed.
15107133:16	However, this non-quantitative assay did not allow us to determine relative expression levels.
15107133:17	Therefore, we raised antisera and performed Western blot analysis of multiple mouse tissue lysates.
15107133:18	This revealed that the Scambio protein is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, and, to a lesser extent, in the lungs.
15107133:19	This finding suggests that it has an important function in these tissues.
15107133:20	Interestingly, substantial evidence indicates that RhoA is crucial to heart development and physiology [ - ].
15107133:21	RhoA has been shown to be highly up-regulated during early heart development, is important for normal embryogenesis , and has been implicated in the regulation of hypertrophic cardiac muscle cell growth . RhoA also controls serum response factor (SRF) dependent cardiac specific gene expression via interactions with the β1-integrin signaling pathway and changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Furthermore, at least one RhoGEF specific to cardiac cells has already been identified.
15107133:22	The p63Rho GEF, a RhoA specific, Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor, for example, has been shown to induce stress fiber formation in fibroblasts and cardiac myoblasts .
15107133:23	However, further experimentation will be necessary to determine if Scambio is also involved in cardiac development and contractility.
15107133:24	Scambio is unlike the majority of Dbl family members in that it can bind to activated GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42.
15107133:25	Interestingly, the closely related GEF, Ost, which activates both RhoA and Cdc42, also binds to activated Rac1.
15107133:26	The downstream effects of this binding are not known, but it was suggested that Ost functions as a Rac effector and links pathways involving Rac, Cdc42 and RhoA . GEF-H1 is a second GEF capable of binding to the GTP-bound form of small Rho family GTPases.
15107133:27	Unlike Scambio, it binds both activated Rac and Rho, and is additionally able to activate them.
15107133:28	It is thought that this GEF may function to transport and activate Rac at microtubules . The Lfc protein which binds to Rac in a nucleotide-independent manner but does not activate it, has also been suggested to function to recruit Rac to microtubuli . 
We have not found evidence that Scambio colocalizes with microtubuli (LH, unpublished observations).
15107133:29	However, Scambio does contain a PH domain.
15107133:30	These domains can function as regulated membrane-binding modules that bind to inositol lipids and respond to upstream signals by targeting the host proteins to their proper cellular location . Therefore, the finding that activated Rac and Scambio precisely colocalize at the cell periphery in ruffles of cells that are adhering to fibronectin suggests that Scambio recruits activated Rac to a specific subcellular location.
15107133:31	The activity of many Dbl family GEFs is regulated.
15107133:32	For example, Vav is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation . We investigated the possible activation of Scambio by overexpressing it with a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, Bcr/Abl , but did not detect increased GEF activity (data not shown).
15107133:33	Hyperosmotic stress has been reported to activate Rho in a kidney tubular epithelial cell line . In concordance with these results, we could detect Rho activation in CHO-K1 cells upon hypertonic treatment, but this did not increase the Scambio-mediated Rho activation.
15107133:34	Cold stress also failed to increase Rho activation through Scambio (data not shown).
15107133:35	We found that Scambio had detectable GEF activity when expressed in serum-starved cells without any stimulation by external factors.
15107133:36	Interestingly, stimulation of cells that had been serum-starved, using fetal calf serum, caused a very rapid and transient increase in the exchange factor activity of Scambio, indicating that it is regulated by a component of serum such as growth factors or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).
15107133:37	Since Scambio has been demonstrated to activate both RhoA and RhoC and because many cancers are characterized by deregulation of mitogenic signals via such small GTPases, it is possible that this exchange factor plays a role in certain malignancies.
15107133:38	It will therefore be of interest to examine if any mutations can constitutively activate the GEF activity of Scambio towards Rho.
15107133:39	Conclusions 
Scambio is encoded by a novel gene that is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.
15107133:40	It binds to Rac and Cdc42 in a GTP dependent manner, but does not activate them.
15107133:41	Scambio functions to promote the activation of RhoA and RhoC, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
15107133:42	Further studies will be important in elucidating the mechanism by which Scambio integrates these dual functions and in understanding how Scambio might link pathways that signal through Rac, Cdc42, and Rho.

20609242:0	Background 
A general biological principle states that cellular function results from the combined interactions of sub-cellular structures in space and time.
20609242:1	Interactions typically manifest themselves through statistical dependencies in the spatial distributions of the involved structures.
20609242:2	Here, we adopt this general definition and we understand interaction as the collection of all effects that cause significant (above the level predicted by a null hypothesis) correlations in the positions of the participating objects.
20609242:3	Over the last decades, advances in fluorescent markers have enabled probing interactions of sub-cellular structures in the microscope, either directly or indirectly.
20609242:4	The direct approach relies on experiments that generate a signal upon the proximity required for molecular interaction.
20609242:5	Indirect approaches are based on independently imaging two populations of interest, and searching for clues of interaction in their spatial distributions.
20609242:6	This approach is based on the paradigm that spatial proximity (or co-localization ) is a hallmark of many types of physical and chemical interactions between sub-cellular structures.
20609242:7	If two or more structures interact, their spatial distributions hence appear correlated.
20609242:8	The reverse, however, is not necessarily true.
20609242:9	Presence or absence of significant co-localization does not imply presence or absence of interaction.
20609242:10	The reason is that co-localization depends on the specific interaction mechanism: An unobserved third structure may act as a confounding factor (in the statistical sense), making the observed structures appear co-localized even though they do not interact.
20609242:11	Furthermore, one can imagine interaction mechanisms that lead to spatial distributions with correlations that are not captured by simple co-localization measures.
20609242:12	Hence, the interaction has to be statistically inferred from the data.
20609242:13	Such inference, however, entails a trade-off between the objectives of pattern discovery and statistical detection power.
20609242:14	According to these objectives, two complementary approaches to co-localization analysis can be distinguished: Intensity correlation methods capitalize on pattern discovery , whereas object-based methods  emphasize detection power.
20609242:15	Intensity correlation methods quantify correlations in the intensities of different color channels on individual pixels.
20609242:16	Intensity correlation methods are straightforward to implement and use.
20609242:17	The results, however, may be difficult to interpret since interactions need to be inferred from correlations in intensity space which is sensitive to the blurring and noise inherent to microscopic imaging systems . Object-based methods quantify the spatial relationships between sets of discrete objects.
20609242:18	This requires reducing the image to a set of geometric objects using, e.g., image segmentation or fitting of structure models.
20609242:19	Object-based approaches infer interactions from correlations in physical space which allows constructing intuitive and simple co-localization measures, such as counting the number of overlapping objects . 
The intensity-based approach is limited to interactions on a spatial scale on the order of the resolution of the microscope.
20609242:20	While the object-based approach is not necessarily limited to any particular length scale (note that the localization accuracy for an isolated object is not limited by the spatial resolution of the microscope, but rather the signal-to-noise ratio [ - ]), a spatial scale is nevertheless assumed in practice.
20609242:21	Many object-based co-localization methods rely on a hard threshold for the distances between objects in order to distinguish between "co-localized" and "not co-localized" for each individual pair of objects . The choice of distance threshold greatly influences the types of interactions that can be reliably detected.
20609242:22	The actual physical or chemical interaction between sub-cellular objects can be of short temporal duration and they can quickly separate thereafter.
20609242:23	In such situations, high thresholds can increase the detection power, but only at the expense of increased false-positive rates.
20609242:24	When interactions take place over long distances, the choice of threshold implicitly determines a range limit of the analysis.
20609242:25	Apart from fixing the interaction scale a priori using a hard distance threshold also implies a binary distinction of pair-wise distances: either they are below the threshold and hence the objects are assumed to interact - or they don't.
20609242:26	A co-localization percentage thus corresponds to an indirect measure for the preference of "interaction" over "non-interaction".
20609242:27	This preference reflects the strength of the interaction.
20609242:28	However, it also depends on the frequency of possible distances that the population of objects can assume.
20609242:29	More specifically, the cellular context in which the interactions take place is a confounding factor.
20609242:30	A high co-localization percentage can, for example, be observed in a cell with densely packed sub-cellular structures of interest, irrespective of their interaction strength.
20609242:31	This artifact needs to be considered in statistical tests  or corrected for in order to construct an interaction score . 
Taken together, object-based approaches provide intuitive co-localization measures whose statistical interpretation, however, is not straightforward.
20609242:32	Here, we establish a connection between co-localization and the notion of interaction as used in spatial statistics , namely the non-independence of the relative positions of objects under study.
20609242:33	This is based on modeling the nearest-neighbor distance distribution between the observed objects.
20609242:34	These distances are the result of interactions, measurement inaccuracies, and the geometry of the domain in which the objects are distributed.
20609242:35	This modeling provides generic procedures for inferring interaction strengths and quantifying their statistical significance.
20609242:36	Our approach helps formalizing design decisions in co-localization and interaction studies and shows how they translate to biological hypotheses.
20609242:37	Standard object-based co-localization analysis is included as a special case, which makes explicit the connections between interaction and co-localization.
20609242:38	After developing and characterizing the statistical interaction analysis framework, we exemplify its utility in a biological study of virus entry.
20609242:39	Results and Discussion 
Conclusions 
We have introduced a statistical inference framework for robustly estimating interaction parameters from experimentally observed object distributions.
20609242:40	This allowed establishing a connection between spatial co-distributions of objects and interaction, by formulating the object-based interaction analysis problem in a spatial statistics framework based on nearest-neighbor distance distributions.
20609242:41	The present framework provides generic procedures for inferring interaction strengths and quantifying their statistical significance.
20609242:42	Standard object-based co-localization analysis is included as a limit case, making explicit the connections between the present framework and more classical approaches.
20609242:43	In the present framework, two novel key quantities emerge: (i) the state density q ( d ), which is the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances expected under the null hypothesis of no interaction, and (ii) the interaction potential ϕ ( d ), which defines the strength and distance dependence of the interaction.
20609242:44	We have shown that classical co-localization analysis amounts to estimating the parameters of a step potential.
20609242:45	This requires a notion of "inside" and "outside", either naturally defined by the physical extent of the objects or imposed through the step function's distance threshold.
20609242:46	For point-like objects, or weak correlations between object positions, the choice of distance threshold is arbitrary.
20609242:47	This limitation can be relaxed by affording more general shapes of the interaction potential, which naturally extends co-localization analysis to (spatial) co-distribution analysis without requiring any additional assumptions.
20609242:48	The additional flexibility allows capturing information about a wider range of sub-cellular interactions.
20609242:49	This was demonstrated by statistical power analysis of the classical and generalized measures.
20609242:50	Our results highlight that the probability of detecting an interaction strongly depends on the cellular context.
20609242:51	We furthermore illustrated the influence of the range of an interaction on its detectability.
20609242:52	Test statistics that include knowledge about the shape of the true interaction potential can greatly reduce the number of samples required to achieve a certain target power.
20609242:53	Physico-chemical models might provide such prior knowledge.
20609242:54	Alternatively, a non-parametric phenomenological potential can be estimated from the data as demonstrated here.
20609242:55	This potential can then serve as a template for the parametric potentials used in subsequent analyses.
20609242:56	In addition, the present framework enables comparison of the likelihoods of different hypothetical physico-chemical interaction models directly on the original image data.
20609242:57	The present approach enables applying a wide range of established statistical tools for analyzing experimental data, from parameter identification to model selection.
20609242:58	This workflow was illustrated by studying the spatial patterns of endosomes and viruses infecting live human cells.
20609242:59	In this case study, the experimental data were very well explained using only a single free parameter per cell.
20609242:60	Among the five potentials considered, the step potential (corresponding to the classical co-localization measure) was worst in explaining the data.
20609242:61	This highlights the benefit of the present method over classical co-localization analysis.
20609242:62	Moreover, the fitted potentials provided additional quantitative readouts that could be used in subsequent machine learning analyses.
20609242:63	For simplicity the case study was done on 2D projections of 3D images.
20609242:64	The presented approach, however, is equally applicable in three dimensions without any changes, provided three-dimensional object detection and segmentation is available.
20609242:65	Projecting the data into two dimensions alters the estimated potentials (as it also does for any other co-localization measure), since it distorts both the distance data D and the state density q ( d ).
20609242:66	We empirically found that the strengths of the potentials estimated from the projected 2D data may be smaller than those estimated directly on the raw 3D data (data not shown).
20609242:67	Although all distances D are systematically reduced by the projection, this effect is overcompensated by the non-linear distortion of q ( d ), which is strongest for intermediate distances, but negligible for very small and large distances.
20609242:68	Besides projection artifacts, errors in the image processing may also influence the estimated co-localization measures.
20609242:69	Depending on the accuracy of the image segmentation method used, object sizes can be under- or overestimated, or entire objects can be missed altogether.
20609242:70	This problem is inherent to all forms of co-localization or distribution analysis.
20609242:71	We have assessed the sensitivity of our method with respect to image segmentation errors by successively eroding or dilating the endosomes from the presented case study.
20609242:72	The results show that the mean of the estimated strength of the Hermquist potential remains unaffected, yet the variance of the estimate increases for strong erosion when entire endosomes start to be missed (data not shown).
20609242:73	This robustness of the present method is due to the state density q ( d ) correcting for size errors.
20609242:74	The classical co-localization measure, naively corrected for the cellular context by subtracting the amount of unspecific co-localization C 0, significantly changes when under- or over-estimating object sizes.
20609242:75	For strong erosion, leading to very small and frequently missing objects, it even drops to a meaningless value of zero (data not shown).
20609242:76	Since image segmentation errors are always present in practical applications, we consider the robustness of our method one of its major advantages over classical measures.
20609242:77	The presented framework is limited by the same assumptions that also underlie classical co-localization analysis: (i) spatial homogeneity and (ii) isotropy of the interaction within the observation window, and (iii) exclusively nearest-neighbor interactions between objects of different classes.
20609242:78	Assumption (i) is, e.g., violated if large areas of the analyzed images do not contain any objects.
20609242:79	In this case, estimation of q ( d ) is not robust.
20609242:80	Assumption (iii) imposes limits on admissible distances between objects: If objects X are attracted toward objects Y the distances between the objects within the set Y need to be larger than the typical interaction range.
20609242:81	All of these limitations could be relaxed by using position-dependent interaction potentials or allowing for many-body interactions as described by general Gibbs processes.
20609242:82	Considering such processes, however, is theoretically and numerically challenging.
20609242:83	The presented framework could also be extended by including additional confounding factors, such as imaging artifacts causing spurious co-localization.
20609242:84	Temporal plasticity of interactions, cell-to-cell variations, and experiment-to-experiment variations could be accounted for through additional co-variates (time, cell index, experiment index) in the statistical model.
20609242:85	Already in its present form, the statistical framework can be used to test more general hypotheses, such as "interactions are stronger in strain A than in strain B". 
The interpretation of fitted potentials is limited to their relative strengths.
20609242:86	In the absence of a mechanistic or physical model of the process that has created the observed spatial pattern, biophysical interpretation of the identified parameter values is difficult or misleading.
20609242:87	This is because the fitted interaction potentials reflect the collection of all intracellular phenomena that lead to the observed point pattern.
20609242:88	Interestingly, however, a relation between the steady-state distribution of a diffusion process with added deterministic forces and the distribution of the Gibbs process (Eq.
20609242:89	4) exists: If the deterministic force acting between the diffusing objects is given by -∂ ϕ /∂ d the two distributions become identical (in appropriate units).
20609242:90	This fact points a possibility of connecting fitted interaction potentials with biophysical processes.

16762046:0	Introduction 
Hereditary breast cancer accounts for around 5–10% of all breast cancer cases, while the other 90–95% is assumed to be 'sporadic', with no apparent family history.
16762046:1	A large proportion of familial breast cancer (<40%) can be attributed to mutations in the high-risk genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Additional breast cancer genes have been discovered, largely through disease syndromes displaying a predisposition for breast cancer.
16762046:2	Breast cancer in families with syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (resulting from p53 gene mutations)  and Cowden syndrome (the mutated PTEN gene) , however, are each estimated to account for less than 1% of hereditary breast cancer, and mutations in ATM (the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia) and CHEK2 are also predicted to account for only a small proportion of familial breast cancer . The genetic basis of the large majority of familial breast cancer therefore remains unaccounted for.
16762046:3	It is well known that deficiencies in DNA repair can lead to carcinogenesis.
16762046:4	Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) may be the most detrimental form of DNA damage because, if left unrepaired, the detection of broken chromosomes will lead to cell death.
16762046:5	Additionally, if DSBs are repaired improperly, they can result in chromosomal translocations and cancer . Central to the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination is RAD51, a homologue of the Escherichia coli DNA repair protein, RecA.
16762046:6	RAD51 functions in DNA repair by mediating homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions , and its importance is further supported by the presence of many highly conserved orthologues . 
RAD51 interacts (directly or indirectly) with a large number of proteins involved in DNA repair and the cell cycle, among others, as reviewed by Richardson . Interestingly, four of these proteins – BRCA1, BRCA2, p53 and ATM – have been shown to be breast cancer predisposition genes in high-risk families.
16762046:7	Additionally, RAD51 -/- mice are embryonic lethal, similar to BRCA1 -/- mice . Alteration in either the expression or protein structure of RAD51 could therefore have similar deleterious effects on these essential pathways, leading to breast cancer.
16762046:8	Besides the interactions of RAD51 with key players in breast tumourigenesis, there is additional evidence to support a role for RAD51 in breast cancer.
16762046:9	The RAD51 gene is located at chromosome position 15q15.1 , a region shown to exhibit loss of heterozygosity in a large range of cancers, including those of the lung, the colorectum and the breast . Specifically, 70% of breast tumours (from subjects with an unknown family history)  and 32% of sporadic (nonfamilial) breast cancers have been found to exhibit loss of heterozygosity of this region . RAD51 expression has also been found altered in both primary tumours and cancer cell lines.
16762046:10	RAD51 mRNA expression in 16/16 of tumours from BRCA1/2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer patients was found to be one-half of that of the BT-474 breast cancer cell line , and protein levels were found to be decreased in 30% of breast tumours from a combination of sporadic and high-risk breast cancer patients . 
In contrast, there are reports of increased RAD51 expression in tumours and cancer cell lines.
16762046:11	Ma and colleagues  detected an increase in RAD51 mRNA expression in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ -Invasive Ductal Carcinoma transition and high-tumour-grade breast cancers, while it has also been found that overexpression of RAD51 correlates with histological grading of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma . There are numerous reports of RAD51 overexpression in a large range of cancer cell lines, including cervical cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer . 
These RAD51 expression data are difficult to reconcile with a suppressor function, as suggested by the loss of heterozygosity data and knockout mouse data.
16762046:12	Instead, the data suggest that any dysregulation of RAD51 may be associated with downstream biological and clinical effects.
16762046:13	Indeed, it has been demonstrated that homologous pairing and strand transfer, essential events in the repair of DSBs, require stoichiometric amounts of RAD51 such that overexpression or underexpression of RAD51 results in a lack of formation of structures fundamental in the DSB repair process . 
Despite the presented evidence for a role for deregulated expression of RAD51 in DSB repair defects and/or breast cancer, there have been few studies assessing the effects of RAD51 gene variation on breast cancer risk.
16762046:14	These have largely focused on assessing the risk associated with a polymorphic variation in RAD51 .
16762046:15	Although there is some evidence that the rare -135G>C variant in RAD51 is involved in modifying the BRCA1/2 -mutation-positive breast cancer phenotype, studies focusing on the association between the RAD51 -135G>C and -172G>T variants and breast cancer risk using case-control analysis have shown little support for a significant association with breast cancer . 
With regard to RAD51 mutations and cancer predisposition, three studies have used various mutation detection methodologies to screen RAD51 in breast cancer patients.
16762046:16	An analysis of 93 early-onset breast cancer cases, 9% of which had a strong family history, revealed no coding region variation . A second study in 2000 assessed a Japanese population of 45 well-characterised high-risk breast cancer patients using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and detected one relatively rare variant, an arginine for glutamine substitution at amino acid 150 (c.449G>A) . No other sequence alterations were detected in the Japanese study.
16762046:17	Rapakko and colleagues  recently used conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis to investigate 74 high-risk and 52 moderate-risk breast and/or ovarian cancer families of Finnish descent.
16762046:18	All of the variation detected was noncoding and a majority was found in both cases and controls.
16762046:19	It has been reported, however, that the sequence variation detection sensitivity of conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and SSCP is around 75% and 60–85%, respectively , and it is possible that some variation was not detected.
16762046:20	We therefore sought to determine whether there is a role for variation in the entire RAD51 coding region (and surrounding intronic regions) in index cases from a well-characterised set of 49 BRCA1/2 mutation-negative breast cancer families, using the highly sensitive technique denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).
16762046:21	These families included a subset of families where cancer-affected individuals were shown to share a haplotype around the RAD51 locus.
16762046:22	We also screened index cases from 71 families specifically for the previously reported RAD51 p.Arg150Gln variant . 
Methods 
Results 
The c.449G>A (p.Arg150Gln) variant was not detected in any of the 71 families genotyped directly for this variant, nor was it detected by DHPLC screening across this region in an additional 41 families.
16762046:23	DHPLC analysis of 51 index breast cancer cases from 46 families with a strong family history revealed 13 different sequence variations, all of which were located in noncoding regions (Table ).
16762046:24	The intron 7 and intron 8 variants have not been previously described.
16762046:25	The intron 7 c.644+57G>T
16762046:26	variant was not found in control subjects.
16762046:27	This variant is not thought to be pathogenic, however, because, although the G nucleotide is conserved in the chimpanzee, the mouse and the rat , the variant is deeply intronic and is not predicted to alter splicing using the SpliceSiteFinder prediction program . The intron 8 (c.775-41G>C) variant was not tested for in controls, but it is also unlikely to be functional due to its deep intronic location and the lack of predicted splicing effects.
16762046:28	All of the remaining five variants occurred at greater frequency in controls than cases.
16762046:29	The intron 2 (c.97+110A>G) and intron 4 (c.344-36T>G) variants appeared to occur on the same haplotype in all cases and controls.
16762046:30	Variants detected in the 5' untranslated region and the 3' untranslated region were common SNPs that have been reported previously, and were found in this population at the expected frequencies.
16762046:31	To assess the possibility that allelic imbalance of RAD51 expression may occur in breast cancer patients, we chose a common exonic SNP – exon 10 c.1020*+718G>A – as a marker of RAD51 gene expression, and we assessed four LCLs from individuals heterozygous for these variants using single nucleotide primer extension.
16762046:32	The experiment was performed in both forward and reverse directions and was conducted twice, allowing verification of results.
16762046:33	In all LCLs tested there was no evidence of one allele being favourably expressed over the other allele (data not shown).
16762046:34	Discussion 
RAD51 plays a central and critical role in the DNA repair process and also interacts with a number of proteins involved in important pathways, such as cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage signalling.
16762046:35	Four studies have investigated the coding region of RAD51 for variation in breast cancer to date.
16762046:36	Bell and colleagues  screened 93 early-onset (<40 years) breast cancer cases, 9% of which had a strong family history, for mutations in RAD51 . A yeast-based protein truncation assay revealed no truncating mutations, and sequencing of a subset of 27 individuals with age at onset <30 years revealed no coding region variation.
16762046:37	In the same study, a protein truncation assay of 15 breast cancer cell lines also revealed no truncating mutations.
16762046:38	Schmutte and colleagues  screened the RAD51 coding region and the surrounding intron/exon boundaries in 41 breast carcinomas (family history unknown) by SSCP but found no mutations.
16762046:39	There has been one report of a missense variant in RAD51 being detected in a breast cancer population to date.
16762046:40	In a Japanese population of 20 breast cancer cases with a strong family history and 25 individuals with other high-risk factors such as bilateral breast cancer, and so on, a G>A nucleotide substitution was detected by SSCP in two individuals with bilateral breast cancer, which results in an arginine residue being substituted for a glutamine residue at amino acid position 150 of RAD51 . This was an interesting finding as glutamine and arginine possess quite different physical properties that could be predicted to affect the RAD51 protein.
16762046:41	No other coding region variation was detected, but the sensitivity of SSCP to detect variation is reported as only 60–85% . 
In the present study we failed to detect the RAD51 c.449G>A (p.R150Q) variant in a large, well-characterised Australian familial breast cancer sample set.
16762046:42	Our study assessed 112 high-risk breast cancer families for this variant, with our inclusion criteria (see Methods, first inclusion criterion) being similar to those of Kato and colleagues  aside from the fact that the BRCA1/2 mutation status was not reported in the Japanese study.
16762046:43	The p.R150Q variant has not been reported in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SNP database  but it appears that it may be a relatively rare population-specific variant, and is probably not relevant to breast cancer in the Australian population.
16762046:44	Rappako and colleagues  recently used conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis to screen 74 high-risk and 52 moderate-risk Finnish breast and/or ovarian cancer families for variation in the RAD51 gene.
16762046:45	The inclusion criteria for a 'high-risk' family was similar to the current study, but we specifically investigated breast cancer patients and several families that shared a haplotype in the RAD51 region.
16762046:46	In addition, DHPLC has been reported to be a more sensitive technique for detecting sequence variation . Similar to the current study, no coding region variation was detected.
16762046:47	We did not detect any coding region variation in the RAD51 gene using the highly sensitive mutation detection technique DHPLC.
16762046:48	A number of intronic variants were found.
16762046:49	All variants, however, were either present at a similar frequency in controls and/or were located deep in the intron, and were therefore predicted not to have any functional effects.
16762046:50	Additionally, single nucleotide primer extension analysis did not reveal any change in expression of RAD51 in LCLs from breast cancer patients, indicating that there is little, if any, allelic effect on RAD51 expression due to known or undetected genetic variation.
16762046:51	Conclusion 
The aim of the present study was to attempt to elucidate a role for RAD51 as a high-risk breast cancer predisposition gene using DHPLC and well-characterised non- BRCA1/2 familial breast cancer patients.
16762046:52	We did not detect any variation in the coding region of RAD51 which may further imply the importance of maintaining the structural integrity of such a vital component of the DNA repair pathway.
16762046:53	Although other noncoding variation in the RAD51 gene may be involved in BRCA1/2 -mutation-negative breast cancers, the absence of coding or untranslated region mutations in this set of well-characterised familial cases implies that RAD51 is not a major familial breast cancer predisposition gene.

14720396:0	Patients and Methods 
Results 
Characteristics of both urban and rural populations are shown in .
14720396:1	Results of serologic testing for 76 (69%) and 38 (44%) persons from urban and rural populations, respectively, were positive for T. cruzi infection.
14720396:2	Globally, 80 (41%) persons did not fulfill criteria of serologic diagnosis of Chagas disease (in all cases, IFA test was negative).
14720396:3	In eight of nine rural seronegative patients, anti-cruzipain antibodies were investigated with negative results.
14720396:4	T. cruzi was detected by PCR amplification of a nuclear DNA fragment by using the O1/O2 primers (see Materials and Methods).
14720396:5	This reaction has been previously demonstrated to be highly specific to detect T. cruzi in blood samples.
14720396:6	Parasitemia by PCR assay was detected in 34 (17%) of 194 persons and was more frequently found in rural than in urban populations (20 and 14 positive persons, respectively; p = 0.05).
14720396:7	When only the seronegative population was considered, PCR was positive in 12 (15%) persons (3 and 9 from urban and rural population, respectively; p = 0.36).
14720396:8	Clinical characteristics of these patients are shown in . Only one patient (from the urban group) had a previous positive Machado Guerreiro test.
14720396:9	Two of three urban patients were born in a highly disease-endemic area.
14720396:10	Disease in all of these urban patients was controlled a year after recruitment, and subsequent serologic testing was negative.
14720396:11	Of the rural case-patients (born and living in La Posta), none reported previous positive serologic findings.
14720396:12	EKG and echocardiogram were performed for four patients from a rural area.
14720396:13	Discussion 
When T. cruzi infects a mammal, several immunologic reactions occur that eliminate the parasite.
14720396:14	First, a cellular immune response attempts to isolate the microorganism and avoid its wide spread.
14720396:15	Simultaneously, a humoral response occurs, with IgM antibodies first and IgG antibodies 2–3 weeks later.
14720396:16	However, because of the lack of efficacy of these mechanisms, the parasite persists in low-density tissues and in turn, triggers an inflammatory response, resulting in tissue damage during the chronic period of the disease.
14720396:17	Parasites are rarely isolated from blood or tissue from chronically infected patients, and the diagnosis is based on serologic analysis.
14720396:18	In our study, we observed that persons with positive T. cruzi in blood and negative serologic findings could be detected in a population with high epidemiologic risk.
14720396:19	This observation has been previously reported in Wincker et al., who studied PCR technique using serum samples from 45 Bolivian children.
14720396:20	They found two positive PCR results in 17 seronegative children, and in one of them, parasites were seen on direct blood examination.
14720396:21	These authors also reported a patient with the same infectious condition in 268 children with high epidemiologic risk for Chagas disease.
14720396:22	In Brazil, Avila et al. observed three discordant cases, one of which had typical findings of myocardial damage.
14720396:23	Similarly, Castro et al. detected 3 persons with positive PCR results among 9 seronegative controls, and Gomez et al., reported 10 positive PCR results in seronegative patients of 110 residents of a highly disease-endemic region.
14720396:24	Several arguments have been proposed to explain this controversial situation.
14720396:25	Recent infection that has not yet been recognized by the immune system of persons highly exposed to vectorial infections is one possible explanation.
14720396:26	However, acute infection is not a frequent event in our study population because of age and because urban population is infrequently exposed to vectorial reinfection.
14720396:27	Alternatively, one could speculate that positive samples could have been contaminated with DNA, but this theory has been disregarded by many authors.
14720396:28	We repeated serologic and PCR assays three times for each patient with two different operators, and we obtained the same results.
14720396:29	Finally, T. cruzi may chronically infect some patients but a humoral response may not develop or be detected by conventional serologic testing.
14720396:30	Addressing this point, Castro et al. observed that 80% of seronegative but positive PCR patients had lytic antibodies against T. cruzi by a complement-mediated lysis test (CoML).
14720396:31	Similarly, Leguizamón et al. have reported patients who were seropositive for Chagas disease only by inhibition transamidase assay but negative with conventional serologic testing.
14720396:32	To test this hypothesis, we searched for anti-cruzipain antibodies in eight rural patients, but all of them were negative.
14720396:33	Otherwise, independently of its cause, considering the clinical and diagnostic consequences of this phenomenon is necessary.
14720396:34	In our study, at least 3 of the 12 patients with high epidemiologic risk for Chagas disease had signs of cardiac compromise.
14720396:35	The consensus is that the detection of DNA constitutes real proof of parasites.
14720396:36	DNA detected in blood is originated from extracellular parasites recently liberated or destroyed.
14720396:37	According to this theory, Tarleton and Zhang observed that after injection of high doses of kinetoplastic DNA (kDNA) of T. cruzi in muscle, kDNA is detected in blood 2 days later.
14720396:38	However, since the parasite is infective as tripomastigotes but not as a portion of DNA, we cannot be sure that DNA detected by PCR in blood is a reliable surrogate of infecting T. cruzi forms.
14720396:39	One alternative is the possibility that fragments of amastigotes (the tissue-infecting forms) reach the bloodstream after interacting with the immune system.
14720396:40	Even though this consideration may be found relevant in the design of transfusion policies, no reliable information currently exists, and the potential for these persons to transmit the disease is still uncertain.
14720396:41	Comparing our results with a population without any risk for Chagas disease to determine the predictive value of PCR among seronegative persons would be interesting.
14720396:42	However, the accuracy of PCR has been studied in depth ( – , ).
14720396:43	While previous reports of PCR in Chagas disease used a sequence of kDNA of T. cruzi to detect the parasite, we used nuclear DNA that has been also validated.
14720396:44	Currently, we have not carried out a systematic comparison of the PCR sensitivity for different T. cruzi sequences.
14720396:45	We considered determining which of the different PCR systems cited in the literature is the more sensitive and accurate for detection of parasitemia in blood specimens of patients with chronic Chagas disease.
14720396:46	In summary, we found a prevalence of 15% of T. cruzi DNA for American trypanosomiasis in a seronegative population living in Chagas-endemic regions.
14720396:47	We also observed that some of these persons had cardiac abnormalities suggestive of Chagas cardiomyopathy.
14720396:48	Experts should consider these finding when making diagnostic, therapeutic, and transfusion recommendations.

11479343:0	INTRODUCTION 
The Caenorhabditis elegans gene exp-2 encodes a voltage-sensitive potassium (K +) channel with an amino acid sequence related to Kv-type channels from Drosophila ( Shaker Shab, Shaw, and Shal) and vertebrates (Kv1–Kv9).
11479343:1	Although the EXP-2 K + channel is structurally related to delayed-rectifier K + channels, it functions as an inward-rectifier with properties similar to the human ether-à-go-go –related gene (HERG) channel.
11479343:2	Unlike most Kv channels, which activate quite rapidly on membrane depolarization and remain open for prolonged periods at depolarized potentials, EXP-2 channels activate slowly (τ act ∼ 54 ms at 20 mV) with a midpoint of activation at about −17 mV.
11479343:3	In contrast to Kv channels, slow activation is followed by ultrafast inactivation (τ inact < 1 ms at >0 mV) leading to transient, small outward K + currents at positive potentials.
11479343:4	Hence, although EXP-2 is clearly homologous to Kv-type delayed rectifier K + channels, it acts as an inward-rectifier with functional properties very similar to the structurally-unrelated HERG channel.
11479343:5	In C. elegans several homozygous loss-of-function mutations in exp-2 display dramatic broadening of the action potential (AP) in pharyngeal muscle cells and a concomitant slowing of the pumping of the pharynx.
11479343:6	A gain-of-function mutation leads to brief pharyngeal APs in heterozygous worms and is lethal in homozygous worms.
11479343:7	The mutant phenotype is caused by a cysteine-to-tyrosine change (C480Y) in S6 of EXP-2 ( ; ).
11479343:8	Homomeric C480Y mutant channels are open at potentials as negative as −160 mV, explaining the lethal nature of the homozygous mutation.
11479343:9	In contrast to wild-type EXP-2 channels, heterotetrameric channels consisting of wild-type and mutant EXP-2 subunits begin to activate at about −70 mV (∼30 mV more negative than wild type).
11479343:10	This may account for the narrow AP in heterozygous pharyngeal muscle.
11479343:11	To understand the molecular mechanism that may be responsible in keeping mutant EXP-2 channels from closing at negative membrane potentials, we used the crystal structure of the KcsA K + channel as a scaffold to generate a 3-D model of the EXP-2 pore, including the transmembrane segments S5 and S6.
11479343:12	In this model, the large tyrosine side chain at position 480 in the C480Y mutant protrudes from S6 and projects toward S5 (see B).
11479343:13	In contrast, the much smaller cysteine side chain in the wild-type is buried close to S6 and is not in contact with S5.
11479343:14	It was very interesting in this context that had suggested that S6 may rotate counterclockwise (viewed from the outside) on KcsA channel opening.
11479343:15	If the EXP-2 channel underwent a similar conformational change, then, in analogy to KcsA, the clockwise rotation of S6 that would be required for channel closing might be impaired due to steric hindrance in the presence of a bulky residue like tyrosine.
11479343:16	Under this condition, the rotation of S6 required for long-lasting closings of the channel might not occur, not even at potentials as negative as −160 mV.
11479343:17	Here, we tested the hypothesis that S5 and S6 directly interact with each other during open-closed state transitions, and that only small side chains at position 480 in S6 allow EXP-2 K + channels to close.
11479343:18	We find that EXP-2 channels with small side chains at position 480 in S6 (Gly, Ser, and Cys) behave like wild-type EXP-2.
11479343:19	In contrast, bulky side chain substitutions (Tyr, Phe, and Trp) result in EXP-2 channels that allow large K + currents at negative potentials at which wild-type EXP-2 channels are closed.
11479343:20	Side chains of intermediate size (Thr, Val, Leu, Ile, and His) define a third channel class with properties between wild-type channels and those permanently “trapped” in an open state.
11479343:21	These findings suggest that S5 and S6 interact with each other during channel gating, and that bulky side chains at positions 421 in S5 or 480 in S6 generate steric hindrance and may prevent the postulated rotation of S6 required for stable channel closing.
11479343:22	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
EXP-2 is a voltage-gated, Kv-type K + channel that is involved in the repolarization phase of the AP in the pharyngeal muscle of C. elegans.
11479343:23	Although the EXP-2 K + channel is structurally related to delayed rectifier K + channels (∼40% amino acid sequence identity to all Kv-type channels), it is functionally distinct.
11479343:24	In response to depolarization, EXP-2 channels activate slowly and inactivate very rapidly (τ inact < 1 ms at 20 mV).
11479343:25	Upon repolarization, recovery from inactivation is also fast and strongly voltage dependent.
11479343:26	These kinetic properties make the Kv-type EXP-2 channel an inward-rectifier that resembles functionally the structurally completely unrelated HERG channel.
11479343:27	The C480Y gain-of-function mutation leads to brief pharyngeal APs in heterozygous C. elegans, and is lethal in homozygous worms ( ; ).
11479343:28	We showed previously that homomeric C480Y mutant channels remain open at potentials as negative as −160 mV, explaining the lethal nature of this mutation.
18504314:0	INTRODUCTION 
Voltage-dependent K + (Kv) channels are formed by the assembly of four protein subunits encompassing a central aqueous pore allowing for selective K + permeation across the lipid membrane.
18504314:1	Each subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), the first four segments (S1–S4) constitute the voltage sensor domain, while the last two segments (S5–S6) from each of the four subunits form the pore domain ( ; ).
18504314:2	Upon membrane depolarization, the four voltage sensor domains undergo a conformational change promoting the opening or the closing of the ion permeation pathway, a process referred to as “voltage gating” ( ; ; ).
18504314:3	Four highly conserved positively charged arginine residues within the transmembrane segment S4 have been identified as being predominantly responsible for the gating charge controlling the voltage activation of the channel ( ; ).
18504314:4	Accessibility data show that membrane depolarization causes the S4 segment to move toward the extracellular side of the membrane.
18504314:5	However, voltage gating is obviously a very complex process involving multiple intermediate conformations of the protein.
18504314:6	At a simple level, the process may be conveniently discussed in terms of two dominant states: a closed or resting conformation in which the four voltage sensors are resting in the “down” position and ion conduction through the central pore is blocked, and an open or active conformation in which the four voltage sensors are activated in the “up” position in which the central pore is opened to allow ion conduction.
18504314:7	Even though there remains significant uncertainty about the nature of the closed state ( ; ; ), there is now a broad consensus concerning the overall three-dimensional structure of Kv channels in the open-activated state.
18504314:8	This was confirmed from the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel, which is in agreement with what had been previously deduced on the basis of a wide range of structural, functional, and biophysical experiments using the homologous Shaker K + channel in its open-activated state.
18504314:9	First, the voltage sensor domain is formed by a bundle of four anti-parallel transmembrane helices, S1–S4, packed counterclockwise with their N- and C-terminal ends exposed alternatively to the intra and extracellular solution and second, the voltage sensor makes contact with the adjacent subunit pore domain in the clockwise direction.
18504314:10	One striking feature revealed by the x-ray structure is the modular nature of the voltage sensor formed by S1–S4.
18504314:11	In part, this explains why only a small number of specific interactions of the voltage sensor with the pore domain of Kv channels have been identified experimentally before the determination of the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel ( ; ; ; ).
18504314:12	In particular, a high affinity intersubunit His–Zn 2+–His metal bridge engineered in Shaker between R362 in S4 and A419 in S5 was discovered to greatly stabilize the channel in the open-activated state, suggesting that those two residues are in close atomic proximity.
18504314:13	Paradoxically, the corresponding residues R294 and A351 in the x-ray structure of Kv1.2 are relatively distant from one another, with a Cβ–Cβ distance of 13.7 Å.
18504314:14	At first view, it seems that the backbone of S4 might need to translate by at least 5–7 Å to allow the formation of the bridge.
18504314:15	Whether such a discrepancy is indicative of structural distortions induced by the engineered metal bridge, deviations in the crystal environment, or genuine differences between Shaker and Kv1.2, is unclear.
18504314:16	In fact, relatively large lateral fluctuations are displayed by the voltage sensor and a tendency to shift toward a shorter distance between R294 and A351 has been observed in previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Kv1.2 channel in a membrane environment ( ; ).
18504314:17	This suggests that the extracellular parts of S4 and S5 might alter their relative positions without causing costly structural distortions when the channel is in its membrane environment.
18504314:18	The recent x-ray structure of a chimeric Kv1.2 channel in the presence of lipids, comprising the S3b–S4 segment from Kv2.1, provides an additional piece of evidence.
18504314:19	The distance between the Cβ–Cβ of corresponding residues in the chimera structure is 10.7 Å, shorter than the 13.7 Å in the Kv1.2 structure.
18504314:20	However, the equivalent residue to R294 in the chimera structure is actually a neutral glutamine (Q290).
18504314:21	In spite of the difference in sequence, the shorter distance is suggestive of the structural variability in the relative position of S4 and S5 in Kv channels.
18504314:22	The goal of the present study is to examine the possibility of engineering a histidine–histidine metal bridge between the voltage sensor domain and the pore domain in Kv1.2, and to use this information to refine our knowledge of the open-activated conformation of functional Kv channels in the membrane environment.
18504314:23	Mutant Kv1.2 channels were engineered with site-directed mutagenesis and assayed electrophysiologically in Xenopus oocytes.
18504314:24	In addition, computational models of the various mutants were constructed and simulated with MD.
18504314:25	The experimental methods and simulation methodology are described in the next section.
18504314:26	In the following sections, the results are first given and then discussed.
18504314:27	The paper is concluded with a brief summary of the main results.
18504314:28	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
The first atomic view of a voltage-gated K + channel was provided by the x-ray structure of the KvAP channel.
18504314:29	Although inconsistencies of this structure with other data were noted very early on ( ; ; ), the view that the KvAP x-ray structure was distorted into a nonnative conformation was recognized only after the determination of the x-ray structure of Kv1.2 ( ; ).
18504314:30	As a consequence, the recent history with KvAP and Kv1.2 might lead to the view that crystal structures are either detectably distorted (like KvAP), or are otherwise representative of the native conformation in all respects (like Kv1.2).
18504314:31	The reality is probably more complex.
18504314:32	In fact, assessing the functional significance of any protein conformation captured in a crystal environment is always a fundamental issue that must be addressed carefully.
18504314:33	The four highly conserved arginine residues along S4 are largely responsible for the gating charge controlling the voltage activation of the channel ( ; ).
18504314:34	Accessibility data show that membrane depolarization causes the S4 segment to move toward the extracellular side of the membrane.
18504314:35	In particular, the position of the first gating charge near the N terminus of S4 is an important marker of the conformational change that underlies voltage gating.
18504314:36	This first charge is known to alternate between two locations, exposed to the extracellular side of the membrane in the open-activated state of the channel, and displaced toward the intracellular side of the membrane in the closed resting channel state ( 2004; ).
18504314:37	To refine our knowledge of the open-activated state of Kv1.2, three different sources of information were taken into consideration: (1) the crystallographic x-ray structure (2A79), (2) electrophysiological measurements of Kv1.2 mutant channels, and (3) MD simulations of all the systems studied experimentally.
18504314:38	A first step is to obtain electrophysiological data leading to unambiguous interpretation.
18504314:39	In the results for the double mutant R294H-A351H are shown.
18504314:40	In the absence of Zn 2+, the mutant channels behave essentially as wild type.
18504314:41	However, in the presence of Zn 2+ the ionic currents of the mutant channels are significantly reduced, an effect that is not observed in the wild-type Kv1.2 channel.
18504314:42	In the presence of Cd 2+ the G-V relationship is shifted to a more negative voltage without any reduction of the current.
18504314:43	This phenotype is qualitatively similar to the R362H-A419H bridge engineered in Shaker.
18504314:44	Differences between the sequence of Shaker and Kv1.2 in this region could be responsible for the markedly different behavior.
18504314:45	As shown in two acidic residues near A351 at the extracellular end of S5 in Kv1.2 (D352 and E353) are neutral residues in Shaker (G420 and S421).
18504314:46	The Zn 2+ cation can be effectively coordinated by the nitrogen atom of histidine as well as by carboxylate ( ; ), but not so for Cd 2+, which prefers to bind softer ligands such as sulfur.
18504314:47	A reasonable hypothesis is that the negatively charged side chains, somehow, interfere with the activated position of S4 in the presence of the His-Zn 2+-His metal bridge, perhaps promoting some inactivation of the pore.
18504314:48	In fact, the double mutant R294H-A351H displays a slight shift of the G-V at very low Zn 2+ concentration before the current starts to collapse (see ).
18504314:49	This suggests that activation of the voltage sensor and inactivation of the pore involve two different processes, which are not affected in the same way by the formation of the bridge.
18504314:50	Although more work would be required to ascertain and characterize this phenomenon in wild-type Kv1.2, this is not our main interest here.
18504314:51	Rather, we try to recover the physical environment of metal coordination engineered previously in Shaker by substituting the neutral glycine and serine residues of Shaker back into Kv1.2.
18504314:52	As shown in the His-His metal bridge behaves essentially as the corresponding bridge in Shaker once the two acidic residues have been neutralized.
18504314:53	In particular, there is a shift of −27.4 mV in the G-V indicating that the open-activated state of functional channels is stabilized in the presence of Zn 2+.
18504314:54	In Shaker the corresponding metal bridge caused a shift of −40 mV.
18504314:55	The dissociation constant for Zn 2+ is 360 nM, which is quantitatively similar to the value previously reported for Shaker (400 nM).
18504314:56	The high apparent affinity is consistent with the conclusion that the Zn 2+ ion binds simultaneously to the two histidine side chains ( ; ; ), confirming that these positions are within atomic distance of each other in the open-activated state.
18504314:57	Furthermore, analysis of the deactivation rate from tail currents demonstrates that the observed effect clearly arises from a stabilization of the open-activated state promoted by the formation of the metal bridge, as opposed to a destabilization of the closed state.
18504314:58	The hyperpolarizing shift in the activation and the slowed deactivation rate are both consistent with an open-activated conformation that sits in a free energy well deepened by ∼2 k BT upon formation of the His-His metal bridge.
18504314:59	By comparison, the activation rate of the quadruple Kv1.2 mutant (R294H-A351H-D352G-E353S) slows down by less than a factor of 2 in the presence of Zn 2+ (see Fig.
18504314:60	S1, available at ), again indicating that the closed state of the channel is not destabilized by the formation of the metal bridge.
18504314:61	The structural interpretation of the effect of Zn 2+ as stabilizing a functional open-activated state is therefore unambiguous.
18504314:62	From a functional point of view, the open-activated state of the Kv1.2 channel is structurally stabilized by the formation of a His-His metal bridge engineered between position 294 in S4 and position 351 in S5.
18504314:63	The metal bridge promoting the activated open state is not unique, as it is also possible to engineer a bridge between R294H and D352H.
18504314:64	The voltage shift in the G-V is slightly smaller, −15 mV, which suggests that this metal bridge might be promoting a conformation that does not match the open-activated state as well as the R294H-A351H bridge.
18504314:65	In the x-ray structure of Kv1.2, the distance between those residues is on the order of 13.7 Å.
18504314:66	While this distance seems large, the implications for the formation of a His-His metal bridge must be ascertained carefully.
18504314:67	In crystal structures of metal binding proteins the Cα-Cα distance between residues involved in a His-His metal bridge can be as short as 5–6 Å.
18504314:68	However, in a fully extended position of the histidine side chain, it is also possible to form a bridge while keeping the backbone Cα separated by a distance of 9–10 Å.
18504314:69	Therefore, whether the formation of a R294H-A351H metal bridge stabilizing the open-activated state is truly inconsistent with the relative position of S4, with respect to the pore domain observed in the x-ray structure, needs to be clarified.
18504314:70	Simple arguments based on backbone-to-backbone distances are actually too simplistic, as one must also consider the relative orientation of the S4 and S5 helices, as well as steric clashes with neighboring residues.
18504314:71	Without further information, it is nearly impossible to assess the relative significance of the x-ray structure and of the functional data, and further advance our knowledge of the open-activated state.
18504314:72	Atomistic MD simulations of the Kv1.2 channel and the various mutants studied experimentally can help shed some light on this issue.
18504314:73	In a previous study of the Kv1.2 channel embedded in a lipid membrane, it was reported that residue R294 of S4 was shifting toward residue A351 of S5.
18504314:74	Furthermore, intersubunit salt bridges between the side chains of R294/R297 and D352 near the extracellular end of S5 from the adjacent subunit formed spontaneously during the simulation.
18504314:75	Similar observations were made in an independent MD simulation of Kv1.2 based on a different model.
18504314:76	Following the shift of the Cβ corresponding to the first side chain atom at position 294 is most informative.
18504314:77	As shown in the position of 294 in the simulation of the wild-type Kv1.2 form a wide cluster that is displaced roughly by 7.5 Å compared with the x-ray structure.
18504314:78	Although there is significant overlap with the configurations generated with the wild-type Kv1.2 channels, the simulations in which the R294H-Zn 2+-A351H bridge was imposed via a harmonic restraint form a more well-defined cluster.
18504314:79	A slightly more compact cluster of positions is obtained when the metal bridge is simulated in the background of the Shaker -like neutralized D352G-E353S mutations ( blue mesh).
18504314:80	Systematically, the shift in the position of the Cβ of 294 in S4 relative to the x-ray structure is observed for all simulations.
18504314:81	Interestingly, the x-ray structure of the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera channel (PDB id 2R9R) in the presence of a lipid environment displays a shift of ∼5.5 Å in a similar direction (the Cβ of Q290 is indicated by a green sphere).
18504314:82	The latter observation highlights the importance of a dynamic lipid membrane environment on the conformation of Kv channels, a point previously emphasized in crystallographic studies of the KvAP and Kv1.2 channels.
18504314:83	Before concluding this discussion, we wish to summarize the issue one more time for the sake of clarity.
18504314:84	The residues R294 and A351 are too far apart in the Kv1.2 crystal structure to allow the formation of the metal bridge that was previously engineered in Shaker . Only four possible reasons could explain this observation: (1) the Kv1.2 channel is slightly different from Shaker ; (2) the formation of the Zn 2+ bridge destabilizes the closed state of Kv1.2; (3) the metal bridge stabilizes a somewhat distorted open-activated state; (4) the conformation seen in the Kv1.2 crystal structure does not correspond precisely to that of the open-activated state of a Kv channel.
18504314:85	Several factors argue in favor of the latter explanation.
18504314:86	The possibility that Shaker and Kv1.2 are different (1) can be readily eliminated.
18504314:87	We were able to engineer the same S4–S5 high affinity metal bridge in a charge-neutralized mutant of Kv1.2 that worked previously in Shaker thus ruling out the possibility that those channels display any fundamental differences.
18504314:88	The possibility that the metal bridge stabilizes the closed state (2) is not consistent with the electrophysiological data.
18504314:89	As demonstrated by the rate of activation and the analysis of tail currents, the bridge is clearly stabilizing the open-activated state, as opposed to destabilizing the closed state.
18504314:90	The possibility that the metal bridge actually stabilizes a somewhat distorted open-activated state (3) deserves to be addressed carefully.
18504314:91	First, it is important to establish the magnitude of the distortion.
18504314:92	MD simulations of the mutant Kv1.2 channels indicate that a shift of ∼7–8 Å is needed to allow the formation of the His-His metal bridge, yielding an unambiguous structural constraint.
18504314:93	Second, it is important to recall that high affinity metal bridges (nM) are typically occurring in undistorted structures like active site of enzymes ( ; ; ).
18504314:94	To retain the high Zn 2+ affinity, the flexibility of the voltage sensor would need to be such that very little energy cost would be incurred by the structural distortion.
18504314:95	Furthermore, even in the case of a very freely flexible sensor with no energy cost, the loss of conformational entropy upon formation of the metal bridge would act to decrease the high Zn 2+ affinity.
18504314:96	In this context, the possibility that the metal bridge might actually stabilize some open channel conformation distorted by 7–8 Å at nM Zn 2+ concentration seems very unlikely.
18504314:97	This leaves the only possible alternative explanation (4): the crystal structure of Kv1.2 does not correspond precisely to that of the open-activated state.
18504314:98	According to the structural constraint deduced from MD, a 7–8 Å shift is needed to allow the formation of the His-His metal bridge.
18504314:99	It is particularly noteworthy that a similar shift—in the same direction—was already observed to occur spontaneously in unbiased MD simulations of the WT channel, without any biasing constraints between R294 and A351, and that a similar shift of about 4–5 Å—in the same direction—is also seen in the recent x-ray structure of the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera in which R294 is a Q.
18504314:100	This analysis gives us the confidence to conclude that the position and orientation of R294 in S4 in the activated and open functional state of the Kv1.2 channel in a fluid lipid membrane is shifted by ∼7–8 Å and rotated by ∼37° counterclockwise along its main axis relative to the x-ray structure 2A79.
18504314:101	As a consequence, the first two arginines of S4 are exposed to the water molecules near the bulk-membrane interface, or interact with the lipid headgroups as shown in MD simulations ( ; ).
18504314:102	Consequently, the picture emerging from the present results contrasts with the conclusion initially drawn from the x-ray structure that those side chains pointed directly into the lipid hydrocarbon.
18504314:103	The position of S4 in the open-activated state deduced here on the basis of functional data and MD simulations can be put within the context of a proposed atomic model of the voltage sensor in the resting-closed state ( ; ), which is consistent with a wide range of experimental constraints ( ; ; ; ; ; ).
18504314:104	According to the resting state model, the S4 segment is configured such that the first charge R294 points toward S1 and S2 ( ; ).
18504314:105	In this conformation, a salt bridge is formed between R294 and E226 in S2, previously identified experimentally using second site charge reversal mutations in the homologous Shaker channel where it corresponds to E283 ( ; ).
18504314:106	To reach this proposed resting state starting from the Kv1.2 crystal structure, the helix S4 must undergo a counterclockwise helical screw rotation of ∼180° along its main axis.
18504314:107	However, a more modest displacement and rotation of S4 would be required if the conformational transition started from the functional open-activated conformation proposed here.
18504314:108	In fact, when starting from the x-ray structure the charges R294 and R297 must initially move up toward the extracellular side before coming down in between S1 and S2, a process that presumably would not be accelerated by membrane hyperpolarization.
18504314:109	On a speculative note, this raises the interesting possibility that the crystal structure might have captured the channel in a conformation related to a zero-voltage inactivated state of the voltage sensor domain.
18504314:110	This functional state, which differs from the resting (down) state and the activated (up) state, manifests its existence as a history-dependent hysteresis in measured gating currents ( ; ; ).

21772662:1	Introduction 

				
				
				Rivaroxaban (Bayer AG, Germany) is a novel oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor not only of free FXa, but also of prothrombinase complex and clot bound FXa activity.
21772662:2	It displays potent antithrombotic effects in a variety of in vivo venous and arterial thrombosis models . 
In 2008, rivaroxaban received approval in the European Union and in Canada for the prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement surgery.
21772662:3	Two major clinical studies evaluated rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation  and in the treatment of venous thromboembolism . Besides its classical role in the prevention or treatment of thromboembolic diseases, rivaroxaban was also evaluated in a phase II clinical trial in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
21772662:4	The risk of clinically significant bleeding was increased in a dose-dependent manner, as compared with placebo.
21772662:5	Factor Xa inhibition was associated with a trend reduction of the primary efficacy endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or severe recurrent ischaemia requiring revascularisation.
21772662:6	Regarding the main secondary efficacy endpoint, rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke . The phase III study Atlas-ACS-TIMI 51 in patients after ACS is ongoing.
21772662:7	Atherosclerosis is a progressive, inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the arteries.
21772662:8	Although advanced lesions can grow sufficiently large to block blood flow, the most important clinical complication is an acute occlusion due to thrombus formation, resulting in myocardial infarction or stroke.
21772662:9	Often, thrombus formation is associated with rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic lesion, as the prothrombotic content of necrotic cores get exposed to circulating thrombocytes . 
The intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade converge at the activation of factor X to Xa.
21772662:10	Active factor Xa hydrolyzes and activates prothrombin to thrombin.
21772662:11	Increasing evidence showed that coagulation factors such as thrombin participate in atherosclerotic heart disease in ways that do not directly involve thrombus formation such as signalling through protease-activated receptors . Previous experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that ximelagatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, reduced lesion progression and promoted plaque stability in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice . Data on the vascular effects of new generation direct FXa inhibitors are very limited.
21772662:12	This prompted us to investigate whether administration of the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban attenuates progression and promotes stability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.

21772662:15	Results 
4. Discussion 
The present study demonstrates that long-term administration of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban reduces expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF- α MCP-1, and Egr-1 in aortic tissue of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.
21772662:16	Furthermore, rivaroxaban enhances thickness of the protective fibrous caps and reduces presence of medial erosions and lateral xanthomas, thus promoting lesion stability in this model of advanced atherosclerotic disease.
21772662:17	However, the reduction of progression of lesion size did not achieve statistical significance.
21772662:18	Factor Xa plays a central role in the coagulation cascade, linking the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by catalyzing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin on vascular cell surfaces . Factor Xa elicits various and complex signalling events on a wide range of cell types, by activating protease-activated receptors-1 (PAR-1) and PAR-2.
21772662:19	Factor Xa and thrombin share PAR-1, the main receptor for thrombin as a downstream cellular receptor . PAR-2 expression is enhanced in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions . Mediated through PAR-2, FXa acts as a powerful chemoattractant for fibroblasts and contributes to fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts . Interest in Factor Xa signalling was ignited after the realization that PAR-2, rather than PAR-1, acts as a key player in the progression of a wide pattern of pathologies at the fibroproliferative interface  . 

				
				Atherosclerosis is not only related to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques, but also considered a systemic inflammatory disease, which is modulated by genetic and environmental risk factors.
21772662:20	Sustained inflammation can lead to plaque rupture and thrombus formation with subsequent ischemia and myocardial infarction . In recent studies, Factor Xa has been found to trigger acute inflammatory responses in vivo   and in vitro  . In endothelial cells, Factor Xa leads to the activation of nuclear factor κ B (NF- κ B), the release of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), which contributes to leukocyte recruitment  . Most of these responses are mediated via PAR2 activation although some studies showed minor involvement of PAR1 . 

				Coagulation is closely united with inflammatory signalling pathways . Several studies have shown that anticoagulant treatment not only diminishes activation of coagulation but also inhibits inflammation, indicating the extensive interplay between these processes.
21772662:21	However, effects of rivaroxaban on lesion composition were, at least in part, unrelated to its antithrombotic activity.
21772662:22	The expression of tissue factor, a potent activator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade, was not different in thoracic aortas from rivaroxaban treated compared with control mice.
21772662:23	Significant thrombus formation was neither observed in the present study, nor in our previous studies of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the same model, possibly due to a high fibrinolytic activity in mice . 
Rivaroxaban is a small synthetic molecule able to inhibit free Factor Xa clot-bound and prothrombinase-bound Factor Xa.
21772662:24	Unlike indirect Factor Xa inhibitors, the effect of rivaroxaban does not require the presence of antithrombin . 
Factor Xa is also known to promote mitogenesis of serveral cell lines, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)  . Several studies demonstrated that inhibition of Factor Xa reduces VSMC proliferation , and restenosis after balloon angioplasty  .
21772662:25	At the molecular level, wound healing and fibrosis share similar mechanisms, including fibroblast migration, proliferation and subsequent differentiation into myofibroblasts that typically express α -SM actin . In renal interstitial fibrosis, there is a correlation between α -SM actin and PAR-2 expression . In the present study, there was also a trend towards reduced staining against α -smooth muscle actin in lesions of rivaroxaban treated mice, suggesting a potential effect of rivaroxaban reducing restenosis after ballon angioplasty, through its antiproliferative properties.
21772662:26	Interestingly, in contrast to our previous observations with simvastatin , frequency of intraplaque haemorrhage was not reduced by administration of rivaroxaban.
21772662:27	It is possible that in regard to plaque haemorrhage, plaque-stabilizing effects of Factor Xa inhibition were counteracted by its anticoagulatory properties, resulting in comparable patterns of erythrocyte deposition in otherwise more stable lesions.
21772662:28	Plasma levels of rivaroxaban were rather low in our study.
21772662:29	Bioavailability of rivaroxaban is poor in mice, compared to rats and other species.
21772662:30	Therefore, administration of a higher dose of the drug via the chow diet would not have necessarily resulted in significantly higher plasma concentrations.
21772662:31	It seems possible that higher plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban might have translated not only to anti-inflammatory and lesion stabilizing effects, as observed in the present study, but also to a significant reduction of lesion progression.
21772662:32	The rationale of using the present animal model was that long-term exposure to the drug in the genetically altered hyperlipidemic mice enables not only evaluation of lesion progression, but also, more relevant, of plaque composition.
21772662:33	It also allows an, at least indirect comparison, between direct Factor Xa inhibition and direct thrombin inhibition, as evaluated by us in a previous study . 
In our study, long-term administration of rivaroxaban (5 mg/kg/d) significantly decreased mRNA expression of Egr-1, IL-6, TNF- α and MCP-1 in mouse aortic tissue, clearly demonstrating anti-inflammatory properties of Factor Xa inhibition.
21772662:34	Mice, deficient in MCP-1 or its receptor CCR2, had significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that MCP-1/CCR2 interaction has a role in monocyte recruitment in atherosclerosis .
21772662:35	Although monocyte recruitment is an important proinflammatory event in atherogenesis, numbers of macrophages, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, were not reduced by rivaroxaban treatment in the present study.
21772662:36	Further studies are needed to evaluate whether Factor Xa inhibition reduces activity of macrophages rather than the actual number of inflammatory cells in advanced atherosclerotic lesions.
21772662:37	5.
21772662:38	Conclusion 
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that chronic administration of rivaroxaban can exert anti-inflammatory effects, stabilizing lesions in a model of advanced atherosclerotic disease.
21772662:39	Direct Factor Xa inhibitors might emerge as potential therapeutic tool in patients with established atherosclerotic disease.
19326190:0	INTRODUCTION 
Currently, most vaccines are administrated by injection.
19326190:1	Costs, risks and discomforts associated with the use and abuse of needles have boosted research on needle-free vaccinations.
19326190:2	Around 10 years ago, Glenn, G.M et al. reported for the first time data on transcutaneous immunization (TCI) and showed that strong immune responses could be induced by topically applied cholera toxin.
19326190:3	TCI is particularly attractive because of the high accessibility of the skin and the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the epidermis and dermis, in particular the Langerhans cells (LCs) and the dermal dendritic cells (DCs).
19326190:4	However, the upper layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, acts as a barrier for diffusion of macromolecules and therefore is a major obstacle to dermal vaccine delivery.
19326190:5	To overcome this barrier and achieve effective TCI, physical methods such as intradermal injection, thermal ablation, microdermabrasion electroporation and cavitational ultrasound have been used.
19326190:6	Physical disruption of the skin barrier increases the percutanous penetration of the antigen and makes the antigen more readily available for sampling by APCs.
19326190:7	Moreover, disruption of the skin barrier may induce a chain of molecular events that lead to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and facilitate APC activation.
19326190:8	A relatively novel approach to disrupt the skin barrier in a controlled manner with little pain sensation is the use of microneedle arrays.
19326190:9	It was proposed first by Gerstel and Place already in the 1970s.
19326190:10	Ten years ago, when the technology for fabrication in micron dimensions became readily available, Prausnitz resumed the study using microneedle arrays in transdermal drug delivery.
19326190:11	When used as a pretreatment, microneedle arrays enable antigens to diffuse along the transiently formed tiny conduits through the stratum corneum.
19326190:12	Thereby antigens may be able to approach the LCs in the epidermis and the DCs in the dermis.
19326190:13	Using ovalbumin-coated microneedle array, Matriano et al. evaluated the uniformity of skin piercing, and studied the dose of the vaccine used and the kinetics and magnitude of antibody titers induced in hairless guinea pigs.
19326190:14	Widera et al . investigated the influence of important fabrication parameters, e.g. length and density of the microneedles, area and coating of the microneedle arrays, on vaccination efficiency of TCI.
19326190:15	Hooper et al. reported that smallpox DNA vaccine-coated microneedle arrays applied topically in combination with electroporation protected mice against lethal challenge.
19326190:16	Recently, Van Damme et al. tested the injectable microneedle array in human volunteers using influenza vaccine, resulting in a comparable seroprotection rate as compared to i.m. injection with 5 fold dose sparing.
19326190:17	These interesting results show that TCI using microneedle array is promising.
19326190:18	However, after more than 10 years of extensive research, there continues to be a need for further improvement of microneedle array mediated TCI, e.g. by using potent adjuvants or novel ways of applying the microneedle arrays.
19326190:19	Recently a new electric applicator was developed in our lab.
19326190:20	It is designed to insert microneedle arrays into the skin with a predetermined velocity and thereby counteracts the elasticity of the skin.
19326190:21	This applicator enables us to reproducibly pierce human and mouse skin in vivo with microneedles with a length of 300 μm or less.
19326190:22	DT was recruited as a model antigen to evaluate the potential of microneedle array pretreatment in TCI.
19326190:23	In a previous study the immunogenicity of topically applied DT was dramatically improved by microneedle array pretreatment as compared to untreated skin.
19326190:24	The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of adjuvants on the quantity and quality of the immune response against DT after TCI with microneedle array pretreatment (M-TCI).
19326190:25	The Th1/Th2 balance of the immune response depends on several factors including the nature of the antigen and the adjuvant, the delivery route and the targeted APCs, as suggested by the ratio of IgG1/IgG2a antibody titers.
19326190:26	The adjuvants included in this study, cholera toxin (CT), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), synthetic oligo deoxynucleotide containing a CpG motif (CpG), immunostimulatory fractions extracted from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponica (Quil A) and aluminum phosphate (alum), differ in their adjuvant mechanism and ability to modulate the immune response (see Table ).
19326190:27	Immune modulation by these adjuvants was evaluated in (M-)TCI and compared with conventional subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of DT or DT-alum, by measuring serum IgG (subtype) titers and neutralizing antibody titers.
19326190:28	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
During the immunization study, there was no adverse effect from the shaving, anesthesia, piercing, immunization, or washing procedure observed.
19326190:29	Neither erythema nor induration was seen at the immunization site after exposure of antigen and adjuvants.
19326190:30	DISCUSSION 
This is the first study in which the immune modulatory activity of several known adjuvants was directly compared in TCI with microneedle array pretreatment, using DT as a model antigen.
19326190:31	In this study, we first compared the immune responses of DT formulated with different adjuvants in TCI and M-TCI.
19326190:32	Then we focused our study on the modulation capability of these adjuvants to the immune response in M-TCI.
19326190:33	Application of DT on intact skin did not induce a substantial immune response in the absence or presence of the tested adjuvants.
19326190:34	The poor penetration of DT across the stratum corneum seems to be the limiting factor, since the antibody titers of DT in TCI was strongly increased by microneedle array pretreatment.
19326190:35	The skin barrier disruption and increased DT diffusion across the stratum corneum provided remarkable improvement to the immune response via TCI, similar as the tape-stripping method, however, through a practically easier and more controllable approach.
19326190:36	Co-administration of adjuvants in M-TCI was able to further augment the immunogenicity of DT and demonstrated marked differences between the immune stimulatory activities of the adjuvants.
19326190:37	In the following section, the tested adjuvants are discussed individually concerning their mechanism of action and the role of delivery route in the augmentation and modulation of DT immune response.
19326190:38	CT is a molecule with five nontoxic B subunits (CTB) surrounding a single, toxic A fragment (CTA).
19326190:39	Both the CTB-mediated specific binding to the GM1 ganglioside receptors and the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of CTA have been reported to be of importance for the immune stimulatory properties of CT.
19326190:40	Whereas CT is a well-documented Th2 immune modulator in conventional and mucosal vaccination, our results point to a more Th1 biased response against DT when co-administered with CT via M-TCI.
19326190:41	The Th1 skewing of CT in TCI was also reported by Stickings et al. using mutant diphtheria toxin, CRM197, as model antigen and by Skountzou et al . using influenza vaccine.
19326190:42	This suggests that the Th1 skewing of CT is delivery-route dependent.
19326190:43	Studies performed by Anjuere et al. using ovalbumin as prototype antigen clarified that CTB suppresses systemic Th1 responses when given by a mucosal route, but potentiates these responses when administered by TCI.
19326190:44	This finding underscores the role of the epithelial microenvironment in the regulation of immune responses and reflects the DC heterogeneity between mucosal tissue and skin.
19326190:45	The signaling of CpG starts by engagement of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), followed by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g. IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ) expression, and results in a Th1 biased response.
19326190:46	In our present study, CpG induced the highest IgG2a titers among all M-TCI groups and our results strongly support a skewing of the Th1/Th2 balance towards the Th1 direction, similar to the immune modulatory effect of CpG in mucosal and injection vaccination.
19326190:47	Although at the site of application TLR9 is not constitutively expressed by the LCs, it is almost exclusively expressed by the keratinocytes in the upper and most differentiated layer of the epidermis.
19326190:48	Their TLR9 expression and reactivity to CpG is reported to be greatly up-regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF-α), a growth and differentiation factor present after skin barrier disruption and during wound healing.
19326190:49	Quil A is composed of immune-stimulatory fractions extracted from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponica . The Quil A concentration (1.43 mg/ml) used in the applied formulation was well above its reported critical micelle concentration of 0.3 mg/ml.
19326190:50	The average particle size of the DT-Quil A dispersion in PBS was about 56 nm with a PDI of 0.10, as measured by dynamic light scattering.
19326190:51	Quil A is a potent Th1 biased adjuvant when given by i.m. injection.
19326190:52	In M-TCI, it improved the IgG titers marginally as compared to the non-adjuvanted DT ( p  < 0.05 after the first boost; p  > 0.05 after the second boost).
19326190:53	The ratios of anti-DT IgG1/IgG2a titers were significantly lowered as compared to M-TCI of plain DT ( p  < 0.01), suggesting that it skewed the response towards the Th1 direction.
19326190:54	LPS, major outer membrane constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, stimulates APCs through TLR4, induces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and usually leads to a strong Th1 response.
19326190:55	The DT- lpxL1 LPS dispersion applied in our study had a bigger average particle size than Quil A, about 300 nm with a PDI of 0.45, indicating that relatively large complexes had been formed.
19326190:56	In M-TCI, the effect of the lpxL1 LPS mutant on the anti-DT IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and the neutralizing antibody titers was not significant ( p  > 0.05).
19326190:57	This may be due to the following factors: (a) LCs do not express TLR4 and do not respond to bacteria or LPS.
19326190:58	TLR4 expression by mouse keratinocytes also seems limited.
19326190:59	Besides few data available from mice, reports on TLR4 expression by human keratinocytes are conflicting; (b) Although little is known about the actual diffusion of these dispersions across the conduits induced by the microneedles, previous studies of our group showed that fluorescently labeled particles of ca. 200 nm did pass through the conduits created by the same microneedle arrays as used in the present study.
19326190:60	However, as no quantitative information is available, it is possible that only a limited amount of the DT- lpxL1 LPS dispersion reached the DCs in the dermis; (c) the LPS mutant may work in a less efficient way as the original LPS in the epidermal/dermal microenvironment.
19326190:61	Further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism.
19326190:62	The different reactivity of skin immune system to CpG and LPS may be involved in a strategic control of host defense to the bacterial commensal skin flora.
19326190:63	Alum did not show any adjuvanticity in M-TCI.
19326190:64	It induced lower IgG and IgG1 titers than those of non-adjuvanted DT group after each vaccination.
19326190:65	Furthermore, alum in M-TCI did not induce detectable IgG2a titers and provided no protection in the Vero cell test after the second boost (data not shown).
19326190:66	This may partially be due to the size of DT-alum particles, several microns in diameter, which prevents their diffusion through the conduits in sufficient amount to exert a ‘depot’ effect.
19326190:67	The adjuvanticity of alum could also be dependent on the epithelial microenvironment; the danger signal it induces through injection, the uric acid production, may not be provoked in the dermis and epidermis.
19326190:68	Interestingly, when comparing IgG subtype titers and neutralizing antibody titers between CpG and Quil A groups (Figs.  and ), the CpG group, with similar IgG titers, but much higher IgG2a titers than the other, induced similar to slightly lower neutralizing antibody titers, which indicates that IgG2a might not contribute to toxin-neutralization.
19326190:69	This was confirmed by the comparison between CpG and CT groups, also showing that higher IgG2a titers did not result in higher neutralizing antibody titers.
19326190:70	IgG1 seems to be the main neutralizing antibody for protection, as IgG1 titers significantly correlated with neutralizing titers.
19326190:71	However, IgG1 titers could not be used to predict individual neutralizing antibody titers with great accuracy, which is in line with a diphtheria vaccination study done in human infants.
19326190:72	Therefore, from an application perspective, CpG in M-TCI is more suitable for anti-viral immune responses such as influenza vaccination where IgG2a provides the main immune protection and a Th1 biased response is more desired.
19326190:73	In this study, a high dose of DT, 20 times of that used in the s.c. injection group, was applied in M-TCI.
19326190:74	This dose is similar to the dose of DT used by Glenn et al. in previous studies.
19326190:75	High doses were used as apparently only a fraction of DT applied actually enters epidermis/dermis.
19326190:76	A limiting factor for diffusion of the antigen into the skin is that the mice used for this study can only be kept under anesthesia for about 1 h.
19326190:77	This is not a limitation of the transcutaneous route, but a limitation of the animal model used.
19326190:78	The high doses used until now also indicate that formulation improvement to increase the efficiency of the immune response is very important in transcutaneous vaccination.
19326190:79	Conjugation and encapsulation of adjuvants into vaccine-containing particles and specific DC and LC targeting approaches could be attractive strategies to further improve the potency of vaccine formulations for M-TCI.
19326190:80	CONCLUSION 
We have shown that the type of adjuvant used has a significant effect on the immune response and protective immunity against DT in M-TCI.
19326190:81	The epithelial microenvironment and DC heterogeneity also play an important role in the regulation of the immune response.
19326190:82	This delivery method is applicable to many other vaccines by formulating with proper adjuvants and holds a lot of promise for future use.
20479879:0	Introduction 
Mechanoelectric feedback (MEF) is the process by which mechanical forces acting on the myocardium alter its electrical properties – . MEF has been demonstrated in mammalian studies ranging from isolated myocytes to in situ human hearts . In addition to the modification of action potential (AP) shape, MEF has been implicated in the generation of arrhythmias (see for reviews).
20479879:1	A mechanism by which MEF may be evoked is the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) – . If channels activated by hyposmotic swelling are excluded, two types of MSCs have been described in cardiac tissue: potassium selective MSCs (MSC K) and non-selective cationic MSCs (MSC NS) (see ).
20479879:2	MSC NS have a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential between 0 mV and −30 mV in physiological solutions – .
20479879:3	This means that they can potentially cause stretch-induced arrhythmias and early after depolarisations because their activation is predicted to move the membrane potential toward their equilibrium potential . The effect of stretch on the shape of the AP is dependent upon experimental conditions (see for review).
20479879:4	However, a specific manifestation of myocardial stretch that is of particular interest with regard to MEF is the ‘cross over effect’.
20479879:5	When stretch provokes an initial shortening of the early AP repolarisation time course and an elongation of late repolarisation, it causes a cross over with regard to the stretched and unstretched AP time courses . Such an effect is particularly consistent with the activation of MSC NS that have an equilibrium potential mid-way between the diastolic resting membrane potential and the peak of the AP upstroke . 
The influence of MSCs on the electrical activity of the intact heart has been studied by measurement of monophasic action potentials (MAPs) . MAPs are extracellularly recorded signals whose time course faithfully reproduces the time course of the intracellular AP . The use of MAP technology has not previously been extended to fish hearts.
20479879:6	Although MSC NS are highly implicated in the modulation of cardiac activity by stretch, their identity is still uncertain.
20479879:7	Evidence suggests that transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are non-specific cationic ion channels that are also mechanosensitive and more specifically that they may be involved in mechanically induced mechanisms in cardiac muscle (e.g. ).
20479879:8	Recent electrophysiological evidence in adult mammalian ventricular myocytes suggests a role for TRPC1 and TRPC6 . 
The fish heart is exquisitely sensitive to stretch through the Frank-Starling response which links cardiac output to venous return.
20479879:9	The Frank-Starling response relates the increase in muscle length (that accompanies myocardial stretch) to an increased force of contraction in all vertebrate classes (for review see ).
20479879:10	Fish are particularly sensitive to this mechanism and can increase stroke volume (SV) by up to 300% during strenuous activity . Consistent with this observation, single isolated piscine cardiomyocytes are highly extensible . The identification and characterisation of MEF in fish hearts is of particular interest given that one aspect of MEF in mammalian tissue is the provoking of arrhythmias while fish hearts can be subjected to sudden and large volume loads without provoking arrhythmias . 
We tested the hypothesis that MEF is present in fish ventricular myocardium.
20479879:11	To do this our first aim was to validate the use of MAP technology in fish myocardium.
20479879:12	Next, over a physiological range of input pressures (P is) and output pressures (P os), we investigated the effect of myocardial stretch on the electrical activity of the isolated working fish heart to provide evidence to support the presence and physiological activity of MSC NS-like channels.
20479879:13	Finally, we confirmed the presence of a candidate MSC NS channel, TRPC1, in the fish heart by cloning the channel and assessing its tissue distribution.
20479879:14	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Our MAP recordings are the first from a fish species and exhibit a time course and profile that is consistent with both the QT interval of the associated surface ECG and the intracellular APs recorded from isolated myocytes.
20479879:15	The upstroke of the MAP was slower than that of the intracellular AP, which is consistent with previous comparisons of MAPs and intracellular APs from mammals.
20479879:16	This is thought to be related to the fact that the MAP is recorded from a small area of tissue around the MAP electrode rather than a single myocyte and that there is a sequential alteration in current flow across this area of tissue . We recommend the use of the small flexible MAP electrodes designed for use in mouse hearts by Knollman et al . and conclude that MAP recordings are a valid technique for assessing electrical activity of the fish heart.
20479879:17	The range of P is used in this study are similar to those used in previous work on isolated trout hearts (e.g. ) and those used to generate maximum cardiac performance of the trout heart in situ .
20479879:18	The P os are similar to those recorded in the ventral aorta of trout swimming at 50% maximum prolonged swimming speed . We did not perfuse the coronary system in the current study as previous work has shown that gassing the perfusate with 100% O 2 ensures ample oxygen supply to working trout myocardium – . Indeed, the stroke work of our preparation (at comparable P is) is equal or greater than that achieved in a similar study where the coronary system was perfused .
20479879:19	Moreover, we show a similar increase in SV over a physiological range of P is as seen in vivo and in situ and SV does not decline rapidly at high input pressures, suggesting our preparation was working over physiological levels of distension . 
We found that the electrical properties of the isolated trout ventricle were significantly altered when subjected to raised P i and P o.
20479879:20	We show an initial stretch-induced shortening of MAPD25 in both the spontaneously beating and externally paced isolated heart.
20479879:21	This phenomenon was first reported in the frog ventricle and has since been reported in the mammalian ventricle .
20479879:22	This initial shortening is thought to be due to the hyperpolarising effect of active MSC NS (and possibly MSC K) driving the membrane potential to their respective equilibrium potentials . 
We saw no change in MAPD90 in the spontaneously beating heart.
20479879:23	Stretch increased heart rate and an increase in heart rate leads to a shortening of APD in fish while activation of MSC NS is predicted to lengthen MAPD90.
20479879:24	It was therefore possible that our observations in spontaneously beating hearts were an amalgamation of these two effects.
20479879:25	In addition to activation of MSCs, stretch may also alter intracellular Ca 2+ handling and thus Ca 2+ activated membrane currents .
20479879:26	However, when single trout myocytes, contracting auxotonically, were stretched there was no alteration in the intracellular Ca 2+ transient . 
At a fixed heart rate of 0.8 Hz, stretch caused a significant shortening of MAPD25 and lengthening of MAPD90.
20479879:27	These changes in MAPD25 and MAPD90 are similar to the previously described cross over effect attributed to the activation of MSC NSs , . If we scale our MAP amplitude to the trout intracellular AP amplitude reported by Harwood et al ., i.e. from 50 mV to −80 mV, our data gives a cross over point in the region of −25 mV.
20479879:28	Although this is a rough approximation, it does indicate the cross over within the expected voltage range for MSC NSs.
20479879:29	We also observed a stretch-induced increase in heart rate in the spontaneously beating trout heart, this is termed ‘the Bainbridge effect’ and has been observed in a variety of fish species .
20479879:30	Although it does not seem to be present in the in situ trout heart preparation of Graham and Farrell, it has been suggested that the Bainbridge effect may be more important in non-mammalian vertebrates which have less neurohormonal control over their hearts . The in situ preparation lacks neurohormonal control but the pericardium surrounding the heart is intact.
20479879:31	In the present study, we removed the heart from the pericardium so that the MAP electrodes could be placed in contact with the myocardium.
20479879:32	Future studies should address the role of the pericardium in MEF in fish.
20479879:33	Having found evidence to support the existence of MSCs in the rainbow trout ventricle, we used molecular methods to investigate the presence of TRPC1 (a candidate MSC) in rainbow trout cardiac tissue.
20479879:34	We found omTRPC1 in both the atria and ventricle of the trout heart to be similar to that of most other tissues apart from the brain, where expression was higher.
20479879:35	Although mRNA expression does not directly relate to protein expression, the study by Ohba et al. shows that expression of TRPC1 mRNA and protein are fairly well matched in the mouse heart.
20479879:36	The high expression of omTRPC1 in the brain is to be expected as TRPC1 is involved in processes such as growth cone guidance and the generation of the excitatory postsynaptic potential . 
The fact that omTRPC1 shares 83.8% homology with mammalian TRPC1 is promising as it may have similar mechanosensitive properties.
20479879:37	Unfortunately, it is not known which part of the protein confers mechanosensitivity and so it is impossible, at present, to asses if differences in mechanosensitivity are due to differences in the amino acid sequence.
20479879:38	In terms of the physiological importance of MEF and MSC NS in fish myocardium, the P o required (5.5 kPa) to significantly alter the MAP are comparable to those measured in swimming trout suggesting that MSC NS are of physiological significance when a fish is active.
20479879:39	As TRPC1 has been implicated in the promotion of mammalian cardiac hypertrophy it may be implicated in temperature-induced cardiac hypertrophy in fish .
20479879:40	This study provides the first MAP recordings from a fish species and is the first investigation into the effects of stretch on the electrical activity of fish ventricular myocardium.
20479879:41	There are three principal findings: MAP recordings are a valid technique for use in fish hearts; MEF operates in trout ventricle, within physiological extremes of P i and P o, in a manner consistent with the activation of MSC NS, and TRPC1 (a candidate MSC NS) is present in the rainbow trout heart and is broadly similar to its mammalian ortholog.
20479879:42	Thus our data are consistent with the idea that MEF is a common feature in the regulation of vertebrate cardiac muscle.
20479879:43	In addition, the T-tubule network has been proffered to explain why, despite recordings of whole cell currents carried by MSC NS, no study has successfully recorded single channel activity of MSC NS from mammalian ventricular myocytes . Adult trout ventricular myocytes do not possess a T-tubule network and therefore may provide a useful tool for further study of MSC NS in adult ventricular tissue.

21665924:0	INTRODUCTION 
The identification of functional motifs in proteins is an effective method to infer protein functions.
21665924:1	Different methods have been developed for extracting structural motifs (SMs) from proteins.
21665924:2	For example MegaMotifBase is a web server allowing the extraction from protein cores of SMs important for the three-dimensional (3D) structure in a given superfamily using sequence and structural feature conservation.
21665924:3	Other methods focus on functional SMs.
21665924:4	For example Webfeature and SitePredict extract SMs specific to a functional site and consist in learning the SMs of known functional sites.
21665924:5	Other methods such as GASPS, for which no server is available and FunClust look for conserved SMs in proteins with the same function.
21665924:6	In contrast to the other methods, these two methods do not start from a known functional site and are able to discover new functional sites within superfamilies.
21665924:7	Moreover, for all these methods, the extraction of SMs is based on structural alignment of proteins or the pairwise comparison of all fragments composing proteins by computing a root mean square deviation (RMSD) or distance between all fragments.
21665924:8	Thus, using these geometrical parameters, many functional motifs are extracted from secondary structures.
21665924:9	In spite of their large variability, loops are often involved in active or binding sites.
21665924:10	The structural alphanet HMM-SA is a collection of 27 structural prototypes of four residues called structural letters, permitting the simplification of all 3D protein structures into 1D sequences of structural letters.
21665924:11	It has been shown that HMM-SA is an effective and relevant tool for the study of protein structures, to study protein contacts, or protein deformations, to search for 3D similarity across proteins, to predict the conformation of peptides in aqueous solutions, and to extract structural motifs from protein loops.
21665924:12	Here, we present a new web server, named SA-Mot (Structural Alphabet - Motif), allowing the extraction of SMs, which are important both for structure and function of protein loops.
21665924:13	The first step, based on HMM-SA and the structural word notion, extracts SMs without pairwise comparisons of fragments.
21665924:14	Then, SA-Mot provides a description of each SM and identifies SMs of interest: recurrent and non random SMs with strong structural or amino acid sequence conservation and SMs likely to be involved in protein folding or function.
21665924:15	CONCEPTS AND METHODS 
WEB SERVER IMPLEMENTATION 
The purpose of SA-Mot web server is to allow researchers to easily identify SMs of interest in protein loops.
21665924:16	The SA-Mot web server has been designed with a user-centered approach.
21665924:17	Thus we tried to simplify the interface for new users that are not aware of all SA-W descriptors or statistics.
21665924:18	To improve the user-friendliness of the server, we emphasized direct help through contextual menus or relevant links in the documentation.
21665924:19	Results are concentrated on a single page, and are accessible by javascript hooks displaying layouts on-demand.
21665924:20	In order to guarantee the stability of the appearance and the functionality of the server, we used standard libraries.
21665924:21	This stability was checked on various operating systems and web browsers.
21665924:22	The duration of the process depends on the number and length of the chains of the target protein.
21665924:23	For example the extraction of SA-Ws of interest in protein 105M (PDB code) containing one chain of 153 residues lasts about 13 s.
21665924:24	The same extraction from protein 1BBR (PDB code) containing 10 chains with 11–250 residues lasts about 75 s.
21665924:25	USING SA-MOT 
In this section, we will try to illustrate a concrete search case in which SA-Mot could be of interest.
21665924:26	Our target is an uncharacterized protein: its structure is known and referenced in the PDB (2RHM) but its function has not been clearly established (putative kinase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus ).
21665924:27	Using DALI database, the structural closest protein (first hit) is the chain A of L-seryl-tRNA(sec) kinase of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (PDB code 3A4L).
21665924:28	This hit presents a RMSD of 2.8 Å and a sequence identity of 25% with chain B of the protein target (see ), suggesting a kinase activity of protein target.
21665924:29	This kinase activity is also suggested by CD-search web server that identifies different conserved domains in the region 1–130, see . 
SA-Mot server is then used to locate motifs of interest in protein loops of the protein target.
21665924:30	A part of the results for chain B is presented in . First, chain B contains rare SA-Ws at positions 130–141 suggesting it may be a flexible region.
21665924:31	We can observe that this region is located at the end of the conserved domain ‘Chloramphenicol phosphotransferase-like protein (CPT)’ detected by CD-search.
21665924:32	Then, we located 19 SA-Ws that are recurrent and overrepresented in the loop data set and presenting a weak structural variability and some amino acid specificities.
21665924:33	This suggests they correspond to SMs involved in crucial regions in the protein target.
21665924:34	One of these motifs of interest, ZCDS located at positions 25–31, corresponds to an ubiquitous word clearly associated with beta-turns.
21665924:35	Chain B of the protein target contains also four functional candidate words: YUOD, UODO, CDSK, OZGB . For two SA-Ws, CDSK and OZGB no available annotation was found to confirm their functionality that should be tested by experimental methods.
21665924:36	OZGB is located at positions 165–171 and is overrepresented in the ‘Trypsin-like serine proteases’ superfamily (SCOP id = 50494), suggesting that this SM is important for these proteases.
21665924:37	It is surprising that a putative kinase shares a structural motif specific to trypsin-like serine proteases.
21665924:38	However, this motif is not located in conserved kinase domains extracted from CD-search and it corresponds to a variable region in DALI alignment (see ).
21665924:39	Moreover, using SA-Mot to analyze the closest (kinase) proteins provided by DALI, we found that these kinases do not contain OZGB . These results suggest this SA-W may identify a SM important for the C-terminal region of the target protein but not be involved in kinase activity.
21665924:40	CDSK is located at positions 26–32 and is overrepresented in the superfamily ‘YVTN repeat-like/Quinoprotein amine dehydrogenase’ (SCOP id = 50969).
21665924:41	This suggests this SA-W is important for these dehydrogenase proteins.
21665924:42	It is located in kinase conserved domains detected by CD-search and in a bit conserved region in the DALI alignment.
21665924:43	Using DALI output, we observe that SA-W CDSK is found in uridylmonophosphate/cytidylmonophosphate kinases and adenylate kinases (for example PDB codes: 1QF9_A, 3UKD_A and 2C95_B), but not in L-Seryl-tRNA(sec) kinases (PDB code: 3A4L_A the first hit in DALI), putative gluconate kinases (PDB code: 2BDT_A the second hit in DALI), 6-Phosphofructo-2 kinases (PDB code: 1K6M_A).
21665924:44	This suggests that this SA-W is important for a putative function common to some protein kinases (uridylmonophosphate/cytidylmonophosphate kinases and adenylate kinases).
21665924:45	Overlapping SA-Ws YUOD and UODO located at positions 11–18, are strongly overrepresented in the superfamily ‘P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases’ (SCOPid = 52540).
21665924:46	These SA-Ws have been identified as SMs with residues involved in nucleotide-binding sites.
21665924:47	Moreover, the functionality of these two SA-Ws are confirmed by the fact they are located in the conserved domains with kinase activity detected by CD-seach and in a highly conserved region on DALI alignment (see ).
21665924:48	Thus, SA-Mot detects an ATP/GTP-binding site.
21665924:49	The extraction of the four SA-Ws of interest in DALI hits suggests the protein target is closer to uridylmonophosphate/cytidylmonophosphate kinases or adenylate kinases, proteins containing CDSK word like the target, rather than a L-Seryl-tRNA(sec) kinases, as suggested by DALI results, see . Thus, SA-Mot could be used in complementarity with DALI to order of DALI hits.
21665924:50	These four motifs of interest extracted by SA-Mot were not detected by other methods dedicated to the extraction of functional sites.
21665924:51	For example the extraction of functional sites from the protein target is impossible using the following web servers: MegaMotifBase, Webfeature, FunClust, because the protein target is not in their current databases.
21665924:52	SitePredict predicts a calcium-binding site in chain B at position 137 and a copper, iron, manganese, zinc-binding sites at position 132, but with a weak prediction probability (i.e. <60%).
21665924:53	PROSITE leads to the identification of no functional pattern.
21665924:54	The IBIS web server annotates the protein target as putative kinase and extracts a binding site to a benzoic acid.
21665924:55	In Swiss-Prot, the protein target (corresponding to the A9WDG5 id) does not contain any functional sites despite its annotation by the Gene Ontology term ‘ATP binding’ (molecular function).
21665924:56	We can observe that for this uncharacterized protein, there is no consensus between methods that extract functional motifs.
21665924:57	In addition to the knowledge of the putative kinase activity suggested by IBIS, Swiss-Prot, CD-search and DALI methods, SA-Mot results allow the location of ATP-binding site, that is the functional site needed for this activity.
21665924:58	SA-Mot also locates three other SMs of putative interest for target structure and function.
21665924:59	CONCLUSION 
SA-Mot is a new web server for the identification of SMs of interest extracted from protein loop structures.
21665924:60	It is based on two steps: first the extraction of all SMs from loops of protein structures, and secondly the description of all extracted SMs.
21665924:61	This description is based on statistics of SMs computed either on the loop data set or on SCOP superfamilies, on geometric and sequence parameters and is summed up in an interactive table.
21665924:62	SA-Mot allows the users to easily identify SMs of interest such as those involved in the structural and sequence redundancy and those with a putative role in protein structure or function.
21665924:63	Thus, in contrast to classical methods, SA-Mot does not focus only on the detection of a binding site associated with a ligand, but explores all crucial SMs for proteins such as motifs of interest for protein folding or structural motifs involved in active site or REPEAT regions.
21665924:64	Another interest of SA-Mot is that the learning of motifs of interest is not based on the knowledge of functional sites.
21665924:65	Thus, SA-Mot is able to propose novel SMs putatively important for the protein function.
21665924:66	In the current SA-Mot release, the overrepresentation of SA-Ws is computed in each SCOP superfamily.
21665924:67	As our method is effective for any protein classification, it may be extended to CATH superfamilies.
21665924:68	Moreover, SA-Mot only runs on proteins for which the 3D structure has been resolved but it could be extended to circumstances where only the sequence is known.
21665924:69	For this last case, we are currently developing a method to predict the SA-Ws of interest directly from amino acid sequences.
21665924:70	Then it will be possible to integrate this new method into the SA-Mot server to detect SMs of interest from protein loops using either the protein structure or the protein sequence.
21665924:71	Currently the only piece of information about the nature of the potential functional role of some SMs extracted by SA-Mot is provided by the id of the SCOP superfamily where a SM is overrepresented.
21665924:72	Thus, the next step of this work is the identification of the role of the functional candidate words.
21665924:73	It is clear that methods dedicated to functional motifs extraction are complementary between both them and methods allowing protein global structural comparisons such as DALI.
21665924:74	Thus, the next release of SA-Mot will be integrated in a meta-server including both local and global approaches in a high-throughput functional annotation pipeline.

18789163:0	Background 
Hepatitis C virus infection is hyper-endemic among injection drug user (IDU) populations , and evidence also suggests that excess HCV infection occurs in non-injection drug users (NIDUs) who administer heroin, cocaine, or amphetamine by other routes, such as inhalation or smoking . HCV is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in IDUs , and a leading cause of death among IDUs co-infected with HIV . 
Once the hepatitis C virus was identified in 1989, the availability of serologic testing for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) led to a large number of studies of anti-HCV prevalence in IDUs during the 1990s.
18789163:1	Four qualitative reviews of HCV epidemiology in IDUs were published by 2002; each summarized between 20 and 100 studies [ , ].
18789163:2	These reviews noted relatively high incidences, ranging between 6 and 40 seroconversions per 100 person-years (PY) of follow-up; the median incidence rates across the four reviews were 9, 12, 16, and 16/100 PY.
18789163:3	Anti-HCV prevalence varied substantially, between 30 and 90%.
18789163:4	Some of this variation was clearly related to time at risk, with a fairly consistent and relatively linear relationship between number of years injecting and increasing anti-HCV prevalence . Geographic variability was also noted in these reviews, for example, higher mean HCV prevalence was found in studies of North American IDUs (82%), as compared to European (67%) or Australian/New Zealand IDUs (59%) . Study year was also related to HCV prevalence, with the gradual emergence of reports of low-prevalence IDU samples in the literature.
18789163:5	Altogether, research suggested that HCV infection varied in IDU populations in relation to characteristics of person, place and time, and that insights into HCV prevention might be obtained via a systematic, quantitative review of available studies.
18789163:6	Fewer studies of HCV epidemiology have been conducted among NIDUs than among IDUs, and the etiology of HCV transmission in this population is not as well-understood, although some believe that exposure to HCV-positive blood occurs as a result of the shared use of pipes or straws to administer the drug . Excess HCV in NIDUs has been shown in a number of studies, with HCV prevalence reported between 1 and 35% , compared to 1.8% anti-HCV prevalence in the general population . Very few NIDU studies have closely examined route of HCV exposure, principally because they used a cross-sectional design, thus weakening the interpretation of a causal link between risk factors and incident infection.
18789163:7	Consistency in findings across studies, or consistency in explanation for variation across studies, may support an underlying causal relation between these forms of drug use and HCV.
18789163:8	A recent qualitative review showed that studies of strategies to prevent HCV infection in IDUs had inconsistent results, with few examples of interventions that reduce HCV transmission.
18789163:9	Moreover, the majority of studies had small sample sizes . Most HCV prevention efforts thus far have used strategies shown to decrease HIV transmission in drug users, including drug treatment, voluntary counseling and testing, and needle exchange programs.
18789163:10	It appears that their effect on HCV infection may be attenuated by several factors, particularly that HCV is more highly prevalent than HIV in IDU populations so that the probability of injecting with an HCV-infectious IDU is greater than injection with an HIV-positive injector.
18789163:11	Additionally, there are many more materials used to inject or prepare drugs that may transmit HCV infection in the injection setting.
18789163:12	Specifically, the shared use of syringes has been demonstrated to transmit HIV and HCV, but other equipment used to prepare drugs for injection (drug cookers and filtration cotton) may also transmit HCV [ - ].
18789163:13	Nonetheless, despite the lack of evidence showing an individual-level effect of various prevention strategies on risk of HCV infection, declining HCV prevalence has been observed in settings where comprehensive HIV prevention for drug users is widely available (such as large-scale syringe exchange and access to drug treatment) . Altogether, the published literature suggested that a synthesis of research on the epidemiology and prevention of HCV in drug user populations was needed to examine etiologic factors and drug or sexual practices that may reduce risk of HCV transmission, and to identify gaps in the literature.
18789163:14	This article describes the scientific scope of this systematic research synthesis study, the criteria used to select reports to include in the study, the methodology used to identify and code relevant reports, the system employed to assure accuracy and consistency in all phases of the project, and a summary of the study sample.
18789163:15	Other phases of the research synthesis study are also described.
18789163:16	Finally, our protocol for evaluating indicators of study quality and the studies in our sample are summarized.
18789163:17	Methods 
Results 
Overall, the HCV Synthesis Project has identified 2384 reports through the electronic search terms.
18789163:18	Of those, 948 (40%) reports appeared to be eligible for coding.
18789163:19	In most cases of ineligible reports, it was immediately apparent that the reports were review articles, were not reporting any original data, or did not report any data on either IDUs or NIDUs.
18789163:20	319 reports were initially classified as codeable, but were disqualified upon closer review.
18789163:21	The main reasons for disqualification were 1) no HCV prevalence or incidence data (n = 71); 2) drug user prevalence data aggregated, i.e., IDU and NIDU estimates were not disaggregated or distinguished from non-drug users (n = 64); 3) sample selection based on HCV status (n = 56); 4) results based on HCV-RNA testing alone (n = 9); and 5) self-reported HCV status was basis for prevalence estimates and no lab testing was performed (n = 26).
18789163:22	Other reasons for disqualification of reports were that no drug users were included in the report; data were incomplete for coding; the article included only a mathematical model; or the article was a review and did not include original data.
18789163:23	Thus, 629 codeable reports containing HCV prevalence rates, incidence rates and/or genotype distribution in injecting or non-injecting drug user populations published between January 1989 and December 2006 were identified.
18789163:24	Each report contained one of more of the following types of information: prevalence rates, incidence rates, genotype distributions and/or coinfection information.
18789163:25	Of the 629 eligible reports (some of which included more than one of the following types of statistics), 520 reported HCV prevalence statistics, 62 reported incidence statistics, and 118 reported genotype distribution.
18789163:26	Further, 345 also reported co-infection with HIV, HBV or HAV.
18789163:27	Of note, a given report (e.g., a published article) may contain more than one study if it provides separate data for samples collected in different locations, time periods and/or with different demographic data.
18789163:28	Therefore, one report may contain multiple studies, of either the same type (two prevalence studies, for example) or different types (a prevalence study and an incidence study, for example).
18789163:29	We have 794 studies overall, consisting of 599 prevalence studies, 72 incidence studies and 123 genotype studies.
18789163:30	Fewer than 10% of the reports included data on individuals meeting our definition of NIDUs.
18789163:31	More than 95% of all eligible reports were identified through Medline searches.
18789163:32	(Note that these numbers of reports do not eliminate overlapping reports from single studies.)
18789163:33	As shown in figure the number of publications reporting HCV prevalence in IDUs rose from 1–11 reports per year from 1989 to 1991, to 19–22 reports per year from 1992–1997, 33 reports in 1998, and between 27–52 reports per year after 1998.
18789163:34	The number of seroincidence reports in IDUs has risen more slowly and typically remained below seven per year, although in 2004 there were ten seroincidence reports.
18789163:35	The number of HCV genotype studies among IDUs has ranged between 4 and 16 per year since 1994.
18789163:36	The number of reports of HCV prevalence in NIDU samples per year has fluctuated between zero and ten.
18789163:37	Genotype and seroincidence in NIDUs are rarely reported, with no more than one report in any given year (data not shown).
18789163:38	The majority of reports collected data from western Europe (41%), North America (26%), Asia (11%) and Australia/New Zealand (10%).
18789163:39	We also identified reports which collected data from Eastern Europe (5%), South America (4%), the Middle East (2%) and the Caribbean (0.3%).
18789163:40	For a listing of the distribution of reports in the synthesis sample by country, see Table . 
Discussion 
Electronic searches of the published literature retrieved a substantial number of reports on the epidemiology of HCV infection in drug users.
18789163:41	The fact that nearly all eligible reports were discovered via Medline searches suggests that study data are relatively accessible for a meta-analysis.
18789163:42	Our search of the unpublished data has so far retrieved relatively few additional reports.
18789163:43	This is much higher than the 50% expected hit-rate using electronic databases . Thus, exclusion of pertinent data due to publication bias or other types of systematic omissions from our study sample are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to substantially bias our findings.
18789163:44	Funnel plots and other methods will be used to systematically examine publication bias (to judge whether studies with small samples and low HCV prevalence are missing from the literature).
18789163:45	The number of studies and reports related to HCV in injection drug users has been increasing over time, particularly since 1995.
18789163:46	Cross-sectional prevalence studies make up the majority of reports we identified; these will be useful in terms of identifying characteristics of person, place and time associated with extreme rates of HCV prevalence.
18789163:47	Because cross-sectional surveys are commonly used to characterize the epidemiology of HCV and other conditions in local drug user populations, understanding whether sampling methodology is associated with prevalence will help guide inferences regarding these data.
18789163:48	The number of seroincidence reports has grown over recent years, and this relatively large sample (n = 62) should permit greater exploration of sources of variability in seroconversion rates.
18789163:49	Synthesis of co-infection studies reporting HCV, HBV and HIV infection rates will provide insight into the joint occurrence of these infections and factors associated with similarities in their epidemiology in drug users.
18789163:50	Co-infection data and HCV genotype information will be relevant to health care planning, particularly the treatment of HIV/HCV co-infection and HCV mono-infection in drug users.
18789163:51	The scope and aims of the HCV Synthesis Project differ from typical meta-analyses which seek to combine effect sizes arising from studies of interventions or treatments.
18789163:52	Nonetheless, we adapted standard approaches to meta-analysis  to synthesize parameters of epidemiology.
18789163:53	The challenges we encountered in collecting and coding these data include lack of standard reporting of risk factor data, overlapping publication of data, and missing details on study methodology.
18789163:54	One notable finding from our summary of the HCV Synthesis Project data is that future research reports can enhance their contributions to our understanding of HCV epidmiology by clearly defining their drug user participants with respect to type of drug and route of administration, and by analyzing and reporting data separately in injection and non-injection users of drugs.
18789163:55	(Figure summarizes recommendations for future research on HCV among drug user populations.)
18789163:56	Had more studies disaggregated IDU and NIDU data, our sample of NIDU studies would have potentially doubled (provided that the NIDU sample fit our definition of non injection drug users who sniff, snort, or smoke hard drugs).
18789163:57	Unfortunately, a large number of studies that were ineligible for this reason were from developing countries for which HCV data are scarce.
18789163:58	The use of standard reporting methods, as promulgated by MOOSE , would enable data to be combined across a larger set of studies; this is especially important for HCV seroconversion studies which suffer from small sample sizes and low power to examine risk factors.
18789163:59	MOOSE developed recommendations for meta-analyses of observational studies of interventions and etiologic factors.
18789163:60	In general, we have followed their recommendations adapted to our specific research questions and the field of drug use related research.
18789163:61	For example, we did use broad inclusion criteria which has yielded a large sample size.
18789163:62	Despite the fact that meta-analysis is traditionally used to combine results from randomized studies, such as randomized control trials, the use of meta-analysis to combine results from observational studies is becoming widespread because of the many issues in public health which cannot be studied without the use of observational designs.
18789163:63	In order to apply meta-analytic techniques to sets of observational studies, it is necessary to develop homogeneous subsets, so that confounding factors do not overly influence the meta-analytic results . Heterogeneous sets of studies may be systematically described and sources of confounding or bias can be elucidated.
18789163:64	Conclusion 
Overall, we believe it will be essential to use meta-analysis to address outstanding questions regarding HCV prevention.
18789163:65	Because individual studies have failed to find evidence of specific protective factors for HCV in drug users (especially IDUs) and the etiology of HCV transmission in NIDUs remains somewhat vague, meta-analysis may prove to be highly useful in addressing endemic HCV in drug users.
18789163:66	For instance, combining data across seroconversion studies would substantially increase the ability to detect consistent and statistically significant risk factors.
18789163:67	Additionally, identifying in more detail the relationship between HCV prevalence and incidence and number of years injecting is essential for honing and targeting prevention efforts . 
For the HCV Synthesis Project, the data set is complete and data analysis is in process.
18789163:68	A report on HCV in NIDUs is published ; a preliminary analysis of the relationship of gender, duration and age to HCV in IDUs is in press ; and a report on the relationship of racial and ethnic status to HCV in IDUs is in preparation.
18789163:69	Future analyses in preparation will focus on complex questions of variability in HCV prevalence and incidence in injection drug users.
18789163:70	It is anticipated that this study will help to summarize the state of HCV knowledge, identify new research questions or those that need additional confirmation, and may point towards promising HCV prevention strategies.

20028552:0	Background 
Important cellular processes, such as differentiation and division, rely on signal transduction cascades that occur throughout the cell.
20028552:1	The signal transduction cascade, initiated by the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is essential for normal cell growth and development . Conversely, aberrant activity of the EGFR signaling cascade has been shown to play a key role in tumor cell growth and cell differentiation . Due to the complex inter-connectivity of the EGFR signaling network, it is difficult to identify conserved signaling modules and those specific control mechanisms that modulate the strength of EGFR signaling .
20028552:2	The high coupling of intermediate components within this signaling network has limited our ability to understand their functionality and how they affect the robustness of the overall pathway . 
The EGFR signaling cascade is initiated by the binding of EGF to the transmembrane EGFR at its extracellular domain.
20028552:3	The binding induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of its intracellular domains.
20028552:4	The dimers form docking sites for the recruitment of cytoplasmic enzymes and adapter proteins, starting a complex signaling cascade . The subsequent internalization and dissociation of the signaling complexes lead to activation of Ras-GTP by hydrolization of Ras-GDP . There are two principle pathways leading to this activation, the Shc-dependent and Shc-independent pathways.
20028552:5	The switch-like Ras-GTP plays a significant role in stimulating the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade . The end result of the cascade is phosphorylated ERK proteins that go on to regulate several cellular proteins and nuclear transcription factors important for cell growth and differentiation . In this way, the EGFR signaling cascade can be explained as being composed of various well-characterized biomolecular networks or pathways.
20028552:6	The dynamics of some of these smaller pathways, like the MAPK signaling and Ras signaling pathways, have been described under various cellular conditions [ - ].
20028552:7	The EGFR signaling cascade has come under increased attention following observations of increased levels of EGFR gene expression in cancers of the lung, colon, endometrium, and other areas with significant epithelial tissue.
20028552:8	A significant portion of that interest has been toward identification of highly conserved signaling modules or smaller pathways, which play a fundamental role in maintaining the robustness of the overall EGFR signaling network, and therefore, key to the persistent growth and development of tumour cells . 
Recent advances in the development of new programming languages to describe parallel computer systems has proven beneficial toward overcoming the challenge of describing highly complex and parallel biological systems .
20028552:9	One particular programming framework known as the stochastic pi-calculus has allowed a wide range of biological systems to be modeled and simulated.
20028552:10	The formal language of pi-calculus, originally developed for describing concurrent computational systems, specifies a framework to model large biological systems incrementally, intuitively building from simpler models of subsystems . In pi-calculus, interaction between multiple biological processes can be described as synchronous transmission of messages between the processes.
20028552:11	We can also represent biomolecules or complexes as processes, which allows transmissions to model chemical interactions or modifications of these molecules.
20028552:12	This view concentrates on the components, their states, and their reactions and may lead to significant succinctness in representation of the model .
20028552:13	The underlying semantics of these models incorporates stochastic behaviour through association of interaction rates with channels and by setting the delays between reactions stochastically according to these rates . A stochastic pi-calculus model can be efficiently simulated in a rigorous way that is faithful to chemical interactions.
20028552:14	This enables us to perform in silico experimentation, and provide guidance for future experimentation.
20028552:15	In addition, this modelling approach may be amenable to detailed analysis of the stochastic behavior of a network using model checking (cf ).
20028552:16	Previous studies of the EGFR signaling pathway have combined mathematical modeling and quantitative experimentation.
20028552:17	These studies revealed insights into the functionalities of the pathway  and feedback loops . By using experimental results to formulate and validate computational models, intrinsic behaviour of known EGFR modules can be explained at the system level.
20028552:18	For instance, observations from kinase assays and computational simulations indicate that the MAPK cascade is robust and its signal response is quite insensitive to transient stimuli or low reaction rates . Simulation of deterministic and non-deterministic models of the EGFR signaling cascade has demonstrated that signal responses to EGF stimulation becomes much more sustained as we move downstream in the cascade . The attenuation of signal response is also found to become more insensitive to varying levels of EGF stimulation as we move closer to the ERK protein at the end of the cascade . More recent studies using control analysis have suggested that only a small proportion of reactions substantially control signaling . In particular, the Raf protein, an oncogene, was highlighted as an important mediator in the signal response of phosphorylated ERK, but little is known about the mechanism by which this control is exerted.
20028552:19	The ability of the EGFR signaling cascade, as with many other receptor tyrosine kinase signaling systems, to maintain a reproducible output despite input variations can be attributed to the module diversity and redundancy that allows for compensatory functioning in case of component failure .
20028552:20	It is this robustness feature of EGFR signaling cascades which enables signaling in tumour cells to be so resistant to anti-cancer therapeutics.
20028552:21	But the high degree of reliance by the tumours on specific oncogenes or hub proteins in the signaling network gives us hope in identifying fragile sites in the network which may be possible targets for new drug therapies.
20028552:22	Here we present a modularized model of the EGFR signaling cascade within a single cell in the pi-calculus framework.
20028552:23	Our model is adapted from previous mathematical models describing the same pathway . Modules are not related to compartments in the cell and serve to emphasize the cause and effect relationships between different parts of the model.
20028552:24	Compartments in the cell are indirectly represented in the model through their effect on reaction rates, as is also the case in the original mathematical models.
20028552:25	Initial analysis shows that our model reproduces previous results.
20028552:26	We further analyze this model by simulation under knock-out perturbations.
20028552:27	These tests confirm the robustness of the upstream parts of the signalling pathway to perturbation; however, they also show that downstream parts of the pathway are less resistant to perturbations.
20028552:28	Analyses under multiple simultaneous inhibitions reconfirm this relative robustness of up-stream modules and sensitivity of down-stream modules.
20028552:29	Further investigation identifies positive feedback loops that help maintain stability of the signal under perturbations and negative feedback loops that help attenuate the signal and preserve its capacity over time.
20028552:30	The analysis suggests a modular view of the signal.
20028552:31	We suggest an abstract model concentrating on interfaces between the modules, which reproduces important behaviors of the pathway.
20028552:32	Analysis of the abstract model confirms the importance of redundancies in upstream modules to preserve system robustness.

Discussion 
This work presents a computational model of the EGFR signaling pathway.
20028552:34	The model, written in the stochastic pi-calculus language, represents our current understanding of EGFR signaling dynamics and the contribution of important signaling components to this pathway.
20028552:35	Execution of the model allowed us to simulate and observe signal transduction through the pathway under various conditions.
20028552:36	Some simulations match the experimental observations and increase our confidence in the model and its consistency with previous models [ , ].
20028552:37	Other simulations enable us to further analyze and hypothesize on the roles of different components in the pathway.
20028552:38	Our aim was to identify and analyze the control mechanisms associated with key components.
20028552:39	We simulated single knock-outs and multiple inhibitions of reactions.
20028552:40	Our choice for inhibitions is guided by a partition of the model into behavioral modules that are inspired by the biological understanding of importance of the different components in the pathway.
20028552:41	We could identify differences in network robustness and inhibition sensitivity between the different parts of the signal network.
20028552:42	The insights gained from simulation and analysis of the kinetic behaviour of the EGFR signaling pathway helps us understand not only the terminal signal response to EGF stimulus, but also the response at various levels of the signaling cascade.
20028552:43	The analysis suggests that there is high sensitivity in upstream components to variations in transient EGF stimulus, but this sensitivity does not translate to differential signal response in downstream components.
20028552:44	Specifically, sensitivity analysis reveals greater sensitivity in the EGF binding reaction and the Raf dephosphorylation reaction . In addition to this, the significant amplification of the EGF signal reported by the profile trace from the upstream signaling components to downstream components, even at low EGF dosages, highlights the importance of binding kinetics to the formation of the EGFR signaling complex . As suggested by previous models , and also apparent in our simulations, attenuation of signal response occurs after an apparent reduction in signal duration caused by decreasing levels of EGF stimulus.
20028552:45	It is clear from the results of the simulations at varying levels of EGF stimulus that in order to accurately predict the response to EGF stimulus, we need to break down our EGFR model and understand the functionality of intermediate signaling components.
20028552:46	Partitioning of the EGFR signaling network into modules is not a trivial task, but it leads to a simpler model of the signaling cascade which offers clarity and computational tractability . Identification of modules based on the clustering of network components and localization of signal control mechanisms is presented as an approach to attaining a simplified version of the EGFR signaling model.
20028552:47	The observed modularity of the EGFR signaling pathway has offered us an insight into the reuse of shared pathways in the cellular system.
20028552:48	We know that many biological networks have features suggesting that they have modularity, defined by the separability of its design into independently functioning units . Furthermore, these network modules show reuse in many different parts of the system, and allow for the construction of extremely complex systems by using simple building blocks . The common signaling modules identified in our model could be used as building blocks for models of other systems or more complex networks.
20028552:49	Reuse of these modules in future models would be very simple, because the stochastic pi-calculus implementation of our model allows for the code to be partitioned easily and integrated with other models implemented in the same language.
20028552:50	By comparing the results of the simulations in terms of signaling modules, we further verify differences between modules based on network characteristics, like redundancy and robustness to perturbations.
20028552:51	Some of these characteristics, such as the dependence of ERK-PP signal response on the activation of EGF receptors in the EGF module, may be an indication of why contact and tyrosine kinase inhibitors continue to be an elective means of preventing EGFR signaling . Our knock-out simulations confirmed the network robustness of the Grb2 module, which can be attributed to the forking of the activation signal into both Shc-dependent and Shc-independent pathways.
20028552:52	Although signal response primarily proceeds through the Shc-dependent pathway , as shown by lack of signal attenuation when reactions feeding into the Shc-independent Ras module are knocked out, significant redundancy and feedback mechanisms allow for signal retention when either pathway fails.
20028552:53	Also, another characteristic, present particularly in the Grb2 module and may be an explanation for the sustainability of signal transduction in the face of partial system failure, is the presence of numerous of reservoirs of Shc, Grb and Sos compounds that are involved in a number of reactions feeding into interface components.
20028552:54	It is then interesting to note that simulations conducted with other network models show the distribution of Sos to be higher in regions of the network with active signal transduction compared to regions disrupted by mutations . Such a result demonstrates the signaling network's ability to adapt and alter signaling component profiles when under unfavorable conditions.
20028552:55	In contrast, the lack of network redundancy and the lack of reservoirs of important compounds acting on various parts of downstream signaling modules results in greater network fragility for those downstream modules.
20028552:56	This places extra responsibility on the interface components (Ras-GTP, Raf-P, and MEK) to maintain signal transduction in the presence of an activating signal.
20028552:57	We provide evidence which shows that while the activity of Raf is in strong control of all characteristics of the transient profile in ERK phosphorylation , the combined activity of other downstream components may also have strong control over ERK phosphorylation.
20028552:58	Our simulation results suggest that extra sensitivity in the downstream regions of the EGFR signaling pathway may be exploited for the purpose of inhibiting EGFR signaling in tumour cells.
20028552:59	The ability to perturb a biological system without any cost, except for those that are computational, truly attests to the important practicality of conducting in silico experimentations on computational models.
20028552:60	More importantly, computational models have been widely used in the fight against numerous detrimental diseases by helping to determine possible targets for drug therapies.
20028552:61	Interestingly, through our tests to determine the effectiveness of targeting multiple inhibition sites as a means of combination therapy, we discovered a higher level of system sensitivity to targets in the downstream modules (Raf, MEK and ERK) as opposed to targets in the upstream modules (EGF and Grb2).
20028552:62	Specifically, we did not detect any evidence of significant attenuation of EGFR signaling when phosphorylation reactions in the upstream modules are targeted for partial inhibition, contradicting the results of analysis done on other mathematical models .
20028552:63	Since high sensitivity to reaction rates in the upstream modules were reported , it would not be surprising that discrepancies in these results are attributed to differences in reactions rates and initial conditions chosen by the different models.
20028552:64	Although our results may suggest that the combined inhibitory targeting of multiple downstream reactions in the EGFR signaling pathway could be an effective means of halting EGFR signaling in tumour cells, utilizing these sites as an actual drug target would be a daunting challenge due to lack of specificity, since these reactions appear in many important cellular processes.
20028552:65	As a means of compiling our observations of the various states that the components in the EGFR signaling pathway achieved under different conditions, and as a way of demonstrating model abstraction with the aid of models in the pi-calculus language, we produced a simplified connectivity diagram (Figure ).
20028552:66	The diagram depicts signal transduction through the EGFR signaling pathway abstractly.
20028552:67	We summarize the control mechanisms determining the activation state of an interface component.
20028552:68	From this graphical representation, we can easily identify relationships in the EGFR signaling pathway that are essential and those that are optional.
20028552:69	Essential positive feedback mechanisms shown in the diagram have been well studied and their ability to produce an actively maintained 'memory' of transient inductive stimulus in the MAPK signaling cascade has been characterized . While the negative feedback loops stemming from ERK-PP are shown to bring about adaptation and robustness to parameter variations, they can also induce dampened or sustained oscillations whenever activation attains certain threshold strength . The diagram also supports the notion that while single inhibition may lead to loss of signal output, dual inhibition may lead to partial restore of the lost function . Alternative methods of graphically describing the signaling relationships involving the EGFR pathway have been proposed , and although they seek to depict the enormous amount of information to be conveyed to each component in the network and describe the high cross-connectivity in the pathway, scalability becomes an issue with these methods and it would be difficult to systematically translate their graphical model to automata.
20028552:70	One can also argue that our diagram makes over-simplifications toward the discreteness of the signaling system, and non-apparent relationships between signaling components may be lost in the model abstraction.
20028552:71	In the case of the Grb module, removal of its redundant pathways in our pi-calculus simulations shows that signal transduction cannot occur without those redundancies.
20028552:72	However, as exhibited by simulation of the abstract model with the full Grb module reproducing signal transduction, the rest of the abstract model does capture essential parts of the signalling pathway.
20028552:73	This is why we present the connectivity diagram here as a summarization of the dynamics in the EGFR signaling pathway.
20028552:74	Since the EGFR signaling pathway can be described as a formal system, there is great opportunity for other complex biological signaling pathways to be modeled and validated using formal verification methods . 
In order to perform our analysis we have chosen to use the SPiM simulator, which is based on the pi-calculus formalism.
20028552:75	There is a wide range of existing tools based on process calculi, such as BetaWorkbench , Bio-Pepa , and Cellucidate , which all use Continuous Time Markov Chains as the underlying computational model.
20028552:76	Each tool has its own distinctive characteristics and advantages; for example, Cellucidate is a rule-based formalism, which directly models the reactions between components as opposed to the behaviour of the individual components themselves.
20028552:77	Rule-based modeling gives greater flexibility in describing the reactions of a biological system.
20028552:78	Bio-Pepa is, likewise, a reaction-based formalism in which the reactants and products can be described separately.
20028552:79	BetaWorkbench relies on an individual-based formalism, where each biological entity is encapsulated inside a boundary and local processes inside the boundary are used to model changes in state.
20028552:80	This extra layer gives more modeling flexibility but at the expense of additional complexity.
20028552:81	In general, expert modelers could have used any one of these languages to create the EGFR model presented here.
20028552:82	Our choice of SPiM was motivated by our interest in perturbed versions of the same model.
20028552:83	Using SPiM, we were able to automate thousands of model simulations using a simple command-line script.
20028552:84	In addition, SPiM's individual-based formalism, simplified language primitives, and its support for a graphical representation of models, simplified the creation and manipulation of this model.
20028552:85	In particular, the one-to-one correspondence between the graphical notation and program code allows both graphics and text to be used interchangeably.
20028552:86	Process calculi are rapidly establishing themselves as computational formalisms of choice for modeling molecular interactions.
20028552:87	Stochastic or hybrid versions of Petri Nets  can be viewed as a reaction-based modeling formalism that supports a range of powerful analysis techniques, though its core language is not as rich as process calculi.
20028552:88	StateCharts , on the other hand, provide an extremely rich language for modeling, but at present do not support exact stochastic simulation techniques and, like discrete versions of Petri Nets, are thus more appropriate to create abstract models of biological systems.
20028552:89	For a review of several computational approaches and their adequacy for different kinds of models we refer the readers to . 
Conclusions 
Through simulation of the EGFR signaling model under different perturbation conditions, we can discover regions of network robustness and fragility.
20028552:90	The molecular profiles of the important signaling components presents evidence for the increasing insensitivity to low EGF stimulus as we move down the signaling pathway.
20028552:91	In contrast, greater sensitivity is exhibited by the signaling system when downstream signaling modules are perturbed.
20028552:92	There seems to be significant redundancy that is contributing to network robustness in Grb2 and Ras signaling modules.
20028552:93	Further study of partial inhibition at the important reactions demonstrates that high signal attenuation is achieved when multiple sites in downstream signaling modules are targeted.
20028552:94	By analyzing the behaviour of interface components as the signal passes through the modules, we are able to produce a mapping of signaling modules to simplified operations, and thereby, generating a connectivity diagram for the EGFR signaling pathway.
20028552:95	From the diagram, we can see important feedback mechanisms, some of them crucial to the maintenance of activated response in ERK and could explain the irreversible maturation of tumour cells.
20028552:96	As is shown, the results from these simulations of the EGFR signaling pathway can be used to help formulate hypotheses, regarding the dynamics of EGFR signaling, to be tested in the 'wet lab'.
20028552:97	Furthermore, the experimental results can be used to eliminate spurious assumptions in the model and hence further verify it.

20723260:0	Background 
Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency . The recommended starting dosage for fesoterodine is 4 mg once daily, which can be increased to 8 mg once daily depending on patient response . In 2 pivotal phase III trials, fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg were significantly better than placebo in decreasing the number of micturitions, urgency episodes, and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes over 24 hours ( P < 0.01 for all comparisons) . In a post hoc analysis of pooled phase III data, improvements in UUI episodes per 24 hours, mean voided volume (MVV), treatment response, and continent days per week were significantly greater with fesoterodine 8 mg compared with fesoterodine 4 mg ( P < 0.05 for all comparisons) . In a separate pooled analysis of the phase III data, fesoterodine 8 mg was significantly better than fesoterodine 4 mg in decreasing the number of UUI episodes among subjects with moderate or severe UUI at baseline . 
The phase III trials evaluated only 2 doses of fesoterodine.
20723260:1	Although the post hoc analyses suggest a dose-related increase in efficacy, data from 2 doses alone do not permit a thorough assessment of the dose-response relationship of fesoterodine.
20723260:2	A pharmacokinetic study  and 2 phase II trials  included 3 doses of fesoterodine (4 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg), providing additional data for assessing the dose relationship of pharmacokinetic exposure and of clinical effects.
20723260:3	In the pharmacokinetic study , in which single doses of fesoterodine were administered to healthy male volunteers, increases in maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were dose proportional.
20723260:4	In the phase II studies , all 3 fesoterodine doses were efficacious in subjects with OAB, with a linear dose-related improvement seen in number of micturitions per 24 hours .
20723260:5	Although statistically significant differences were seen favoring the fesoterodine 8-mg dose over the 4-mg dose on key efficacy endpoints in the phase III trials, a dose-response relationship in the strictest sense cannot be established with fewer than 3 dose levels.
20723260:6	Therefore, mathematical models were developed to describe quantitative and predictive dose-response relationships of the effects of fesoterodine.
20723260:7	These models utilize individual subject-level, longitudinal data set from two Phase II and two Phase III studies.
20723260:8	Compared with the traditional analysis of the end-of-treatment results on study-by-study basis, this model-based dose-response characterization is more comprehensive because all available subject-level data obtained at each study visit after administration of 3 different dose levels (4, 8, or 12 mg) from a combined dataset across trials were analyzed.
20723260:9	The value of modeling and simulation in drug development is evidenced by its acceptability by drug regulatory agencies.
20723260:10	As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act of 1997, lawmakers stated that "data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness ." Modeling results may be accepted by the FDA to support or confirm efficacy , as illustrated by the prescribing information for gabapentin, for example, which notes that "pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses" . 
In addition to use in drug approval, models can be used to supplement clinical trial data by predicting outcomes for scenarios not studied in those trials.
20723260:11	Once the validity and reliability of the model have been established, values for dependent variables, such as dose response, can be calculated for any independent variable, such as time or drug concentration . Modeling and simulation can thus be used to predict effects of dose over time or time for a drug to reach maximum response in a typical patient, information of value to the practicing clinician making treatment decisions.
20723260:12	We describe here the use of modeling and simulation to define dose-response relationships for the clinical effects of fesoterodine on key bladder diary endpoints and postvoid residual (PVR) urinary volume in patients with OAB.
20723260:13	Methods 
A population analysis was conducted using pooled data from two phase II  and two phase III  studies.
20723260:14	The protocol for each study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site; a list of the institutional review boards is provided in Appendix I . All subjects provided written informed consent before study enrollment.
20723260:15	Each study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulations.
20723260:16	The phase III trials used in this analysis have been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
20723260:17	(NCT00220363 and NCT00138723).
20723260:18	The protocols for the phase II trials are available at ClinicalStudyResults.org (protocol numbers SP582 [A0221027] and SP668 [A0221029]).
20723260:19	The data set contained pooled response, demographics and covariates, time, and dosing information.
20723260:20	Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM software system, version VI; GloboMax LLC, Ellicott City, Maryland).
20723260:21	Individual estimates of parameters were obtained using POSTHOC, an empirical Bayes estimation method.
20723260:22	The random effect models sufficiently described the error distributions.
20723260:23	In the current modeling and simulation analysis, the developed models were evaluated for goodness of fit and then subjected to posterior predictive check (PPC) model evaluation.
20723260:24	Longitudinal modeling was incorporated to estimate the time when peak effects would be expected after treatment initiation.
20723260:25	Patient demographics, such as age, sex, and baseline OAB symptoms, were evaluated as covariates of treatment response.
20723260:26	Model simulations were used to describe expected response in patient subgroups of interest, for instance, by age and sex.
20723260:27	Results 
The structural parameters of the models were well estimated, with coefficients of variation (a measure of the precision of the estimates obtained) within 15% to 20% for each efficacy endpoint and within 35% for PVR.
20723260:28	The PPC results indicated good model performance in simulating the longitudinal data and the end-of-treatment change from baseline after treatment with fesoterodine versus placebo.
20723260:29	The treatment-effect estimates based on the final model parameters are summarized in Table . 
Discussion 
The principal goal of our work was to assess the dose-response relationship for fesoterodine, which was not possible using data from the phase III clinical trials, in which only 2 fesoterodine doses were administered.
20723260:30	To establish a reliable dose-response relationship, data from more than 2 doses are needed for modeling purposes.
20723260:31	By including in our models data from the 2 phase III trials and 2 phase II studies, in which 3 doses of fesoterodine were used, the dose response could be estimated.
20723260:32	The 12-mg dose data, along with data from the approved 4-mg and 8-mg doses, were used to anchor the models, particularly in evaluating nonlinear models, and to establish the appropriateness of linear models.
20723260:33	This model-based approach for defining the dose response allowed a comprehensive evaluation of individual subject-level data collected at each visit across 4 trials encompassing placebo and fesoterodine doses of 4, 8, and 12 mg.
20723260:34	The final models predicted a linear dose-response relationship for fesoterodine with regard to number of micturitions, number of UUI episodes, and increase in MVV and a nonlinear pattern for treatment response over time.
20723260:35	The values reported in table represent the final model parameter estimates.
20723260:36	The final model evaluations included Stepwise forward or backward comparisons.
20723260:37	The selection is based on the likelihood ratio test, across multiple models, each expressing different covariate-parameter combinations . The statistical significance is considered when there is a decrease in likelihood corresponding to a chi-square distribution with α = 0.01 and degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of estimated parameters between any two models.
20723260:38	These findings are consistent with the results from post hoc analyses of the phase III data, in which the fesoterodine 8-mg dose was significantly more effective than the 4-mg dose for several bladder diary variables, including number of UUI episodes  
The PPC for each efficacy endpoint indicated good model performance, with the distribution of the median predicted values centered on the observed change from baseline, indicating unbiased predictions . Overall, the models predicted that clinically significant effects would be seen within 3 to 4 weeks after initiation of treatment.
20723260:39	Of note, predicted peak response in number of micturitions and MVV was seen within about 3 to 4 weeks after treatment was started, with response plateauing thereafter, but number of UUI episodes continued to decrease even after 11 weeks of treatment.
20723260:40	The predicted change in number of micturitions is consistent with results from the 2 phase III trials.
20723260:41	In those studies, the least squares mean change in micturitions per 24 hours was -1.8 and -1.6 for fesoterodine 4 mg and -1.9 and -2.1 for fesoterodine 8 mg . Modeling predicted a decrease of -1.7 and -2.2 with fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively.
20723260:42	For UUI episodes, the model predictions were slightly lower than those obtained in phase III trials.
20723260:43	The least squares mean change from baseline in UUI episodes per 24 hours in the clinical trials was -2.0 and -1.7 for fesoterodine 4 mg and -2.2 and -2.3 for fesoterodine 8 mg , compared with predictions of -1.3 and -1.4 for fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg in the models.
20723260:44	For MVV, predicted results (increase from baseline of 23.9 mL and 38.1 mL for fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively) showed some similarity to those obtained in the phase III trials, in which the least squares mean change for MVV was 27.2 and 16.5 mL for fesoterodine 4 mg and 33.6 mL in both studies for fesoterodine 8 mg . 
A dose-dependent increase in PVR >100 mL was apparent in men and patients aged >70 years but not in women or patients aged ≤70 years.
20723260:45	The longitudinal profile of PVR did not show any relevant pattern, even in subjects who reached PVR >100 mL at some point during treatment.
20723260:46	The risk of acute urinary retention may be related to increases in PVR.
20723260:47	However, there is currently no threshold of PVR volume or relative increase in PVR that has been established as being associated with increased risk of AUR; 100 mL is a very conservative threshold, the clinical significance of which is unclear . The proportion of patients with PVR >150 mL was 2.4%, and only 0.5% of patients exceeded the PVR threshold of >200 mL.
20723260:48	For men starting treatment with an antimuscarinic, the risk of acute urinary retention, appears to be greatest during the first 30 days of treatment and particularly in the first 2 weeks . Consequently, as with other antimuscarinics, it may be prudent to monitor PVR in older men starting treatment with fesoterodine, at least during the first month of treatment.
20723260:49	The underlying clinical data for modeling fesoterodine response were derived from trials in which subjects were randomly assigned to a fixed-dose group, which differs from clinical practice where patients can modify their dosing regimen to target a desired level of treatment response.
20723260:50	While it might be perceived as a limitation of these analyses of fixed-dose studies as flexible-dose studies may be more clinically relevant, the latter are not suitable to elicit a pharmacologic or clinical dose response, which is best illustrated through fixed-dose studies.
20723260:51	A broader dose range could not be explored in these models as the clinical experience with fesoterodine, based on its benefit-risk assessment, was limited to the 4-12 mg dose range evaluated in Phase II trials and 4-8 mg in Phase III trials.
20723260:52	The fewer numbers of subjects at the 12 mg dose level are reflected in the somewhat wider confidence interval widths around the model-predicted response at that dose, particularly for micturitions and PVR.
20723260:53	Finally, the modeling included data from patients with demography typically represented in OAB clinical trials (about 80% females and average age 65 yrs); nevertheless the covariate analysis in these models helps predict the population under-represented in the trials.
20723260:54	Evaluating the dose-response relationship of new drugs is necessary to establish which doses will provide the greatest efficacy with the fewest adverse effects.
20723260:55	If the dose-response relationship is linear, then each increase in dose yields an increase in effect, whether positive (improved efficacy) or negative (worsened tolerability or safety), or both.
20723260:56	Dose-response data can be obtained from clinical trials, but inclusion of a large number of endpoints, such as multiple dosing regimens, is not appropriate for trial subjects and may not be feasible for investigators or sponsors.
20723260:57	Model-based drug development provides a supplemental means of assessing the risks and benefits of increasing drug dosage.
20723260:58	Although development of valid models can be complex and time consuming, modeling offers a reasonable and valuable approach to predicting the effects of increasing dose on clinical endpoints, information that may be useful in clinical practice.
20723260:59	In addition to supplementing or confirming data obtained in clinical trials, models can be used to simulate outcomes using variables not included in preclinical or clinical studies . These simulations can be used to predict the probability of an event and to evaluate the effects of covariates, such as subject age and sex; for instance, in our work, models were used to assess the probability of increased PVR in subgroups specifically stratified by age and sex.
20723260:60	Conclusions 
The results from our models demonstrate the value of modeling for increased understanding of the benefits and risks of modifying the dose of fesoterodine in treating patients with OAB.
20723260:61	The modeling and simulation results quantitatively demonstrate a dose-response relationship for the effect of fesoterodine on key clinical OAB endpoints.

17105655:0	Background 
The PGWBI questionnaire is a validated Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure, widely used in clinical trials and epidemiological research to provide a general evaluation of self-perceived psychological health and well-being [ - ].
17105655:1	In the late sixties Harold Dupuy, psychologist at the National Center for Health Statistics, developed his Psychological General Well Being Schedule, a questionnaire of 68 items to measure the degree of 'happiness' of the American population or the potential psychological distress.
17105655:2	The questionnaire was considered one of the first generic measures of health-related quality of life with specific interest to mental health.
17105655:3	Some years after Dupuy together with John E. Ware revised the questionnaire and a final version of 22 selected items was validated under the name of PGWB Index (PGWBI).
17105655:4	Extensive reference data of this version generated in the US general and patient population were published and fully described in 1984 in "Assessment of Quality of Life in Clinical Trials of Cardiovascular Therapies" . 
About ten years after the index was also introduced in Europe.
17105655:5	The PGWBI was adapted in many languages and cross-culturally validated for the use in several countries under the coordination of the MAPI Research Institute.
17105655:6	As a result different language versions of the PGWBI are available for use on the MAPI website . 
In Italy various research activities concerning the field of Outcome Research were started in the framework of the MiOS project, a multidisciplinary initiative to study in depth different kinds of subjective outcome measures for the health assessment.
17105655:7	In 2000 as part of the MiOS project, the PGWBI was validated in a representative sample of 1129 Italian citizens above 15 years of age.
17105655:8	The results of this study were published of the Italian user manual and were recognized as reference data for the self-perceived health in the Italian general population [ - ].
17105655:9	During the same period the MiOS group validated also the Italian version of the Short Form-12 (SF-12) derived from the original longer version of the SF-36 . The successful validation of the SF-12 set the ground for the development of an abbreviated and more user-friendly version of the original PGWBI.
17105655:10	The reason for the reduction of items was to achieve a higher acceptability of the questionnaire in the population, aiming for shorter times of administration, better response rates and lower rates of missing data.
17105655:11	The main objective of this study was to reduce the number of items of the original 22-item PGWBI while keeping adequate validity and reliability of the questionnaire.
17105655:12	The step-wise approach to identify the best and most relevant set of items and the results of the application of the new PGWB-Short (PGWB-S) in various settings, including samples of general and specific patient populations, are described in this paper.
17105655:13	Methods 
Results 
During the step-wise selection process six items were identified to predict 90% variance of the summary score when the original long questionnaire was applied to a random sample of the Italian population.
17105655:14	Item 20 alone reached 60%, whereas Items 7, 21, 5, 6, 18 and 2 added an additional 15%, 8%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively (Table and Figure ).
17105655:15	These items were confirmed to become part of the new 6-item structure of the questionnaire.
17105655:16	In order to evaluate the performance of the new instrument, one thousand four hundred and forty three subjects were evaluated in the different settings.
17105655:17	Socio-demographic characteristics varied accordingly to the case-mix evaluated: the mean age ranged from 21.5 years in the study involving University students to 51.3 years for the sample representing the general Italian population.
17105655:18	The gender distribution ranged from 11 % to 50 % of males among the studies (Table ).
17105655:19	The step-wise selection process previously applied to Study 1 confirmed the relevance of the six items identified in the development sample of the previous DOXA Study.
17105655:20	Six items predicted 88% variance of the summary score when the long questionnaire was applied to Study 2 sample.
17105655:21	Item 20 alone reached 55%, whereas Items 21, 7, 6, 5, 18 and added an additional 11%, 9%, 6%, 4% and 3%, respectively.
17105655:22	As to the acceptability indicators, response rates of satisfactory 100% were reached in all studies (Table ).
17105655:23	No missing and out-of-range data at item level were registered for any of the samples.
17105655:24	Descriptive statistics of raw item scores are presented in Table according to the different studies.
17105655:25	As expected, the sample of the University students reported the highest mean value of the summary measure (75.3; range 44–106), while the lowest was reported by the sample of hospital patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (71.5; range 63.7–79.4).
17105655:26	In the sample of the University students where both versions of the questionnaires were self-administered in a cross- over design, the mean value of the summary score of the long form (74.8; range 41–105) confirmed the results of the short form.
17105655:27	The subjective mental health perception was measured without specific relation to the perceived physical health, therefore overall values did not show differences between groups and were relatively stable across studies.
17105655:28	The patterns of correlation between the summary scores and the single items according to the different studies are presented in Table . Subjects in the general population had the lowest correlation between the single item and the summary score, whereas the highest correlation with the summary score was observed for the items of the University students.
17105655:29	The lowest correlation estimates in all studies was observed consistently for 'item 18' regarding the question on self-control (range 0.52 – 0.72), whereas the highest correlation (0.89) was observed in study 2 for 'item 05' regarding anxiety.
17105655:30	The internal consistency measuring the extent to which the items are interrelated were expressed by the coefficients Cronbach's Alpha calculated for each study.
17105655:31	Table shows the coefficients Cronbach's Alpha obtained for the PGWBI and the PGWB-S in the individual study settings.
17105655:32	The smallest value was 0.80 and the highest 0.92, indicating that the summary score showed good internal reliability.
17105655:33	The coefficients Cronbach's Alpha were all above 0.80 showing acceptable reliability, also when compared to the one (0.94 in DOXA Study and 0.96 in Study 2) of the original instrument in full length (22 items).
17105655:34	Finally, Table reports the sex-adjusted summary scores for the age groups in study 1 when compared to the study in which the original PGWBI was administered.
17105655:35	Mean values of the summary scores decreased with age ranging from 85.4 in the young to 71.7 in the elderly and 81.8 to 63.9 in the individual studies.
17105655:36	The impact of ageing on the self-perceived mental health can be observed.
17105655:37	In the past, a clear age trend has been documented for physical health measures, while the mental health measures have shown to be less sensitive to the age effect [ , ].
17105655:38	The raw summary scores given for study 2 and 3 although referring to restricted age groups and small sample sizes fitted into the overall age trend observed in the two large field trials in the Italian population.
17105655:39	Discussion 
The extensive international experience with the original PGWBI and the many data generated in recent years [ - ] were the basis on which it has been possible to perform a meaningful item reduction resulting in the development of a new shorter instrument in Italy.
17105655:40	The aim of this study was to identify the lowest number of items, which would be sufficient to maintain the validity of the original questionnaire.
17105655:41	We identified 6 items that reproduced at least 90% of the variance of the PGWB summary Index through multiple step-wise regression analysis.
17105655:42	Compared to the PGWBI, where the global summary score is generated by summing up 22 items pertaining the six subscales, the new PGWB-S is constructed on the basis of only six items representing five of the six original subscales.
17105655:43	When tested in various samples of the Italian population the acceptability (response rate, missing data) and validity of the PGWB-S demonstrated a satisfactory performance of the PGWB-S across strata.
17105655:44	The good compliance expressed by absence of missing data was probably favoured by the structured person-to-person interviews in study 1 or the self-administration in controlled settings in study 2 and 3.
17105655:45	Nevertheless it is worth mentioning that the relatively short time necessary to answer the six questions of the questionnaire might have contributed positively to this result.
17105655:46	With respect to validity, the global summary scores varied across the different groups, reflecting the expected degree of variation related to the baseline characteristics of the participants.
17105655:47	The relatively high values of the Cronbach's alpha coefficients observed in the samples indicate a good reliability of the questionnaire when compared to the Gold Standard of the original PGWBI.
17105655:48	In spite of the slightly lower precision of the 6-item questionnaire in comparison with the original, the PGWB-S came out to be a robust instrument, suitable as a generic measure of HRQoL and a good tool for population surveys, where it can be easily administered.
17105655:49	Our study has a few limitations that should be considered.
17105655:50	The first pertains to the method adopted to select the relevant items.
17105655:51	Alternatives methodologies are indeed often used alone or in combination for this purpose, such as item-total correlations using Cronbach's alpha coefficients, and principal components factor analysis.
17105655:52	Our choice was essentially based on the experience on the development of the SF-12 that has the advantage to be straightforward, easy to be replicated and comprehensive to be understood by lay people.
17105655:53	On the other hands, we cannot exclude that other methods could yield different outputs.
17105655:54	One might also argue that present results, in terms of item selection and performance of the new shorter index might be result of the specific characteristics of the development and validation samples.
17105655:55	Waiting for further independent validation of our exercise, in order to add information about the performance of the new questionnaire, we further tested the robustness of our findings by performing a cross-validation in an independent sample of 755 cases, extracted from an on-going clinical trial where the original (long) PGWBI was used together with other patient-reported measures . In this data set, we first replicated the step-wise item procedure to cross-validate the selection of the PGWB-S and then estimated how well the PGWB-S developed in the original DOXA sample would explain the variance of the longer 22 item questionnaire.
17105655:56	As to the item selection, the first 6 items explained 92% of the variance, 3 were the same as in the DOXA sample, while the other 3 were different but pertaining the same scale of the items present in the DOXA sample.
17105655:57	The 6 original items ranked, indeed, in the first top-ten.
17105655:58	In addition, the original 6 items explained more than the 90% of the variance of the longer index from the 22 item questionnaire.
17105655:59	Finally, when the amount of variance explained was estimated in each sex and age strata, the figures ranged from 90.2 to 95.1%.
17105655:60	It is important to keep in mind that at the current development status the generalizability of the findings are exclusively confined to the Italian setting, and results cannot be transferred to other cultural and linguistic settings.
17105655:61	We cannot exclude that additional analyses of foreign data from other countries could ultimately lead to a different item selection.
17105655:62	Nonetheless, these results can be considered as a first step in the validation process of the PGWB-S, and as a promising starting point for future research on this matter.

null:0	Introduction 
In the European region, smoking, which is influenced by cultural and sociodemographic factors , has stabilised during the last decade at approximately 30% for adults .
null:1	However, the variations between countries are great, and in Sweden the smoking prevalence has decreased to 19%, the lowest in Europe.
null:2	The declining smoking trend is even more obvious among pregnant women and among parents of infants . Twelve percent of Swedish pregnant women were smokers in 2000, compared to 25% in 1990 . The same positive trend is reported from the United States, where smoking prevalence among pregnant women has decreased from 16% in 1987 to 12% in 1996 .
null:3	This is a promising development but not satisfactory, as it has been shown that most mothers resume smoking shortly after giving birth . 
Interventions are done both on public and individual levels.
null:4	Common ways developed by society in many countries to strangle tobacco use and minimise ETS pollution in different settings include taxes on tobacco products, restrictions on marketing of tobacco, warning labels on tobacco products, legal restrictions on smoking in public places (schools, theatres, public transport, etc.) and restrictions on buying tobacco . In this respect, however, the home is a more difficult target for tobacco control, although it has been found to be the main source of children's ETS exposure . Different health promotion activities, including tobacco issues, are in use during childhood in Sweden today, starting with antenatal care and proceeding through child health care and school health promotion programs, reaching practically all children aged 0–19 years as well as their parents.
null:5	During the last decade intensified efforts have been made to develop effective methods to help parents-to-be and parents to stop smoking or change their smoking behaviour . 
The exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) enhances the risk of negative health effects  and of the children becoming smokers themselves .
null:6	This and the fact that the prevalence of smoking among Swedish 16-year-olds has been unchanged the last decade (boys 30%, girls 36%), indicates that the efforts aiming to diminish tobacco use must continue . Occasionally smokers are included in these yearly investigations.
null:7	Protecting children from ETS exposure is especially crucial during the first years of a child's life, since it is known to be a sensitive period in terms of the child's future health .
null:8	This is also a period of life when they spend most of their time with their parents, therefore it is important to increase the knowledge of smoking behaviour in the home and how it is influenced by different factors.
null:9	Public opinion on ETS exposure has changed for the better in society and most parents are aware of the importance to protect the children from ETS.
null:10	However, the major source of exposure for children is the home.
null:11	Jarvis  recently reported that ETS exposure is not following the current positive trend in society, indicating that smoking parents are not successful in their efforts to protect their children against ETS exposure.
null:12	The physical or mental health of a parent who smokes could moderate whether the parent takes precautions to eliminate ETS from the child's environment, such as always smoking outdoors with the door closed.
null:13	In research on smoking, generic instruments of health status, like SF-36 (Short Form-36)  are shown to be valuable to elucidate the associations between tobacco use and physical, as well as mental and social, aspects of health.
null:14	This is important in smoking cessation interventions.
null:15	SF-36 has been used to compare smokers and ex-smokers with never-smokers in other studies.
null:16	Wilson et al  showed a clear trend toward lower scores, in all dimensions of quality of life, among smokers than for never-smokers and ex-smokers, and lower scores among heavy smokers than for moderate and light smokers.
null:17	Considering that smoking in society probably will not be eradicated in the foreseeable future, it is crucial to study characteristics of smoking parents to find effective ways of supporting them in their efforts to minimise their children's exposure to ETS.
null:18	A better understanding of the smoking behaviours and health status of parents with different age children, compared to smoking behaviours of age-matched adults without children, will provide valuable information for planning additional intervention to reduce childhood exposure to ETS.
null:19	Using a general household survey on a random sample, with focus on adults at the age when they are settling down and having children, the principal aim was to study whether having children affects adult smoking prevalence and/or smoking behaviours in the home, and how much importance survey subjects placed on protecting the indoor environment from ETS.
null:20	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Our results indicate that parenthood had an impact on attitudes toward protecting the environment from ETS and smoking behaviour, but having dependent children did not show a significant impact on smoking prevalence.
null:21	Smoking parents showed lower scores in several domains in self-perceived health-related quality of life measured with SF-36.
null:22	The participant rate was 63% in the main study; today it is difficult to get higher response rates in epidemiological studies like this, in Scandinavia . The analyses showed good agreement between the random sample (A), the respondents in that sample (B), the sample for the complementary study (C), and the respondents of this (D).
null:23	The prevalence of daily smokers in the geographical area of the study was also equal to the current Swedish national prevalence.
null:24	Education, known to influence smoking prevalence , was about the same in the study population as in the general population.
null:25	Smoking prevalence and prevalence of having preschool children were also equivalent between the groups.
null:26	The age groups for parents were chosen because they are the ages when starting a family and having children is most common.
null:27	Older and very young parents were not included, and judging from other studies  this may have resulted in an underestimation of smoking prevalence among parents.
null:28	These groups are, however, small in Sweden  and thus did not impair the study results to any great extent.
null:29	Other limitations are that women during their first pregnancy have been misclassified as non-parents in the analyses, and during pregnancy and infancy smoking habits often are unstable.
null:30	The instruments used in this study were not tested for validity or reliability.
null:31	However, the main study comprised widely used questions as well as a validated instrument (SF-36), and the complementary questions for this study were designed, scrutinised by specialists, and pre-tested.
null:32	We also had to rely on statements from those who are responsible for the ETS exposure, and since the issue must be considered delicate, this could have underestimated smoking prevalence and overestimated the use of precautions . 
The smoking prevalence among parents of pre-school children in this study was compared to annual statistics from The National Swedish Board of Health and Welfare . In 1998, national statistics on smoking among mothers and fathers  showed that 12% of mothers and 15% of fathers of 8-month-old children were registered as smokers in the children's records at the Child Health Care units.
null:33	The number of smokers in this report might be underestimated since missing data tends to exceed the number of reported smokers.
null:34	The higher smoking prevalence in our study, 27% among parents of preschool children, can also be explained by the inclusion of occasional smokers and parents of older children, as well as by the fact that the questions were asked anonymously and the respondents were not asked in their capacity as parents.
null:35	This might have had an impact on the result since the combination of smoking and parenthood has become socially unacceptable . 
The higher smoking prevalence among parents of school children might be associated with the less intensive tobacco prevention work in antenatal clinics as well as in Child Health Care at the time when this group of parents attended these, and thus might be considered as a positive evaluation of this work.
null:36	Having children was significantly associated with outdoor smoking.
null:37	The younger the children, the more important outdoor smoking seemed to be, which is in accordance to Eriksen and Bruusgaard's study in Norway . This may be a result of the increased awareness and efforts among nurses in Child Health Care, as well as low tolerance of passive smoking in general.
null:38	Non-smokers, parents of preschool children and higher-educated adults with and without children considered it more important to protect the indoor environment from ETS.
null:39	However, 33% of the study population stated that it was impossible to protect the home from ETS as long as a single member of the household is a smoker, regardless of the precautions taken.
null:40	This kind of attitude has been shown to lessen the motivation to take protective measures and encourages a more fatalistic mindset . The results of this study can hardly support or refute this theory, but stress the need for further research on the effectiveness of different precautions.
null:41	The use of SF-36 gave valuable information behind the statistics on a number of smokers and non-smokers.
null:42	Differences in health-related quality of life between smoking and non-smoking parents of dependent children were obvious with SF-36.
null:43	In this study we have compared young (20–44 years) parents of dependent children and found that smokers had significantly lower scores in "general health," "vitality," "social functioning," "role-emotional." and "mental health" than non-smokers, results indicating that smoking can not be seen as an isolated issue.
null:44	In many cases it is one problem among others, but one important question, raised by these results, is the impact of quality-of-life on the ability to adapt a protecting smoking behaviour in the home.
null:45	However, logistic regression models did not show any significant impact of the 8 SF-36 domains on how important it was considered to protect indoor environment.
null:46	Only "mental health" had an impact on smoking prevalence and smoking behaviour, indicating that the ambitions are the same in all groups, but the ability to fulfil one's intentions is less when variables measured in the domain "mental health" are lower scored.
null:47	Other studies have shown that in a general population smoking prevalence is higher among groups with reduced mental health . Therefore it is necessary to consider the special needs, social, political and economic, of these groups when planning strategies to support these parents in their efforts to protect their children from tobacco smoke.
null:48	This study shows that adults, with or without dependent children, smoke to the same extent.
null:49	The results indicate that national surveys of smoking prevalence give a good approximation of the percentage of children with parents who smoke.
null:50	Preschool children spend most of their time in the home.
null:51	In this study, smoking occurred in 27% of the households with preschool children, thus putting these children at risk of ETS exposure.
null:52	However, the knowledge of the hazardous health effects of ETS on both smokers and non-smokers seems to have made most parents aware of the importance of protecting the children from ETS [ , ].
null:53	This study indicates that parenthood is associated with smoking behaviour and attitudes toward passive smoking, but not to smoking prevalence.
null:54	It points out the need for further research on how effective commonly used precautions are, as well as finding new ways of protecting the children from ETS.
null:55	It is also important to find out how interventions, aiming to support smoking parents in their efforts to protect their children from ETS, should be designed.

19701482:0	Introduction 
Egg size, both absolute and relative to others within the same clutch, may significantly influence the competitiveness of hatchlings within the nest and the survivorship of offspring (Rutkowska and Cichon ; Taborsky et al. ). Consequently, varying egg size is one way that parental birds are able to affect the size and fitness of their young (Slagsvold et al. ; Grant ; Slagsvold and Amundsen ).
19701482:1	Egg size has also been found to vary with either environmental conditions or parental quality in many studies (Wiebe and Bortolotti ; Horak et al. ; Potti ; Karell et al. ), adding an additional layer of complexity to the vast literature on avian investment strategies through varying clutch size.
19701482:2	Here, we investigate egg and clutch size variation in the cooperatively breeding acorn woodpecker ( Melanerpes formicivorus ) with the specific goal of testing for a relationship between these variables and access to supplemental provisioning provided by helpers that may enhance reproductive success.
19701482:3	The hypothesis that females might adjust egg size depending on such aid has recently been proposed by Russell et al., who found that female superb fairy-wrens ( Malurus cyaneus ) breeding with helpers lay smaller eggs of lower nutritional quality than females breeding without helpers.
19701482:4	This reduced maternal investment by females, subsequently compensated for by additional provisioning by helpers, offers a resolution to the paradox in fairy-wrens and potentially other cooperatively breeding species where the presence of helpers provides no clear enhancement of reproductive success (Dunn et al. ; Cockburn ; Magrath and Yezerinac ).
19701482:5	Like superb fairy-wrens, female acorn woodpeckers reduce their feeding rate when assisted by helpers, but the overall total feeding rate per chick increases with increasing group size (unpublished data).
19701482:6	Thus, maternal load-lightening (Heinsohn ) occurs in both populations.
19701482:7	In contrast to superb fairy-wrens, however, helpers and other additional group members in acorn woodpeckers are generally associated with increased number of young fledged per group (Koenig and Mumme ).
19701482:8	More recent analyses (see below), however, indicate that there are significant differences in helper effects depending on the sex of helpers and on the size of the prior year’s acorn crop, a critical food source for this species (Koenig and Mumme ).
19701482:9	These differences in apparent helper effects suggest several specific predictions (detailed below) as to how breeding females should reduce investment in their eggs if they are engaged in a reproductive strategy similar to what has been described in fairy-wrens.
19701482:10	Materials and methods 
Results 
Overall, egg size varied significantly depending on several variables (Table  ).
19701482:11	Eggs were significantly wider and significantly larger in volume when temperatures prior to egg-laying were warmer and longer but significantly smaller in volume when the prior year’s acorn crop was good.
19701482:12	Clutch size did not vary significantly with either the prior year’s acorn crop or mean minimum temperature prior to egg-laying.
19701482:13	None of the variables considered varied significantly with the number of breeder males in the group.
19701482:14	There was no significant relationship between clutch size and any of the three mean egg size variables.
19701482:15	Contrary to prediction 1, females laid significantly more, rather than fewer, eggs when assisted by female helpers (Table  ).
19701482:16	Also, mean egg length was shorter when aided by male, but not female, helpers, again inconsistent with the hypothesis.
19701482:17	There were no significant differences in egg size related to whether or not birds were aided by female helpers.
19701482:18	Prediction 2 posits a significant acorn crop × helper male interaction in the direction of egg or clutch size being smaller in poor acorn years when assisted by male helpers.
19701482:19	No such interaction was evident from the mixed-effects models, where none of the acorn crop × helper male interactions was significant (Table  ).
19701482:20	There was, however, a significant acorn crop × helper female interaction in the analysis of egg volume.
19701482:21	In order to visualize these results, we divided years into “good” and “poor” years as in Table  and plotted the mean effect of helper males and helper females on egg volume.
19701482:22	The results (Fig.  ) suggest that, although not statistically significant, eggs were smaller in poor, but not good, acorn crop years when birds were assisted by helper males, as predicted.
19701482:23	Helper females, however, exhibited the identical pattern, where the result was statistically significant.
19701482:24	Discussion 
A major issue in the field of cooperative breeding has been to understand the fitness consequences of helpers.
19701482:25	This has been particularly problematical in species in which helpers do not appear to increase reproduction (Cockburn ).
19701482:26	In the case of acorn woodpeckers in central coastal California, helpers overall correlate with increased reproductive success.
19701482:27	However, the apparent fitness consequences of helpers differ depending on the year and the sex of the helpers.
19701482:28	Male helpers enhance reproductive success, but considerably more so in good acorn crop years, when each helper corresponds to an additional 0.45 fledgling, than in poor acorn crop years, when each helper corresponds to only 0.10 offspring (Table  ).
19701482:29	In contrast, helper females do not significantly enhance reproductive success in either good or poor acorn crop years.
19701482:30	This sex bias in helper effects is opposite the pattern of helper females increasing productivity more than helper males proposed by Cockburn to be a potentially general phenomenon in cooperative breeders.
19701482:31	To the extent that females exhibit any pattern, it is the opposite of helper males, with helper females enhancing reproduction more in poor acorn crop years (0.16 offspring per helper) than in good acorn crop years, when their effect is on average slightly negative (−0.05 offspring per helper).
19701482:32	Despite these differences, the sex ratio of offspring is only slightly biased towards males (Koenig et al. ), and helper females are nearly as common as helper males in this population.
19701482:33	Given their apparent failure to confer any fitness benefit, how can this high frequency of female helpers be explained?
19701482:34	One potential resolution of this paradox is that females invest less in eggs when assisted by helper females (in all years) and helper males (in poor acorn crop years), thus concealing the beneficial effects of helpers whose help subsequently serves to make up for the initial handicap conferred on the clutch by breeder females.
19701482:35	This phenomenon of concealed helper effects has recently been documented in superb fairy-wrens (Russell et al. ), where females were found to lay smaller, lower-quality eggs when assisted by helpers, thus leading to helper effects that are otherwise not evident in the population.
19701482:36	A similar case of apparently adaptive adjustment of offspring size has been documented in fishes by Taborsky et al., who found that female Neolamprologus pulcher (Cichlidae) lay smaller eggs when assisted by helpers, an effect they postulate is due to the lower predation suffered by offspring attended by helpers in this species.
19701482:37	Whether a similar phenomenon occurs in other cooperatively breeding species has yet to be determined.
19701482:38	In the acorn woodpecker, the differences in apparent helper effects vis-à-vis the sex of helpers and the acorn crop suggest two predictions if concealed helper effects are present.
19701482:39	First, females should lay smaller or fewer eggs when assisted by helper females but not helper males; and second, in poor, but not good, acorn crop years, females should lay smaller or fewer eggs when aided by helper males; whereas, either no pattern or the opposite pattern should hold for groups with helper females.
19701482:40	Contrary to the first prediction, birds did not lay smaller or fewer eggs when assisted by female helpers; rather, females laid significantly larger clutches when assisted by female helpers and significantly shorter eggs when assisted by helper males (Table  ).
19701482:41	Consistent with the second prediction, females tended to lay smaller eggs in poor, but not good, acorn crop years when assisted by helper males.
19701482:42	However, contrary to the prediction, the identical pattern was observed when females were assisted by helper females.
19701482:43	Thus, when aided by helpers, females laid smaller eggs in poor acorn years and larger eggs in good acorn years (Fig.  ).
19701482:44	These results fail to support the concealed helper effects hypothesis in this population.
19701482:45	The patterns revealed by these analyses do, however, suggest adaptive adjustment of egg size by females related to ecological conditions other than helpers, including environmental temperatures and the food supply as indicated by the prior year’s acorn crop.
19701482:46	The effects of these factors were not all clear-cut; for example, although eggs were significantly longer when the prior year’s acorn crop was good, overall egg volume was significantly smaller in good acorn crop years, and there was no significant relationship between clutch size and the acorn crop.
19701482:47	Thus, females in this population do not necessarily lay larger eggs when breeding conditions are favorable, as has been documented for other species (Cunningham and Russell ; Kontiainen et al. ).
19701482:48	Even clutch size was not significantly related to resources in these analyses, although on an overall annual basis, there is a significant correlation between mean clutch size and the prior year’s acorn crop ( r  = 0.46,
19701482:49	N  = 28 years, P  = 0.02).
19701482:50	One potential reason why the concealed helper effects hypothesis might fail is if females are unable to predict the amount or quality of help they can expect to receive (Russell et al. ), but this is not the case in acorn woodpeckers where helpers are generally offspring from prior years and are rarely failed breeders joining the group late in the season after eggs have hatched.
19701482:51	Thus, breeding females should be able to assess the number of helpers likely to be present prior to the breeding season.
19701482:52	A second reason would be if egg nutritional quality was adjusted by females independently of egg or clutch size (Nager et al. ) in a way that corresponds with the concealed helper effects model, a finding reported (along with reduced egg size) in superb fairy-wrens (Russell et al. ).
19701482:53	We were not able to test for egg quality in this study, and thus the hypothesis that concealed helper effects are found in acorn woodpeckers cannot be completely rejected.
19701482:54	However, insofar as the size or number of eggs laid by females is concerned, reduced maternal investment at the egg stage does not appear to be the general phenomenon in cooperative breeders proposed by Russell et al..
19701482:55	Within a clutch, varying egg size has the potential for allowing very fine adjustments of subsequent competitiveness within broods (Rutkowska and Cichon ).
19701482:56	However, at the level hypothesized by the concealed helper effects hypothesis, varying egg size is a relatively crude way of adjusting parental investment in reproduction compared to adjusting clutch size or feeding rates (Hatchwell ).
19701482:57	Feeding, in particular, is an activity that takes place over a much longer time period and involves far more energy than the production of eggs.
19701482:58	Consequently, we consider it unlikely that modifying egg size as a means of adjusting overall parental effort will turn out to be a common strategy in cooperative breeders.
19701482:59	In contrast, load-lightening by breeders, reducing their feeding rates when assisted by helpers, is a commonly observed phenomenon in cooperative breeders (Hatchwell ; Heinsohn ).
19701482:60	Load-lightening offers a potential alternative explanation for the failure of some cooperative species to exhibit an increase in reproductive success with group size if breeders reduce their own investment when assisted by helpers such that the total feeding rate remains constant (Hatchwell ).
19701482:61	In the case of acorn woodpeckers, analyses suggest not only that females reduce their feeding rate when assisted by helpers, but that, like superb fairy-wrens, breeder females reduce their feeding rate more in response to the presence of helpers than to changes in brood size (unpublished data), a result indicating that the marginal costs of parental care are greater than the marginal benefits (Hatchwell ; Russell et al. ).
19701482:62	Thus, adjustments of parental care are being made in the acorn woodpecker relative to helper presence, but for the most part, these adjustments appear to be primarily at the nestling rather than the egg stage.
21292629:0	The Limited Transfer Window Hypothesis 
The movement of organelle DNA to the nucleus has been, and remains, a driving force in fashioning eukaryotic genomes ( ; ).
21292629:1	Early on in both mitochondrial and plastid evolution, there was a massive migration of organelle genes to the nuclear genome ( ; ; ); thus, present-day nuclear DNA is a mosaic of endosymbiont-derived organelle genes and “host” genes; and contemporary mitochondrial and plastid DNAs (mtDNAs and ptDNAs) are significantly more reduced than the endosymbiotic genomes from which they evolved ( ; ).
21292629:2	Aside from adding to the gene repertoire of nuclear genomes, organelle-to-nucleus DNA transfer events have generated, and continue to generate, forms of noncoding nuclear DNA (and occasionally exonic nuclear DNA, ) that share sequence identity with the coexisting organelle DNAs; these types of sequences are referred to as nuclear mitochondrial DNAs (NUMTs) and nuclear plastid DNAs (NUPTs) ( ; ).
21292629:3	Although the nuclear genomes from at least 85 eukaryotic species have been analyzed for NUMTs ( and references therein), there are relatively little data on NUPTs.
21292629:4	This is because, until recently, there were only a small number of published nuclear genome sequences from plastid-harboring eukaryotes.
21292629:5	Nonetheless, an intriguing observation has come from the NUPT data that are available: Species with one plastid per cell (monoplastidic) have fewer NUPTs than those with many plastids per cell (polyplastidic) ( ; ; ).
21292629:6	For example, the monoplastidic protists Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Plasmodium falciparum have <2.5 kb of NUPTs ( ; ), whereas rice, which contains upwards of 100 plastids per cell, has around 900 kb of NUPTs.
21292629:7	A possible explanation for these observations is that in monoplastidic species, the transfer of ptDNA to the nucleus is greatly reduced as compared with polyplastidic taxa because 1) there are fewer plastids to donate ptDNA to the nucleus and 2) lysis of the plastid would almost certainly result in death to the cell, unlike the case for polyplastidic species ( ; ; ).
21292629:8	This explanation has become known as the “limited transfer window hypothesis”.
21292629:9	When presenting this hypothesis, predicted that “the sequencing of the nuclear genomes of organisms containing a single plastid should always reveal a low abundance of NUPTs.”
21292629:10	But a lack of nuclear DNA sequence data from monoplastidic species and from plastid-harboring taxa in general has made this prediction difficult to test.
21292629:11	In this study, we take advantage of newly available genomic sequence data from a series of diverse mono- and polyplastidic species to formally investigate the limited transfer window hypothesis.
21292629:12	Altogether, we calculate the number and accumulative length of NUPTs in the nuclear DNAs of 11 polyplastidic and 19 monoplastidic (or effectively monoplastidic) eukaryotes.
21292629:13	When possible, we also analyze these same genomes for NUMTs and compare these data with the corresponding NUPT statistics.
21292629:14	Testing the Limited Transfer Window Hypothesis 
To assess a genome for NUPTs, at least two things are required: complete nuclear DNA and ptDNA sequence data.
21292629:15	We found 30 species for which both these statistics are available, including 13 land plants, 7 green algae, 5 apicomplexans, 3 stramenopiles, 1 haptophyte, and 1 red alga.
21292629:16	The sources for these genome sequence data are listed in and ( online).
21292629:17	To the best of our knowledge, detailed NUPT statistics for the majority of the above-mentioned taxa have not been published elsewhere.
21292629:18	For 20 of these species, complete mtDNA sequence data are also available, allowing for NUMT as well as NUPT analyses.
21292629:19	Although most of these taxa have already been explored for NUMTs ( and references therein), we performed our own NUMT investigations because in the past differences in search parameters among studies have led to discrepancies in NUPT/NUMT tabulations.
21292629:20	We did try, however, to use similar search constraints as those employed in previous reports: BlastN with an expectation value of 0.0001.
21292629:21	Another source of discrepancy in NUPT/NUMT assessments among earlier studies were instances where one segment of nuclear DNA matched to multiple sections of organelle DNA.
21292629:22	In our analyses, multiple organelle DNA hits to the same nuclear DNA regions were counted only once.
21292629:23	Because many of the nuclear genomes that we scanned are only in their draft assembly stage, the NUPT/NUMT data presented here should be treated as approximations of the true values.
21292629:24	As these genome sequences become more polished, the NUPT/NUMT estimates will change, but the major trends that we observed among the different groups should arguably remain the same.
21292629:25	Of the 30 species we investigated, 11 are polyplastidic and 19 are either monoplastidic or effectively so. Thirteen of the monoplastidic species are also monomitochondrial (i.e., they have one mitochondrion per cell).
21292629:26	The number of organelles per cell for each species and the references used to determine these statistics are listed in and ( online), respectively.
21292629:27	When possible, the decision to categorize a species as having one or multiple organelles per cell was based on published ultrastructural data.
21292629:28	Two caveats should be noted: The haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi and the stramenopile Thalassiosira pseudonana can have up to two plastids per cell but, for simplicity, were treated here as monoplastidic ( ; and references therein); and the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii and the moss Physcomitrella patens both contain cells that are polyplastidic, but for the purpose of this study, they were considered “effectively monoplastidic” because mitosis and meiosis only occur in cells that contain a single plastid.
21292629:29	Polyplastidy Means More NUPTs 
Complete NUPT and, when attainable, NUMT statistics for the various plastid-bearing species that we investigated are shown in . Overall, we found the difference in NUPT content between mono- and polyplastidic species to be highly significant.
21292629:30	Species with multiple plastids per cell had on average 80 times more NUPTs than those with one plastid per cell.
21292629:31	The mean NUPT content for polyplastidic species was 460 kb as compared with only 6 kb for monoplastidic taxa.
21292629:32	Moreover, the average number of NUPTs (based on Blast hits, not accumulative length) for polyplastidic individuals was 20 times greater than that of monoplastidic species (1,540 vs. 79 hits).
21292629:33	In species with only a single plastid, the NUPT content ranged from undetectable levels in the protists Aureococcus anophagefferens Babesia bovis Ostreococcus sp.
21292629:34	RCC809, and Theileria parva to ∼65 kb for the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri whereas in polyplastidic species, it spanned from 50 kb for Arabidopsis thaliana to >800 kb for Glycine max Vitis vinifera and Oryza sativa . There is a clear separation in NUPT content between mono- and polyplastidic species, with the members of the latter group having considerably more NUPTs than the former ( and ).
21292629:35	The only exceptions were V. carteri and A.
21292629:36	thaliana; the reasons for this may be linked to their capacity (or deficiency) for purging bulk nuclear DNA (discussed further below).
21292629:37	It is also noteworthy that of the 13 land plants that were explored the 2 that are effectively monoplastidic ( S. moellendorffii and P. patens ) had about 60 times fewer NUPTs than those that are polyplastidic ( and ).
21292629:38	Our NUMT analyses revealed similar trends and conclusions as those described above for NUPTs.
21292629:39	Species with only a single mitochondrion per cell had significantly fewer NUMTs than those with many mitochondria per cell ( and ).
21292629:40	The average NUMT content for monomitochondrial species (1.1 kb) was ∼300 times less than that of polymitochondrial taxa (380 kb).
21292629:41	These data are consistent with earlier observations on NUMTs and support the belief that organelle number influences both NUPT and NUMT content.
21292629:42	Larger Genomes, Larger NUPT Content 
It was recently shown that NUMT content scales positively with nuclear genome size.
21292629:43	Here, we found that this is true for NUPTs as well: Bloated nuclear genomes tend to have more NUPTs than those that are compact—based on the 30 species investigated here, we found a reasonably strong relationship between nuclear genome size and NUPT content ( R 2 = 0.57, P = 8.6 × 10 −7).
21292629:44	We expected to find this relationship because NUPTs are a type of excess DNA, and it is well established that all types of excess DNA mutually expand as the number of nucleotides in a genome increases.
21292629:45	Ultimately, this suggests that the forces governing the expansion and contraction of noncoding nuclear DNA impact the accumulative length of NUPTs in a nuclear genome.
21292629:46	Although the nature of these forces is hotly debated, there is evidence that the tendency for excess DNA to accumulate depends on the combined effects of the mutation rate (μ) and the effective genetic population size ( N e; ).
21292629:47	According to this hypothesis, one may expect species with a low N eμ to have more NUPTs than those with a high N eμ.
21292629:48	Although there are very few reliable data on this fundamental population genetic parameter, a recent study indicates that V. carteri has a very small N eμ, especially relative to other protists.
21292629:49	This could help explain why of all the monoplastidic species that we studied, V. carteri had the largest NUPT content.
21292629:50	Being monoplastidic, one would expect the transfer of ptDNA to the nuclear genome to be rare in V. carteri but having a low N eμ implies that it has a reduced ability to detect and eradicate excess DNA so that the few NUPTs that do arise avoid deletion and therefore can accumulate to reasonably high levels over time.
21292629:51	Interestingly, the N eμ estimates for the nuclear DNA of Arabidopsis spp.
21292629:52	are about three times those of V. carteri; thus, one explanation for why A.
21292629:53	thaliana which is polyplastidic, had fewer NUPTs than the monoplastidic V. carteri could be that it is reasonably efficient at perceiving and purging noncoding nuclear DNA.
21292629:54	It is worth mentioning that the V. carteri ptDNA, at ∼525 kb, is the largest plastid genome sequenced to date, being >300 kb larger than any other ptDNA employed in our data set.
21292629:55	And although we did not find an association between plastid genome size and NUPT content ( online), there is still the possibility that the prodigious ptDNA of V. carteri is in some way contributing to its elevated NUPT content.
21292629:56	The Evolution of NUPTs: It Is a Give and Take Relationship 
The data presented here provide support for the limited transfer window hypothesis and the notion that the number of plastids per cell in a eukaryotic species governs the amount of NUPTs found in its nuclear genome.
21292629:57	We argue that the evolution of NUPTs is a “give and take” process where plastid number determines the potential for ptDNA to be donated (i.e., given) to the nuclear genome, and the probability that these ptDNA sequences will be accepted (i.e., taken) by the nuclear genome and persist as nuclear DNA is determined by a species’ ability (or lack thereof) to detect and eliminate excess DNA.
21292629:58	In this study, being monoplastidic versus polyplastidic was used to define the number of plastids per cell in a species, and nuclear genome size was used as of a proxy for defining a species, ability to eradicate noncoding nuclear DNA.
21292629:59	This same argument applies to NUMTs as well.
21292629:60	Again, it must be stressed that many of the nuclear DNA sequences that we used to calculate NUPT/NUMT abundance were in their draft assembly stage.
21292629:61	As these genome assemblies improve, their NUPT/NUMT statistics may change, but we believe that the major trends reported here will be borne out by future investigations.
21292629:62	Finally, given the wide diversity of eukaryotic species that we explored, there are certainly factors in addition to a limited transfer window and susceptibility to bulk DNA that are influencing NUPT and NUMT content; however, we argue these additional factors (whatever they may be) will turn out to be secondary to the forces outlined here.
21292629:63	Materials and Methods 
The sources and references for the nuclear genome sequences employed in this study, as well the GenBank accession numbers, when available, are shown in ( online).
21292629:64	All nuclear DNA data came from publicly available sources.
21292629:65	The organelle DNA sequences (including their lengths, GenBank accession numbers, and noncoding DNA contents) used as queries for BlastN searches against nuclear genomes are listed in ( online).
21292629:66	Some of the organelle DNA sequences that were used in this study are not deposited in GenBank but are available for download online from the given genome project Web site ( online).
21292629:67	Nuclear genomes were scanned for NUPTs and NUMTs with BlastN (version 2.2.23) using the following parameters: an expectation value of 0.0001; a word size of 11; match and mismatch scores of 2 and −3, respectively; and gap-cost values of 5 (existence) and 2 (extension).
21292629:68	Hits under 30 nt and showing <70% sequence identity to the query were ignored.
21292629:69	Spurious hits, such as those where organelle genes matched to homologous genes in the nuclear genome (e.g., organelle ribosomal DNA [rDNA] matching to nuclear rDNA) were ignored.
21292629:70	Instances where one segment of nuclear DNA matched to multiple sections of organelle DNA (i.e., duplicate Blast hits) were reduced to a single Blast hit; in other words, NUPTs and NUMTs matching to multiple organelle genomic regions, such as repetitive elements, were counted only once.
21292629:71	Regions of nuclear DNA that contained tight clusters of NUPTs or NUMTs (i.e., sections of organelle-like DNA interrupted by genomic sequence that did not show sequence identity to organelle DNA) were not counted as a single NUPT or NUMT but as separate hits.
21292629:72	Data and sources used to calculate the number of organelles per cell are shown in ( online).

20043242:0	Introduction 
Due to differences in culture, healthcare systems, ethnicity , socioeconomic status  and disease prevalence , existing guidelines for cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) developed by western professional societies are often not applicable in Asian countries.
20043242:1	In March 2009, the Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging (ASCI), as the only society in Asia dedicated solely to cardiovascular imaging, nominated 7 representatives from different Asian countries to form a working group to provide recommendations on cardiac CT and cardiac MR.
20043242:2	Detailed background of this project has previously been described in the ASCI cardiac CT criteria report, the first publication from the working group, which summarized the opinions of leading cardiac CT practitioners in Asia on 51 indications . As the second step, we present here the ASCI cardiac MR appropriateness criteria.
20043242:3	The purpose of this report is to serve as a reference for Asian practitioners to promote and improve their use of cardiac MR by providing appropriateness ratings for common clinical indications.
20043242:4	Methods 
ASCI cardiac MR appropriateness criteria were developed through the same process as used for ASCI CT appropriateness criteria published earlier this year . Briefly, we employed the modified Delphi method with one-round data collection to evaluate the cardiac MR appropriateness . A total of 25 panelists were nominated [Japan 6, Korea 5, Taiwan 4, China 3, Hong Kong (China) 3, Singapore 2, Thailand 2] by Working Group members, and approved by the Working Group with consensus.
20043242:5	In the development of the cardiac MR indications, the Working Group members agreed to use the 33 cardiac MR indications provided by the ACCF 2006 appropriateness criteria as the framework . Indications considered for the ASCI 2010 cardiac CT appropriateness criteria were added and integrated to derive 50 indications which were approved by the Working Group.
20043242:6	Among the 50 indications, 28 were in common with ACCF 2006 appropriateness criteria and 39 were in common with ASCI 2010 CT appropriateness criteria.
20043242:7	Three indications [risk assessment in general populations with low, moderate and high coronary heart disease risk using coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)] were original indications of ASCI cardiac MR appropriateness criteria.
20043242:8	A questionnaire was emailed to the 25 Technical Panel members.
20043242:9	After completion, the questionnaires were collected by the ASCI office.
20043242:10	The questionnaires were collected during a period between October 13 and November 11, 2009.
20043242:11	Please refer to the online supplement for the complete questionnaire (Online Supplement 1).
20043242:12	Results 
The questionnaires were emailed to the Technical Panel members on October 13, 2009.
20043242:13	Completed questionnaires were returned from 23 members [Japan 6, Korea 5, Taiwan 4, China 2, Hong Kong (China) 2, Singapore 2, Thailand 2] by November 11.
20043242:14	Their specialties were radiology in 17 and cardiology in 6.
20043242:15	The years of experience in the cardiovascular field ranged from 4 to 26 years while the experience of cardiac MR interpretation ranged from 300 to 3,000 examinations.
20043242:16	For the cardiologists, the number of percutaneous coronary interventions performed range from 0 to 700 cases.
20043242:17	The hospitals they were working in included city hospitals, medical centers, and university hospitals, with in-patient bed numbers ranging from 440 to 5,600.
20043242:18	The complete list of Technical Panel members is provided at the beginning of this report.
20043242:19	Among the indications rated by Technical Panel, none showed disagreement.
20043242:20	There were 24 appropriate, 18 uncertain and 8 inappropriate indications.
20043242:21	Technical Panel members highly agreed in 22 indications, including 19 appropriate and 3 inappropriate indications.
20043242:22	The ‘highly agreed’ inappropriate indications were: use of cardiac MR for evaluation of chest pain syndrome in patients with low pre-test probabilities of CAD, interpretable ECGs and ability to exercise; use of cardiac MR for detection of CAD in asymptomatic patients with low coronary heart disease risk; and use of coronary MRA for risk assessment in patients with low coronary heart disease risk.
20043242:23	A detail appropriateness rating result is provided as an online supplement (Online Supplement 2).
20043242:24	Compared with the ACCF 2006 report , only 4/28 (14%) indications changed their category.
20043242:25	Indication no.
20043242:26	38 (“evaluation of LV function following myocardial infarction or in heart failure patients”) and no.
20043242:27	49 (“to detect post PCI myocardial necrosis”) were shifted from uncertain to appropriate.
20043242:28	Indication no. 30 (“evaluation of bypass grafts and coronary anatomy”) and no.
20043242:29	31 (“history of percutaneous revascularization with stents”) were shifted from inappropriate to uncertain.
20043242:30	Compared with the ASCI cardiac CT appropriateness criteria report , 29/39 (74%) were in the same appropriateness category.
20043242:31	In 7 indications, cardiac CT received a more favorable category than cardiac MR: indication no. 2 (“detection of CAD: symptomatic, intermediate pre-test probability of CAD.
20043242:32	ECG interpretable and able to exercise”), no.
20043242:33	27 (“use of MRI for CAD evaluation before valve surgery”), no.
20043242:34	29 (“evaluation of complex lesions before PCI”), no. 30 (“evaluation of bypass grafts and coronary anatomy”), no.
20043242:35	31 (“history of percutaneous revascularization with stents”), no.
20043242:36	33 (“evaluation of bypass grafts and coronary anatomy greater than or equal to 5 years after CABG”), and no.
20043242:37	34 (“evaluation for in-stent restenosis and coronary anatomy after PCI”).
20043242:38	On the other hand, cardiac MR received a more favorable category than cardiac CT in 3 indications; indication no.
20043242:39	38 (“evaluation of LV function following myocardial infarction or in heart failure patients”), no.
20043242:40	48 (“to determine the location and extent of myocardial infarction including ‘no-reflow’ regions, post-acute myocardial infarction”), and no.
20043242:41	50 (“to determine viability prior to revascularization”).
20043242:42	The final ratings for cardiac MR are listed by indication sequentially (Tables  , , , , , ) and by appropriateness category (Tables  , ).
20043242:43	Discussion 
This ASCI cardiac MR appropriateness criteria report was developed in order to reflect the current status of cardiac MR in Asia and the opinions of Asian cardiac MR leaders about appropriate indications for cardiac MR.
20043242:44	This report should prove useful in clinical practice in Asia, especially for institutes starting cardiac MR services for the first time.
20043242:45	Among the 50 indications evaluated in this report, 28 were in common with the ACCF 2006 appropriateness criteria report , 39 were also included in the ASCI 2010 cardiac CT appropriateness criteria report  and 3 indications were unique to this report.
20043242:46	In contrast to the ASCI cardiac CT appropriateness criteria report in which an upward shift of appropriateness category was demonstrated in 51.3% (20/39) of the indications as compared with ACCF 2006 appropriateness criteria report, such a shift was seen in only 14.3% (4/28) of the indications in this cardiac MR appropriateness criteria report.
20043242:47	The rapid advancement of CT technology  and associated accumulation of evidence of its clinical usefulness   as well as reduction of its radiation levels  may explain the faster expansion of appropriate indications for cardiac CT compared to the expansion seen for cardiac MR, which has seen comparatively few technical advances over the past 5 years.
20043242:48	One of the most significant features of the ASCI cardiac CT and cardiac MR appropriateness criteria reports is the high number of indications evaluated for both CT and MR.
20043242:49	Although cardiac CT was originally developed for visualization of coronary anatomy, recent studies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of one-stop shop cardiac examination in assessment of function, myocardial ischemia and myocardial viability . Meanwhile, the introduction of whole heart coronary MRA has enabled routine imaging of coronary anatomy which is completely noninvasive and without the need for radiation exposure and contrast medium [ , ].
20043242:50	Given the similarities in information obtainable, it is inevitable that CT and MR share many indications.
20043242:51	In our questionnaire surveys, different panelists were selected for CT and MR.
20043242:52	The panelists were not aware that similar surveys were being performed for the other modality, thus minimizing the extent to which their ratings were based on comparison to the other modality.
20043242:53	Our survey demonstrated that CT received higher ratings than MR in the morphological assessment of native coronary arteries and bypass grafts before and after revascularization therapy.
20043242:54	On the other hand, assessment of myocardial viability and fibrosis can be performed better with MR.
20043242:55	However, most appropriateness ratings were similar for CT and MR, indicating that modality choice should be based on the technology and expertise available at each individual medical center.
20043242:56	“Use of coronary MRA in the risk assessment of general population” was evaluated in this survey.
20043242:57	This indication was evaluated because coronary MRA has been gaining popularity as a screening tool in recent years, since the introduction of whole-heart coronary MRA . We found that experts in Asia consider this indication inappropriate in populations with low to intermediate coronary heart disease risk.
20043242:58	Future research is needed to determine whether risk assessment of population with high coronary heart disease risk is appropriate or not.
20043242:59	This survey had several limitations.
20043242:60	As was the case with the ASCI cardiac CT appropriateness criteria report, the Technical Panel in this study was dominated by experts from Eastern and Southeastern Asia reflecting the current academic contribution and participation in ASCI.
20043242:61	We hope to see active participation in ASCI from Asian countries outside the Asia–Pacific region in the future.
20043242:62	Secondly, many Technical Panelists proposed further clarification of the scan protocol.
20043242:63	Although the importance of correct choice of MR scan protocol cannot be underestimated, this aspect is considered too complicated to be included in this questionnaire survey because of the diversity and rapid innovation of MR scan techniques used for cardiac examinations.
20043242:64	Third, the comparison of CT and MR in the discussion section was done based on separate surveys.
20043242:65	Since the panelists were not aware of the potential comparison, the comparison is not a ‘head-to-head’ comparison.
20043242:66	Rather, the comparison is actually ‘what indications cardiac CT experts think are appropriate for cardiac CT’ vs ‘what indications cardiac MR experts think are appropriate for cardiac MR’.
20043242:67	Although such comparison still gives us some reasonable insights on the appropriate choice of modality, ‘head-to-head’ comparison might be more desirable for appropriate use of cardiac CT and cardiac MR.
20043242:68	However, in order to perform a ‘head-to-head’ comparison, we would need to subdivide the indications based on the patient’s age, sex, renal function, allergy to the contrast medium etc., which would run the risk of making the guidelines overly lengthy and complicated.
20043242:69	We expect that this ASCI 2010 cardiac MR appropriateness criteria report will serve as a timely and useful guide for the establishment of clinical cardiac MR services in Asian countries.
20043242:70	ASCI will continue to pay close attention to this field and keep Asian practitioners updated about developments in cardiac MR and new indications as they arise.
17376804:0	INTRODUCTION 
The application of Cre/ loxP recombination has refined the tools for manipulating the mouse genome, allowing to determine site and timing of gene alteration in the living animal.
17376804:1	An inherent feature of these recombinase-based approaches, however, is a non-reversible gene switch that does not allow modulating gene expression in a given cell.
17376804:2	In addition, the derivation of conditional mouse mutants is costly and time consuming due to extensive vector construction, ES cell manipulation and breeding.
17376804:3	The finding that stably expressed short hairpin (sh) RNAs can mediate potent gene knockdown in transgenic animals opened the opportunity to reduce time and effort for the generation of genetically modified mouse models significantly.
17376804:4	Conditional, RNAi-mediated gene knockdown in mice has been introduced by using Cre/ loxP for tissue-specific control of shRNA expression.
17376804:5	In contrast, temporal control of shRNA expression in transgenic animals has not been demonstrated so far.
17376804:6	Type 2 Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem to public health, affecting more than 5% of western populations.
17376804:7	Progressive, late onset insulin resistance and inadequate compensation through insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells leading to fasting hyperglycemia characterizes the course of the disease.
17376804:8	Efforts of the pharmaceutical industry focus on the development of small molecules that increase the sensitivity of insulin receptor signaling.
17376804:9	Here, animal models of insulin resistance are essential tools for understanding the molecular basis of the disease.
17376804:10	Furthermore, drug target validation and evaluation of test compounds in appropriate disease model mice support the drug discovery process.
17376804:11	The use of current genetic mouse models of type 2 diabetes is not optimal for this purpose as they do not allow modulating the onset and the degree of systemic insulin resistance, and the genetic modifications are not reversible.
17376804:12	The first aspect is particularly important for developing therapeutic interventions during the early phase of the disease, whereas the latter would allow dissecting acute effects of insulin resistance from late diabetic symptoms such as neuropathy and arteriosclerosis.
17376804:13	As the current technologies for gene manipulation do not facilitate these aspects, we established a new approach for temporal modulation of gene expression in vivo . 
In cultured cell lines, inducible expression of antisense or shRNAs has been achieved by using engineered, RNA polymerase III-dependent promoters containing operator sequences (tetO) of the E. coli tetracycline resistance operon.
17376804:14	Binding of the tetracycline resistance operon repressor (tetR) to tetO blocks transcription, whereas de-repression is achievable by adding the inductor doxycycline (dox), causing release of TetR.
17376804:15	Here we show that a codon optimized tet repressor, but not the wt coding region as employed in previous attempts, facilitates tight control of RNAi in different cell types and throughout development of transgenic mice.
17376804:16	We found efficient, doxycycline-inducible silencing of both, a luciferase reporter and the insulin receptor gene, reaching 80–90% repression in most tissues.
17376804:17	By introducing single-vector-constructs into the ES cell genome via recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and applying tetraploid blastocyst complementation we demonstrate the rapid generation of a reversible mouse model of type 2 Diabetes mellitus within 3 months.
17376804:18	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
In this work, we describe a straightforward method for the generation of drug-inducible knockdown mouse models.
17376804:19	Several key issues for the state-of-the-art development of transgenic mice are addressed: (i) Reproducible transgene expression is warranted by the well-characterized rosa26 locus.
17376804:20	(ii) High targeting efficiency of transgene constructs into the rosa26 locus is achieved by exploiting recombinase-mediated cassette exchange.
17376804:21	(iii) Minimization of elaborated genetic modifications is allowed by a one-, rather than a multi-vector expression cassette.
17376804:22	(iv) Tight and reversible regulation of shRNA expression is obtained by the usage of a codon-optimized tet-repressor.
17376804:23	(v) Rapid generation of mice without further breeding is achieved by tetraploid embryo complementation.
17376804:24	The type 2 diabetes mouse model described in this article illustrates the capability of this technology.
17376804:25	The model for insulin resistance presented herein, exhibits several advantages over existing ones.
17376804:26	First of all, induction of insulin resistance allows to circumvent potential confounding developmental effects or compensatory mechanisms altering the phenotype.
17376804:27	Moreover, the temporal control of insulin receptor knockdown can provide further insights into the impact of environmental factors prior to the onset of the disease.
17376804:28	Second, reversibility of hyperglycemia provides a unique model to mimic the effect of an ideal pharmacological intervention.
17376804:29	Along this line, it has so far not been established to what extent perfect control of metabolism after onset of disease is successful to prevent occurrence and/or progression of diabetic complications or lead even to reversion of them.
17376804:30	Therefore, this model will be of central importance to gain better insights into not only diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, polyneuropathy, but also macrovascular complications such as myocardial infection and stroke.
17376804:31	Third, the obvious doxycycline-dependent reduction of insulin repressor expression can be extended to carefully determine the critical threshold of insulin action necessary to (i) induce a compensatory increase in pancreatic β-cell secretion and (ii) the occurrence of hyperglycemia.
17376804:32	Thereby, these experiments will help to define the therapeutic efficiency required for reversal of clinically relevant insulin resistance.
17376804:33	Finally, the single-allele configuration of the transgene circumvents time- and cost-consuming crossing experiments and makes it an ideal model for genetic screens for insulin resistance modulations, i.e. in a sensitized ENU-screen.
17376804:34	Previous examples of doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression were restricted to in vitro applications or gene knockdown in tumor cells transplanted into nude mice.
17376804:35	The activity of such systems in selected cell clones are not predictive for in vivo applications in which a tight control of RNAi needs to be achieved in different cell types and throughout development.
17376804:36	In addition, these approaches included random transgenesis or lentiviral infection, each resulting in clones with unique, irreproducible shRNA expression patterns.
17376804:37	Screening of several cell lines was required, which is laborious and time consuming.
17376804:38	Therefore, these techniques, albeit being useful for the particular experiment presented, are not generally applicable for different biological questions.
17376804:39	Here, we show that a codon optimized rather than the wild-type tetR mediates tight control of the H1-tet promoter when integrated at the rosa26 locus.
17376804:40	ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown is achieved within 10 days of doxycycline treatment.
17376804:41	The system appeared to be reversible within 14 days after withdrawal of the inductor.
17376804:42	This is in accordance with previous observations that saturation of a system with doxycycline is an intrinsically faster process than depletion.
17376804:43	The kinetics of reversible gene modulation may be further improvable by applying other tetracycline derivates with a shorter half-life in vivo .
17376804:44	The targeted insertion of all elements required for inducible shRNA expression into rosa26 using RMCE, and the subsequent ES cell injection using tetraploid blastocysts accelerate the generation of conditional knockdown mice significantly: 2 weeks for cloning of the RMCE exchange vector, 3 weeks for generating targeted ES cell clones, 4 weeks for the generation of newborn mice.
17376804:45	Therefore, our system facilitates a rapid performance of in vivo gene function studies, providing a generally applicable tool for reverse mouse genetics research.
17376804:46	Moreover, it permits the investigation of the effect of gene knockdown after the onset of a chronic or acute disease.
17376804:47	This aspect is of particular interest for pharmaceutical drug target validation, as inducible gene silencing in mouse models of human disease can provide an ideal surrogate for the treatment of patients with antagonistic drugs.
17376804:48	Even multiple dose regimes can be tested in preclinical studies by applying several rounds of induction.
17376804:49	Furthermore, reversible knockdown of drug targets can help to distinguish target dependent from target independent effects of drug action.
17376804:50	Taken together, the technology described provides a novel, rapidly applicable approach for the inducible and reversible analysis of gene function in mice, overcoming the limitations of recombinase-based conditional gene targeting.

18728785:0	Introduction 
About 30 years ago a revolutionary technique was introduced which allowed stimulation of the human brain through the skull with non-invasive, high-intensity, extremely brief electric pulses – followed –few years later- by a new device that employs strong and brief, time-varying magnetic fields able to induce electric currents flowing within the brain without any discomfort ; for a review see .
18728785:1	Since then, focal types of stimulating coils able to activate relatively small cortical areas allowing cortical mapping were developed . Therefore, focal TMS to different cells of a grid overlying the primary motor cortex (M1) while recording electromyographic (EMG) responses from the contralateral ‘target’ muscles, made it possible to obtain reliable maps of cortical motor output in awake and cooperative subjects – . Due to technical limitations (i.e. number of recording amplifiers) and to the burden of post-hoc analysis, all the reports regard one (the vast majority) to a maximum of 4 upper limb individual muscles simultaneously analysed , ; in this way a roughly “somatotopic gradient” similar to penfieldian organization -in which wide overlapping was observed- was consistently reported.
18728785:2	Different studies demonstrated both in primates and in humans that several loci along the pre-central motor strip contain separate representations of the same muscle (convergence).
18728785:3	Meanwhile, it was shown that the same cortical site when focally stimulated can dispatch outgoing impulses to different muscles (divergence) and that muscles acting at different upper limb joints are represented at different cortical foci where they act in concert with different companion muscles.
18728785:4	It has been shown that such parameters are highly influenced by limb posture – . Convergence, divergence, multiple muscle cortical representations and the influence of posture seem to play a pivotal role also in humans, orchestrating several muscles ‘in concert’ during motor actions, motor learning and post-lesional ‘plastic’ brain reorganization – . Even if invasive stimulation/recording procedures allowing a direct evaluation of these phenomena cannot be used in humans, TMS offers a valuable probe for a better knowledge of the dynamics of the cortical topography of individual muscles when they are treated as an ensemble and not as individual actors.
18728785:5	The aim of the present study was to investigate overlap and covariation of cortical motor output during TMS mapping, and simultaneous recordings from 12 individual upper limb muscles in order to measure cortical overlapping and covariation of pairs of muscles, interhemispheric differences and influence of arm/hand posture.
18728785:6	Two measures were chosen to indicate overlap and covariation: 1) cortical overlapping of each pair of muscles, defined as the percentage of grid positions where TMS elicited a MEP response in both muscles respect to the total number of grid positions where TMS elicited a MEP response in at least one of the two, and 2) covariation of each pair of muscles, measured by means of Pearson's correlation.
18728785:7	These measures make it possible to disentangle two neurophysiological aspects of functional connectivity: first, overlapping is related to the co-activation of the target muscles and indicates how much pairs of muscles are simultaneously represented in the motor cortex; second the covariation could be an index of the intensity and the direction of the co-activation.
18728785:8	Results 
The experimental setting and electrode positioning for simultaneous MEP recordings from the examined muscles is represented in while traces of the original MEPs obtained from 12 muscles of subject 2 are shown in . 
Discussion 
Modern concepts on the functional organization of cortical primary motor areas maintain a somatotopic view only for major body districts (such as face, arm, leg), each being sustained by a network serving broadly distributed functions which involve large populations of neurons in spatially separate clusters.
18728785:9	Within this theoretical frame, the main goal of the present study was to investigate whether the use of a non-invasive technique like TMS could roughly disentangle the representational overlapping between different upper limb muscles and the eventual functional correlation in humans.
18728785:10	– . 
The existence of multiple yet discrete efferent micro- and macrozones from primary motor cortex, is now accepted as the essential organizational principle of this area.
18728785:11	Animal studies have in fact demonstrated that a particular movement can be elicited through stimulation of different M1 regions, often several millimeters apart and separated by non-responsive districts – – . In addition, bi-directional projections interconnect motor cortex areas for different muscle districts for a review.
18728785:12	Any movement therefore, differently from the traditional view of the labelled-line hypothesis, is probably not controlled by single aggregates, but by a distributed network within the M1 cortex.
18728785:13	In this model, the motor output from overlapping cortical territories converge onto individual muscles.
18728785:14	Similarly, the output from any given cortical site diverges onto multiple muscles with different ‘gain’ according to the final movement to be performed, presumably regulated by horizontal intracortical projections interconnecting functionally related neuronal clusters within M1 , . 
Multiple representations of the cortical output to individual muscles, overlap each other.
18728785:15	Multiple cortical representation of muscles controlling hand/fingers, represents the functional frame for the extraordinary repertoire of movement strategies (i.e. concerted actions orchestrated by many –sometimes the same- muscles acting on different joints at different times , ).
18728785:16	Such an organization also provides flexibility in motor planning and execution, and progressively substitutes a related dysfunctional area more easily than highly specialized and unique groups of cells, being thus fundamental either for restorative or for maladaptive plasticity.
18728785:17	Precise methods such as those in experimental models, allowing microneurographic stimulation/recording procedures from individual neurons/fibers in the motor cortex, pyramidal tract and spinal motoneurons cannot be used in humans to address physiological mechanisms for movement control like convergence, divergence and multiple muscle representation.
18728785:18	Several techniques for functional brain imaging –namely PET and fMRI- allow detailed images on the relationship between function and anatomy showing the distributed network subtending a given motor act.
18728785:19	However they cannot discriminate the temporal dynamics of a phenomenon taking place in few tens of milliseconds or differentiate neuronal firing decrease from increase (exciting vs inhibiting net effects); moreover, in the case of movement paradigms, the activation directly linked to motor programming and execution cannot be distinguished from the sensory input feed-back from the moving parts, and the chronological hierarchy –if any- governing activated areas cannot be studied appropriately . Despite their potential ability to properly follow-up such a brain mechanism, non-invasive brain stimulation procedures have never been tested along this vein in human beings, despite their progressively growing use in research for movement physiology and pathophysiology see for a review.
18728785:20	In fact, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex has largely been employed in investigating neurophysiological mechanisms of motor control in the healthy subjects , , – and in patients with neurological motor deficits , – . Mapping procedures of motor cortical output have been progressively implemented and integrated with precise anatomical brain reconstructions , – .
18728785:21	However, no previous studies investigated in detail the functional linkage amongst upper limb muscles simultaneously recorded during TMS mapping of output from M1 cortex.
18728785:22	We document significant overlapping between proximal and distal muscles, in line with many animal studies involving the superposition of topographical maps of the motor cortex obtained by microstimulation and morphological connectivity maps obtained by tracer injections.
18728785:23	The concordance between such studies and our TMS findings (related to trans-synaptic activation) could also be referred to the existence of intrinsic horizontal collaterals (intracortical connections) . 
Findings from the present study demonstrate significant difference between the 66 pairs of muscles in terms of cortical overlapping: this index reached high scores for hand-forearm muscles and low for arm vs hand/forearm muscles.
18728785:24	Moreover, a subset of low-overlapping muscles characterised by a low percentage of overlap was clearly identified by all pairs with at least one of the three arm muscles.
18728785:25	In a separate cluster, there is a group of pairs with high-overlapping muscles which include almost all hand-hand, hand-forearm and forearm-forearm possible pairs.
18728785:26	When covariation was taken into consideration interesting observations emerged.
18728785:27	In particular, our data were obtained at rest and there was a lack of covariation between forearm/hand and more proximal arm muscles.
18728785:28	Our covariation measure gives an evidence of the motor cortex representation of “muscle synergies” (in terms of the directionality of a coactivation) that should not be considered hard-wired entities.
18728785:29	In fact, in the modern view of an integrated nature of motor cortical function, movement-related muscle synergies “may be dynamically created by the operations of motor cortical circuitry” – .
18728785:30	Moreover, high covariations for wrist extensors and hand muscles were seen up to the most correlated pair EUC-OPP.
18728785:31	One might argue that this functional organization of M1 output is strongly devoted to the control of wrist joint.
18728785:32	When right and left hemispheres were compared, a significant Hemisphere effect was found indicating that the index of overlapping in the left was significantly higher than in the right hemisphere.
18728785:33	Even if this observation is intriguing, whether it has some relationship with manual dexterity and hemispheric dominance for hand motor preference, needs further evaluation in a population with right vs left-hand dexterity.
18728785:34	It is worth noting that a larger overlapping in the left hemisphere, without a corresponding inter-hemispheric difference of the single muscle cortical representation was found.
18728785:35	This larger overlapping in the left hemisphere could be related to its lifetime higher training of all twelve studied muscles with respect to the right hemisphere, resulting in a larger connectivity within M1 cortex.
18728785:36	Interhemispheric difference was not observed when the covariation measure was analysed.
18728785:37	Covariation could be interpreted as an index of the intensity and direction of the co-activation; therefore, the larger overlapping observed in the left hemisphere did not involve a higher co-variation.
18728785:38	Of course, covariation/overlapping measures are significantly correlated (r = 0.49),
18728785:39	indicating that about 25% of the variance of one could be accounted for by the other.
18728785:40	In fact, to calculate the covariation the two muscles have to be simultaneously represented in the motor cortex (that is to say, there must be coactivation/overlapping of the two muscles).
18728785:41	So we can affirm that overlapping is the basic phenomenon on which the covariation takes place, but also that covariation could be considered as an index of the intensity and direction of the co-activation.
18728785:42	In other words, co-activation and covariation could be summarised only partially by one of them.
18728785:43	The contamination between these two measures, although present, is not sufficient to conclude that they indicated the same phenomenon.
18728785:44	In addition, the similarity of patterns represented in the two panels of is only apparent, since co-activation was higher in right than in left hemisphere (left panel), while covariation was not different in the two hemispheres.
18728785:45	For these reasons (the first neurophysiological, the second statistical) the two measures can reflect two different neurophysiological aspects of functional connectivity.
18728785:46	Network structure can adjust dynamically to meet the immediate needs of the motor system, as seen in response to postural changes ; indeed, in the present study hand position significantly influenced both overlapping and covariation indexes.
18728785:47	The larger overlapping with prone hand seemed to be specific to pairs of muscles belonging to hand and forearm, while no changes occurred for proximal muscles.
18728785:48	Therefore, this effect seemed specific to the muscles and districts where the main change in proprioceptive input occurred, and can be linked to task-devoted organization of synaptic contacts at the periphery of cortical maps of the muscles involved.
18728785:49	Altogether, present findings with prone hand might be ascribed to cortical mechanisms facilitating coupling of muscle pairs for object' grasping and lifting -which needs involvement of more proximal muscles for joint stabilization and increased upper limb stiffness- compared to supine hand, facilitating a motor action most apt for object catching on a vertical axis, with less proximal muscle involvement . 
The potential effect of different peripheral nerve territories involvement on association measures was also examined, but neither overlapping nor covariation indexes were statistically linked to muscle pairs innervated by branches belonging to the same nerve trunk respect to the pairs controlled by different nerves.
18728785:50	This indicated that the observed patterns of muscle associations, take place within CNS, even if the present approach cannot discriminate between cortical and subcortical (including spinal) contributions.
18728785:51	In conclusion, simultaneous upper limb multiple-muscle recordings during mapping of M1 output with focal TMS has provided a bulk of information strongly related to the functionality of the arm/hand system in healthy humans.
18728785:52	This approach will hopefully permit better understanding of upper limb motor control in healthy subjects and in patients with motor disorders, by providing prognostic indexes for motor recovery and in following-up ‘plastic’ reorganization of the motor system after acute or progressive lesions.
18728785:53	Materials and Methods 
Mapping studies with TMS were performed on 10 healthy volunteers (6 females and 4 males), right handed, aged 28–40.
18728785:54	The experimental protocol had the approval of the ethics committee of Fatebenefratelli Hospital-Isola Tiberina (Rome) and all subjects gave written informed consent; international safety standards –including an EEG before subject were recruited for TMS- were strictly followed . 
Simultaneous EMG records were obtained from the following 12 muscles in different experimental conditions: Abductor Digiti Minimi (ADM), First Interosseus Dorsalis (FDI), Opponens Pollicis (OPP), Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB), Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC), Extensor Indicis Proprius (EIP), Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (EUC), Extensor Carpi Radialis (ERC), Flexor digitorum superficialis (communis) (FLC), Biceps brachii (BIC), Triceps (TRI), Deltoid (DEL).
18728785:55	During the experimental session the subject, wearing a transparent and well-fitting plastic cap, lay supine on a bed in order to facilitate complete relaxation and was kept alert by the investigator.
18728785:56	Six subjects attended for two testing procedures, one for each hemisphere, with arm, forearm and hand relaxed in prone position.
18728785:57	In three of them, another recording session was carried out only for right hemisphere with arm, forearm and hand relaxed in supine position.
18728785:58	This further recording was performed in order to assess eventual modifications induced on cortical somatotopy by arm/hand posture.
18728785:59	The remaining subjects only had one hemisphere and one hand position studied.
18728785:60	Focal single-pulse TMS was delivered to the scalp using a flat figure-of-eight coil with an inner diameter of 70 mm for each wing connected to a Magstim 200 magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company, Whitland, UK).
18728785:61	The coil was placed tangentially to the skull with the handle pointing backward and rotated away from the midline by 45°.
18728785:62	Stimulus intensity was adjusted at resting motor threshold defined on the hot spot following international guidelines as the stimulator's output able to elicit reproducible MEPs (at least 50 µV in amplitude) in about 50% of 10–20 consecutive stimuli in a completely relaxed Opponens Pollicis muscle . Once the excitability threshold was determined, TMS intensity was increased by 10% of the stimulator output to enhance response probability.
18728785:63	This intensity was an obvious compromise between the different excitability thresholds of the upper limb muscles and is usually able to elicit responses with a decreasing probability from hand to shoulder muscles (the latter having a higher threshold and stronger intensities requirement).
18728785:64	This was a forced choice in order to avoid an excessive “cortical spread” of the stimulus which would have occurred if we had utilized 110% intensity of the threshold of the less excitable (i.e. arm/shoulder) muscles.
18728785:65	The hot spot of the OPP, defined as the point from which stimuli triggered Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) of maximal amplitude and minimal latency, was found during a pilot stimulating/recording session with a frankly suprathreshold stimulus intensity.
18728785:66	The hot spot position was then marked on a transparent, adherent elastic cap to facilitate an exact re-positioning of the coil during the entire experiment.
18728785:67	In one paradigmatic subject 3D head/brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was obtained, coregistered with the grid of recording scalp electrodes as represented by vitamin E capsules.
18728785:68	Therefore, data presented in are realistic and not merely a graphical representation.
18728785:69	Using surface electrodes, EMG activity was recorded simultaneously from each of the 12 target muscles.
18728785:70	Skin was cleaned at the recording site followed by placement of Ag/AgCl cup electrodes filled with conductive gel in a belly/tendon montage.
18728785:71	Recording electrodes were placed over the bellies (active) and tendons (reference) of muscles to be monitored and ground a electrode was placed over the wrist.
18728785:72	Interelectrode distance was maintained as short as possible; this -together with the TMS intensity just above threshold- was deliberately chosen in order to reduce the amount of cross-talk from muscles different and adjacent from the one under examination.
18728785:73	Skin/electrode resistances were kept <10 KOhms.
18728785:74	Signal recording was carried out with a modified version of the BASIS-Brain Surveyor Equipment (EB-Neuro; 12 channels; sampling rate 5 KHz/channel, filtering bandpass 3–1500 Hz).
18728785:75	Subjects were wearing an elastic, transparent cap containing a grid of 121 numbered squares marked at 1 cm intervals, in which square 1 corresponded to the designated hot-spot of the OPP hand muscle used to define the excitability threshold.
18728785:76	The remaining squares were subsequently numbered in a spiral fashion.
18728785:77	The scalp vertex (the point on the midsagittal line, midway between nasion and inion) and the scalp anatomical landmarks (nasion, inion) were taped in a stable position on the cap.
18728785:78	Four consecutive MEPs were gathered from each grid position starting from square 1 and following the progressive numbering with a stimulus repetition rate of 0.1–0.2 c/sec.
18728785:79	The progression of stimulated sites of the scalp grid followed a spiral sequence, that could be considered a relatively safe method to avoid sequential stimulation of an ordered and topographically organized cortical representation of the muscles.
18728785:80	MEPs latency and amplitude were measured at peak onset and peak-to-peak of opposite polarity, respectively; they were calculated off-line for each stimulated site and for each muscle.
18728785:81	Particular care was devoted to maintain full relaxation of the examined muscles and trials contaminated by involuntary movement or muscle activity were discarded from further analysis.

20593038:1	Case report 
A 77-year-old Japanese woman had been hospitalized in our institute due to urocystitis.
20593038:2	In September 2007, she was incidentally diagnosed with a congenital extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm after Ultrasonography (US) was conducted during an investigation for lower abdominal fullness and residual urine.
20593038:3	She had undergone gastrectomy due to gastric ulcer without blood transfusion.
20593038:4	Her family history was not particularly interesting.
20593038:5	Physical examination revealed no jaundice, no abdominal mass, and no vascular noise.
20593038:6	Routine blood tests did not show any remarkable findings.
20593038:7	US revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic structure that was 26.4 × 21.7 
20593038:8	× 19.4 
20593038:9	mm in size at the porta hepatis (Figures , and ).
20593038:10	Color Doppler US demonstrated bidirectional color due to circular flow within the aneurysm.
20593038:11	Abdominal enhanced 3D-CT and CT angiography demonstrated that the saccular aneurysm at the hepatic hilum was 30 mm in diameter and was enhanced equal to that of portal vein (Figures , and ).
20593038:12	CT angiography demonstrated a common iliac artery aneurysm.
20593038:13	She remained asymptomatic and returned to the hospital 26 months after the diagnosis for follow-up.
20593038:14	The aneurysm showed no enlargement in size by follow-up CT and US after 27 months.
20593038:15	2.
20593038:16	Discussion 
Portal vein aneurysm (PVA) is an uncommon disease .
20593038:17	However, recently, the number of reported cases has gradually increased with advances in imaging techniques.
20593038:18	Koc et al.  reported 25 PVA cases in 4186 patients using abdominal CT and US.
20593038:19	PVAs are classified as intrahepatic and extrahepatic.
20593038:20	Our case was diagnosed as extrahepatic PVA.
20593038:21	Sixty-seven cases of extrahepatic PVAs were reported in the English literature from 1956 to 2008  . Including our case, we summarized 68 PVA cases.
20593038:22	Twenty-three males, 44 females, and one unknown were reported.
20593038:23	Their mean age was 51.4 years (range 0–83 years), and the mean size was 43.6 mm (range 8–115 mm).
20593038:24	The cyst-form was found in 36 cases and the fusiform was found in 22 cases (unknown 11 cases).
20593038:25	Half of all cases complained of abdominal or back pain.
20593038:26	Nineteen cases had no symptoms.
20593038:27	Twenty-one patients showed liver dysfunction in blood examination, and only 23 had portal hypertension.
20593038:28	Half of all cases had no past history.
20593038:29	Nineteen patients had undergone operation, 2 had undergone embolization by angiography, and 46 were observed clinically.
20593038:30	Fifty-eight cases had a good course, while 7 were dead.
20593038:31	Previously, most patients with asymptomatic PVAs were managed by observation . Recently, several reports have suggested that operation can be performed easily and safely . The operation may be one of the therapeuticprocedures for PVAs with any symptoms or complications.
20593038:32	The origin of PVAs may be congenital or acquired . Formerly, cases of PVA with liver disorder, portal hypertension, trauma, or pancreatitis were reported, but recently congenital PVA cases have been reported without these diseases, due to advances in imaging . Our case was considered to be congenital PVA due to the absence of past history and the presence of common iliac artery aneurysm.
20593038:33	Abdominal US (including Doppler US) is useful and convenient for the diagnosis of PVA and has been used in most cases to date [ , ].
20593038:34	About 70% of reported extra PVAs had undergone US.
20593038:35	By contrast, angiography can describe PVA collectively and clearly  but is not indispensable because of its invasive nature.
20593038:36	In place of angiography, MRI (including MR-angio) has been used increasingly . Our patient had undergone gastrectomy twenty years ago and stainless staples remained in the abdomen.
20593038:37	Because of those staples, 3D-CT was selected to describe a solid image of the whole portal vein system.
20593038:38	3D-CT can show the size and location of PVA in stereoimages.
20593038:39	Repeatability is high without interoperator variability and may confirm the diagnosis and the observation of PVA.
21042570:0	Introduction 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system.
21042570:1	Derangement of cellular immunity is central in the pathophysiology of MS.
21042570:2	MS is predominantly characterized by local T cell and macrophage infiltration and autoantibody production, leading to demyelination and loss of neurologic function.
21042570:3	MS is an autoimmune disease triggered by CD4+ T cells, mainly Th1.
21042570:4	More recently, Th17 cells have been shown to be involved in MS.
21042570:5	Antigens within the myelin sheath, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, have been described as the main targets of self-reactive CD4+ T cells and autoantibodies.
21042570:6	– 
T regulatory cells (Tregs), especially thymus-derived natural Tregs (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells), are of major importance in the maintenance of immune tolerance to self- and alloantigens.
21042570:7	Impairment of the inhibitory function of natural Tregs seems to play an important role in MS disease pathogenesis.
21042570:8	MS usually affects young adults aged 20–40 years, although it can begin earlier or later in life.
21042570:9	Women are affected almost twice as often as men.
21042570:10	The most common symptoms include sensory disturbances in the limbs, optic nerve dysfunction, pyramidal tract dysfunction, bladder or bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, ataxia, and diplopia.
21042570:11	The course of MS can follow four clinical patterns, ie, relapsing–remitting MS (RR-MS) accounting for 80%–90% of MS cases at onset, secondary progressive MS, primary progressive MS, and progressive relapsing MS.
21042570:12	Results from autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or stem cell transplantation applied to >400 MS patients between 1995 and 2008 showed improvement in more than 60% of the patients for at least three years post-transplantation, with a mortality risk of 2%–10%.
21042570:13	The accumulated experience from these trials helped clarify certain important points, ie, stem cell transplantation works better with early aggressive MS, whereas when this treatment is applied to patients with progressive MS and long disease duration, it has minor or moderate results, and intermediate-intensity pretransplant conditioning regimens work equally as well as toxic high-intensity regimens.
21042570:14	– 
Results from heterologous stem cell transplantation are very few (about five published cases).
21042570:15	In all these cases, stem cell transplantation was performed to treat a hematologic malignancy with concurrent MS.
21042570:16	MS improved in three of these patients, whereas in two patients it remained active.
21042570:17	Natalizumab is a new drug that is being used as monotherapy for relapsing forms of severe MS refractory to conventional treatments.
21042570:18	Natalizumab contains humanized neutralizing IgG4k monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte a4 integrins, which include a4β7 and a4β1, found on lymphocytes and monocytes.
21042570:19	By blocking a4 integrins, natalizumab blocks lymphocyte and monocyte trafficking to the sites of inflammation.
21042570:20	In this work we sought to determine changes in lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of an RR-MS patient refractory to conventional treatments and BMT who responded to natalizumab, with emphasis on the size and function of the patient’s Treg population.
21042570:21	The patient’s data are compared with data obtained from 11 RR-MS patients, under no treatment or treated with interferon (IFN)-β, and 20 healthy controls, in order to get a clear idea of the cell populations that can be considered as major players in the pathogenesis of this complex disease.

Results 
Discussion 
The immune system of patient A was being influenced by three independent variables, ie, the disease, BMT, and treatment with natalizumab.
21042570:23	Phenotypic analysis of patient A’s lymphocytes, seven years after BMT and before receiving natalizumab treatment, showed that most of the cell types studied were within or at the low end of the control RR-MS range, whereas his naive T helper and natural killer cell levels were very low.
21042570:24	Muraro et al showed that in seven patients with different types of MS (one with RR-MS) who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and did not relapse during a two-year follow-up, there were no significant differences from pretherapy in the proportions of CD3+ T cells, CD19+/CD20+ B cells, natural killer (CD3−CD56+) cells, natural killer T cells (CD3+ CD56+), and CD14+ monocytes.
21042570:25	The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly decreased due to the greater impact of therapy on CD4+ T cells during the first months, but reverted towards baseline at one year and reached pretherapy levels at two years.
21042570:26	They also showed a doubling of the frequency of naïve CD4+ T cells at the expense of memory T cells.
21042570:27	Natalizumab treatment of patient A resulted in lymphocytosis, reflecting the successful antagonism of a4 integrin.
21042570:28	Analysis of the lymphocyte populations of patient A revealed that lymphocytosis resulted mainly from increased levels of his CD20+ and CD20+CD5+ B cells, which may indicate an increase in the production of T cell-dependent and natural antibodies.
21042570:29	Linberg et al examined the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood cells of MS patients who had been treated with natalizumab for more than two years and compared them with placebo-treated patients.
21042570:30	They reported sustained altered transcription patterns of several genes expressed in lymphocytes, neutrophils, or erythrocytes, in particular those genes involved in B cell activation and differentiation.
21042570:31	Patient A’s effector T cell levels remained unchanged postnatalizumab treatment, with his naive T helper cells and natural killer cells remaining at extremely low levels throughout the study period.
21042570:32	Decreased levels of CD4+ T helper cells during natalizumab treatment have also been reported in earlier studies.
21042570:33	Finally, in patient A, natalizumab treatment resulted in a stable increase of his natural (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) Tregs.
21042570:34	Nevertheless, their numbers remained low compared with Tregs of healthy controls, ie, within the RR-MS control range.
21042570:35	In accordance with previous studies that have reported a lack of function of Tregs in MS, patient A’s Tregs before natalizumab treatment, when cultured with a strong myelin basic protein self-antigen, failed to respond and actually decreased in number, similar to Tregs from the RR-MS controls.
21042570:36	In contrast, postnatalizumab treatment, patient A’s Tregs responded well to the self-antigen, maintaining a stable increase of about 42%, ie, patient A acquired functional Tregs.
21042570:37	Taken together, the results suggest that BMT failed to generate new T cells, natural killer cells, and Tregs in patient A, and this is probably the reason why this patient relapsed.
21042570:38	It has been reported that, in MS patients treated with natalizumab, there are increased numbers of circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that are chronically maintained.
21042570:39	– Although the fate of these circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and their clinical relevance for MS patients remain to be determined, it is possible that natalizumab treatment results in the generation of new lymphocytes and new functional Tregs in the patients and also in new myelinogenic or neural cells.
21042570:40	These events may account for the improved clinical condition of patient A.
21042570:41	To our knowledge, this is the first work that reports improved Treg function in an RR-MS patient who received natalizumab treatment.
21042570:42	According to a recent study, natalizumab treatment of 28 RR-MS patients resulted in a relative decrease in natural Tregs, and their impaired suppressive capacity was not restored.
21042570:43	Although a direct comparison cannot be made between patient A, who has a history of BMT, and typical RR-MS patients who are refractory to conventional treatments and are put on natalizumab, a possible explanation is that the peptide we used for the Treg functional assays is a citrullinated myelin basic protein peptide.
21042570:44	It is becoming increasingly apparent that citrullination of self-antigens is a major mechanism in triggering autoimmune/inflammatory diseases such as MS. , Future work with RR-MS patients treated with natalizumab, in comparison to other types of treatment, will clarify whether natalizumab treatment results in the generation of functional Tregs in RR-MS patients in general.

19347050:0	Introduction 
With more than 50,000 procedures per year in the US, the cornea is the most commonly transplanted solid tissue [ - ].
19347050:1	An endothelial cell (EC) monolayer covers the inner side of the endothelium, and its most important function is to pump the infiltrating liquid out of the stroma and into the anterior chamber to maintain corneal transparency.
19347050:2	In cases of corneal transplantation, immunological rejection remains one of the main obstacles for a well functioning allograft, and ECs are the critical target of rejection.
19347050:3	The EC loss results in stroma edema and a decrease of cornea graft transparency, which is an indication of rejection onset.
19347050:4	For corneal allografts, although the EC monolayer is one critical compartment, few studies have focused on its pathological response to rejection.
19347050:5	One explanation is that the opacity of rejected human corneas cannot be reversed , a situation which prevents researchers from carrying out a sufficient investigation of the underlying pathophysiology.
19347050:6	But in some animal models, a return of corneal clarity has been noted following rejection .
19347050:7	Although the interesting phenomenon of corneal allograft transparency recovery has been observed, the EC regenerative progress, including the absolute numbers of the cells and their ratio in comparison with normal corneas, has not yet been fully investigated.
19347050:8	In the present study, we used a rat corneal transplantation model to detail the kinetics of corneal allograft EC replacement in the hopes of furthering our exploration into corneal protective therapy.
19347050:9	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
According to their species, the corneal allografts exhibit different outcomes in response to rejection.
19347050:10	Human corneal EC loss leads to graft failure in clinic while in mice, 50%–60% of recipients do not undergo any rejection.
19347050:11	To find clues for promoting the efficacy of human allografts, a stable corneal rejection model is needed to investigate the underlying mechanism of rejection and graft opacity.
19347050:12	In the present study, we introduced the DA-Lewis combination in which all grafts were rejected within two weeks of transplantation as shown in .
19347050:13	The rejection was diagnosed by a marked increase of opacity grade, an indicator that has been adopted widely in this study area [ - ].
19347050:14	To further verify if the allograft opacity was indeed due to rejection, we used one isograft group as the control, which excluded the influence of immunological factors, and the result showed that the surgical trauma only induced a temporary slight edema after a successful surgery.
19347050:15	In this study, rejection destroyed the whole EC layer so that donor ECs did not exist afterward and the corneal transplants became opaque.
19347050:16	But interestingly, the graft transparency recovered gradually.
19347050:17	First, the grafts began to regain clarity around one week after rejection, a fact established by the observation that the opacity grade decreased to 2.
19347050:18	Then, the grafts reached total transparency around 18 days after rejection.
19347050:19	The time to transparency recovery represents a process of endothelium repair.
19347050:20	An extended observation of up to six months showed that this recovery exhibited a stable status, indicating that the corneal structure was reconstructed with full function.
19347050:21	We then checked the EC status in the process of transparency return and found that the dynamics of the EC recovery were time-dependent.
19347050:22	One week after rejection, the regenerative ECs covered one-third of the area of the endothelium with a similar value of EC density ratio.
19347050:23	Meanwhile, the graft function obtained a substantial improvement from opaque to opacity grade 2.
19347050:24	From the time point of three weeks after rejection, the graft recovered transparency, and the endothelium was fully recovered in the whole observation up to six months.
19347050:25	However, the EC density showed an increase inconsistent with the area recovery, exhibiting only half the level of the normal even up to six months after rejection onset.
19347050:26	Meanwhile, these ECs exhibited irregular features in both their cell morphology and distribution.
19347050:27	Subtler factors influencing the EC regeneration and proliferation and the reparative response against the transplant-related injury must surely exist, a consideration that should be further explored.
19347050:28	It is likely that the regenerative ECs developed mainly from the host endothelium.
19347050:29	First, the allograft ECs were lost due to rejection, therefore no donor-derivation existed as shown in . Furthermore, the staining results showed three interesting histological observations.
19347050:30	First, the proliferating cells were crawling across the suture as shown in Figure A1.
19347050:31	Second, the proliferating cells located together to generate a germinal center-like structure with irregular nuclear size ( B1,B2,B3).
19347050:32	Third, the proliferating cells were growing radially, indicating an active proliferation state as shown in B4.
19347050:33	Although without direct MHC haplotype evidence, it is suggested that the regenerative cells are developed from the host’s adjacent corneal endothelium.
19347050:34	In other solid organ allografts, it has been hypothesized that EC precursors are recruited from a variety of sources depending on the severity and duration of injury.
19347050:35	During limited damage, neighboring ECs will provide sufficient repair potential.
19347050:36	More severe damage may signal in-growth of ECs from adjacent host tissue, and severe damage with a full rupture of layers will lead to recruitment via circulation [ - ].
19347050:37	In this case, corneal allograft EC reparative response shows its own features related to its severe damage and cell derivation more so than other solid transplants.
19347050:38	The knowledge related to EC regeneration and replacement is valuable because it not only influences our understanding of graft characteristics but also helps in determining effective treatment approaches for protecting the graft.
19347050:39	After transplantation, frequent therapy is the main means used to protect the graft and/or modulate immune response, a practice which could alter graft EC origin [ - ].
19347050:40	However, there has until now been no treatment in clinics for the lost transparency induced by rejection.
19347050:41	We had transferred graft-protective, adenovirus-mediated nerve growth factor into the allograft ECs before transplantation in the rat model, which diminished the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, prolonged the graft survival significantly, and even resulted in zero rejection in some transplants that retained transparency.
19347050:42	Furthermore, no cell in growth from the adjacent area was found at day 12 after the transplant and only a small proportion of ECs was lost . The results encourage further study on corneal allograft EC repair and protection.
19347050:43	Our findings could contribute to establishing a proper direction for corneal therapy such as enhancing the reparative response and generating a functioning EC monolayer through the initiation of proliferation and replacement of host-derived ECs, protection of graft ECs, or building EC chimerism of graft and recipient.
19347050:44	Since corneas can be stored ex vivo for a relatively long time before transplant, preconditioning treatment to protect the ECs to construct an accommodation status by using therapy such as local therapeutic gene transfection is one option . Furthermore, the corneal graft is easily accessed following the operation so that topical treatment initiating EC chimerism or replacement could be applied locally not only on the graft but also on the recipient.
19347050:45	In conclusion, corneal allograft EC replacement represents a reparative response to transplant-related injury rather than a constant mechanism of tissue maintenance that depends on the regenerative features of ECs.
19347050:46	These new findings should be beneficial for developing new strategies for corneal therapy.
21423579:0	Introduction 
Mitochondria-driven overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and imbalanced homeostasis for endogenous metals and zinc (Zn 2+) in particular, are important co-factors in the development and progression of several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD; ).
21423579:1	Furthermore, a growing body of evidence indicates that mitochondrial failure is an early event in AD, suggesting that, along with deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau) protein, the malfunctioning of the organelles plays a synergistic role in triggering the neuronal death and cognitive decline associated with the disease (Reviewed in ).
21423579:2	For instance, enhanced ROS generation of mitochondrial origin can greatly interfere with homeostatic mechanisms regulating levels of intracellular free Zn 2+ ([Zn 2+] i), thereby producing intraneuronal [Zn 2+] i rises that generate a vicious loop leading to enhanced Zn 2+-dependent formation of ROS as well as Aβ oligomerization , . 
The rationale for addressing Zn 2+ dyshomeostasis in AD is substantial . In vitro, Zn 2+ induces the aggregation and oligomerization of Aβ and, in AD transgenic animals, in vivo release of pre-synaptic Zn 2+ from glutamatergic terminals promotes amyloid plaque formation . Moreover, recent findings in cultured neurons from triple-transgenic AD mice, the 3xTg-AD, overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and h-tau indicate that the pro-AD environment fostered by these mutants enhances ROS generation and ROS-mediated [Zn 2+] i mobilization from intracellular Zn 2+- binding proteins, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the initiation of the intraneuronal aggregation of Aβ . 
Finally, treatment with Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ chelators like clioquinol (CQ) and its derivative, PBT2, shows efficacy in reducing amyloid plaques and counteracts cognitive deficits in AD transgenic mice . Furthermore, recent clinical trials employing CQ or PBT2 have found that the compounds are also effective in protecting against the development and progression of cognitive deficits in AD patients . 
Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide found at high concentrations in glial and neuronal cells throughout the brain .
21423579:3	The functional role of carnosine is still not completely understood; however, several studies indicate that the dipeptide exerts protective actions against metal- and or Aβ-mediated toxicity by acting as anti-oxidant and free-radical scavenger , .
21423579:4	Moreover, because of its enrichment in histidine residues, carnosine has also been proposed as a chelator for divalent cations like Cu 2+ and Zn 2+.
21423579:5	Furthermore, most likely because of its chelating properties, carnosine can relieve the Zn 2+-mediated inhibition of NMDA and GABA receptors and therefore modulate neuronal excitability . Carnosine also exerts anti-aging activities by neutralizing injurious glycated proteins and aldehydic products of lipids peroxydation (i.e., acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde, and hydroxynonenal), thereby attenuating the toxicity of these bioproducts and preventing the cross-linking of glycoxidised proteins to physiological macromolecules , . In the context of AD, carnosine has been suggested as therapeutic agent given its capability to act as a metal chelator, free radical scavenger as well as an inhibitor of Aβ toxicity .
21423579:6	However, one possible limitation in employing carnosine as an anti-AD drug is that brain carnosine is rapidly inactivated by the activity of three different isoforms of the carnosine degrading enzyme, carnosinase.
21423579:7	Increased carnosinase activity has in fact been found in AD patients as well as in aging individuals and decreased plasmatic levels of carnosine have been reported in AD patients . 
In this study we investigated the potential beneficial effects of dietary carnosine supplementation (10 mM in drinking water) in 3xTg-AD mice, an AD animal model that develops amyloid- and tau-dependent pathology as well as AD-related cognitive deficits .
21423579:8	Results 
Discussion 
Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide highly expressed throughout the brain that has been suggested as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of AD, because the compound can act as an endogenous anti-oxidant, free radical- and metal ion chelator, and also has neuroprotective activity against in vitro Aβ-induced toxicity , . Thus, the major aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary carnosine supplementation in a model of AD that develops an age-related neurodegenerative phenotype that is driven by intraneuronal deposition of Aβ and accumulation of h-tau . We chose to treat only male 3xTg-AD mice as female hormones are known to negatively influence the activity of Zn 2+ transporters and differently affect the disease progression therefore producing confounding effects.
21423579:9	We chose to use PS1-KI animals as control group as these mice overexpress mutant Presenilin-1 gene (M146V substitution) but, by lacking the expression of mutant APP and h-tau, do not show Aβ or tau-dependent pathology nor AD-related cognitive deficits . 
Carnosine has been shown to protect against Zn 2+-mediated toxicity in cell cultures and that activity has been linked to the chelating properties of the compound.
21423579:10	The peptide has indeed been shown to complex Zn 2+ in acqueous solution but, to date, there were no experimental data demonstrating its chelating capability in biological systems.
21423579:11	We tested this hypothesis in cultured glial cells and show that the peptide is in fact able to chelate [Zn 2+] i.
21423579:12	In our study, we also found a very potent effect of carnosine in rescuing mitochondrial dysfunctions in aged 3xTg-AD mice.
21423579:13	As discussed above, mitochondrial deficits are emerging as key players in AD  and, in line with observations indicating that Aβ and tau synergistically impair OXPHOS complexes we found signs of potent deregulation of mitochondrial respiration in our AD mice.
21423579:14	In 3xTg-AD mice at 12–14 m.o.a., we observed a reduction in the activity of complex I, II and IV in the hippocampus as well as of complex I and IV in the cortex.
21423579:15	Interestingly, carnosine supplementation not only prevented such deficits but, in the hippocampus, we found that complexes II and IV activity of carnosine-fed AD mice actually increased over baseline.
21423579:16	Such results can be linked to the antioxidant activity of the dipeptide, a property that can prevent ROS-dependent mobilization of [Zn 2+] i.
21423579:17	Such activity can block Zn 2+-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibit the overproduction of nitric oxide a process strongly potentiated by Zn 2+ that eventually contributes to a self perpetuating mobilization of the cation.
21423579:18	In addition, carnosine may have a direct effect on Aβ deposition and mitochondrial function by acting as an osmolyte as shown in the case of its action on methylene blue and cytochrome c oxidase . 
When we analyzed the effects of carnosine on amyloid and tau pathology we found that the peptide is very effective in decreasing intraneuronal Aβ deposition in the hippocampus but does not affect the development of tau pathology.
21423579:19	Analysis of the effect of carnosine supplementation on cognitive deficits of 3xTg-AD mice showed a positive trend, indicating that it might have a beneficial role in preventing long-term memory deficits, although, this effect did not reach statistical significance.
21423579:20	The sub-maximal effect we observed could be related to the fact that carnosine is able to greatly inhibit the Aβ load but not the appearance of tau pathology and these two molecular components are definitely acting synergistically in the development of the cognitive decline , . 
In the last few years a growing body of evidence is supporting the intriguing hypothesis that the alteration in the equilibrium of brain Zn 2+ levels can be a significant contributing factor for AD . Interestingly, both excess as well as deficit of brain Zn 2+ can favour AD-like pathology in AD animal models suggesting the existence of a finely tuned Zn 2+ set point.
21423579:21	Such hypothesis has been substantiated by a recent study indicating that deficits of synaptic Zn 2+ promotes AD-like cognitive impairment by negatively interfering with glutamatergic and BDNF signalling . Thus, in such scenario, a decreased Zn 2+ bioavailability induced by carnosine supplementation may in part exert negative effects on the neurotransmission and neurotrophic signalling that modulate cognitive functions, and in doing so, counteracts the positive activity on amyloid deposition and mitochondrial functioning.
21423579:22	In that respect, it could be interesting to verify the possibility that more effective synergistic activity can be achieved when carnosine and Zn 2+ are administered together in a combined form similarly to what has been described for the compound named Polaprezinc, a preparation that combines Zn 2+ and L-carnosine . In theory, this compound, given the different K d for Zn 2+ of carnosine and Aβ can act as an homeostatic molecule that sequesters Zn 2+ from Aβ but then releases a sufficient amount of the cation in the synaptic cleft to exert neurotrophic actions.
21423579:23	Another possibility that could explain the subthreshold effect on cognition is associated with changes in carnosinase activity as the enzyme has been found to undergo an age-dependent enhanced activity in brains of aging individuals and AD patients . Finally, it is also possible that a more robust effect could be revealed by extending these behavioural studies to a larger cohort of animals.
21423579:24	In summary, carnosine has a strong effect in restoring mitochondrial functioning and in counteracting amyloid pathology but these activities do not translate in a robust effect on cognition.
21423579:25	These results suggest that, at least in complex AD animal models, addressing mitochondrial dysfunction and Aβ aggregation without a parallel intervention on h-tau deposition is not sufficient to promote major beneficial cognitive effects.
16433918:0	Background 
The heart transplant is a treatment of the heart failure, which is not responding to medications, and its efficiency is already proved: unfortunately, organ donation is a limiting step of this life-saving procedure.
16433918:1	In fact, the selection of the organs that will be transplanted is based on two factors: a suitable donor, without systemic diseases or neoplasia, active bacterial or viral infections, or anyway according to Health Guidelines.
16433918:2	For the organ "heart", an additional criterion is represented by the age; this factor is not so important in and by itself, but for the associated age-dependent risk for asymptomatic coronary artery disease or latent cardiomyopathy . Generally, the age threshold is 55 years, older donors being accepted in special cases, when the recipient's condition is very poor and represents an emergency . 
Heart donor shortage is a society problem.
16433918:3	Patients in heart transplant waiting list have a 7.3% death rate, and the average waiting time is 2 to 3 years.
16433918:4	In Italy, about 650 patients are in transplant list and only about 300 transplant are performed each year, with a plateau in the last 5 years.
16433918:5	Furthermore, there is a large amount of marginal recipients, both for advanced age (> 65 years) or co-morbidity in younger recipients . 
To counteract heart donor shortage, we should screen aged potential donor hearts for initial cardiomyopathy and functionally significant coronary artery disease: a way to select hearts "too good to die" on the basis of bedside resting and stress echo can be a critical way to solve the mismatch between donor need and supply.
16433918:6	The Adonhers (Aged Donor Heart Rescue by Stress Echo) Project was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sant'Orsola Hospital of Bologna in January 2005 (Figure ).
16433918:7	The project is now active in the Emilia-Romagna Region in its pilot phase.
16433918:8	Case report 
Discussion 
Supply of donor hearts is a critical rate-limiting step in heart transplantation.
16433918:9	An effective way to solve the current shortage would be to accept an upward shift of the age cutoff limit (from current 45 to 70 years) but age-related high prevalence of asymptomatic coronary artery disease and occult cardiomyopathy severely limit the feasibility of this approach.
16433918:10	Pharmacological stress echo is inexpensive, non-invasive and allows a simultaneous evaluation of inducible ischemia and contractile reserve of the left ventricle – therefore, it is capable to unmask prognostically meaningful occult coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy . 
The excellent prognosis associated with a negative stress echo test is already well documented by databases of thousands of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease . 
Force-Frequency relationship (FFR) is a theoretically and methodologically robust method for the assessment of left ventricular contractility and can be assessed non-invasively during exercise echo.
16433918:11	Previous studies demonstrated that an up sloping FFR better identifies hearts without latent left ventricular dysfunction than standard 5% of cutoff stress increase in LVEF . 
This first described case regards stress in special conditions – such as those occurring in a candidate donor.
16433918:12	Drug infusion may create special problems of hemodynamic instability (and, therefore, of stress tolerance) and echocardiographic feasibility and interpretation of the results.
16433918:13	For this reason, we considered ethically sound to use the organ considered suitable using this method, for transplant in recipients in emergency or suboptimal conditions.
16433918:14	It is already a current policy to transplant suitable organs removed from donors aged more than 55 years, to patients with relative contraindications to transplant.
16433918:15	In this context, a stress echo test will be a further reason of warranty for the recipient, while a change in policy based on stress echo results would only be unwarranted at this stage of evidence.
16433918:16	It is obvious that the ultimate target may be the removal of the "age factor" and its replacement with a stress echo driven selection, but this far-reaching change in selection policy has to go through several intermediate check points.
16433918:17	Conclusion 
The relevance of this case is: 
Scientific : for the first time, a largely validated technology such as stress echo is used in the critical theater of screening potential donor hearts.
16433918:18	Clinical : the efficacy of an echo-driven strategy for selecting donor heart is enormously more feasible, less expensive, and more logistically sustainable than any possible alternative strategy based on stress scintigraphy perfusion imaging or coronary angiography, which cost respectively 3 times and 10 times more than a stress echo and are much more logistically demanding.
16433918:19	Social : heart donor shortage is a society problem.
16433918:20	Patients in heart transplant waiting list have a 7.3% death rate, and the average waiting time is 2 to 3 years.
16433918:21	In Italy, about 650 patients are in transplant list and only about 300 transplants are performed each year, with a plateau in the last 5 years.
16433918:22	A better way to select hearts "too good to die" on the basis of bedside resting and stress echo can be a critical way to solve the mismatch between donor need and supply.
16433918:23	Economic : the cost of a donor heart is estimated around 200.000 € in the "transplant black market".
16433918:24	We can recruit otherwise ineligible donor at the cost of 1 stress echo, with enormous obvious downstream economic benefits.

11854361:0	Introduction 
The composition of self-peptide ligands present in the thymus plays a critical role in shaping the preimmune T cell repertoire.
11854361:1	Immature thymocytes expressing TCRs with low affinity for self-peptide/MHC survive and undergo further maturation (positive selection).
11854361:2	Overtly autoreactive T cells are deleted by induction of programmed cell death (negative selection).
11854361:3	Thereby, mature thymocytes with low affinity to self-peptide/MHC migrate to the periphery, founding a highly diverse T cell repertoire.
11854361:4	Additionally, self-peptide/MHC ligands deliver survival signals to naive T cells for their persistence in the periphery.
11854361:5	The recognition of self-peptides by T cells through the TCR has exquisite specificity as demonstrated by the drastic effects of single amino acid substitutions.
11854361:6	However, the high degree of peptide cross-reactivity built in the T cell repertoire ensures recognition of virtually any presentable peptide.
11854361:7	Synthetic peptide libraries contributed to the identification of multiple ligands that stimulate the same T cell clone without necessarily displaying sequence homology.
11854361:8	It has been estimated that the frequency of individual epitope-specific naive T cells ranges around 1–5 × 10 −5, which is below the limit of direct detection with currently available assays.
11854361:9	TCR-transgenic approaches provide model systems for monitoring the selection process and in vivo fate of naive antigen-specific T cells.
11854361:10	In humans, however, the low frequency of self-peptide–specific T cells in the preimmune repertoire has so far precluded their precise investigation.
11854361:11	The melanocyte differentiation antigen Melan-A/MART-1 (Melan-A) is a self-protein of unknown function that is expressed by melanocytes and the majority of malignant melanoma cells, but not by other tissues.
11854361:12	HLA-A2–restricted Melan-A–specific CD8 T cells have been shown to primarily recognize the Melan-A 26–35 and 27–35 peptides.
11854361:13	Using HLA-A2 multimers synthesized around the Melan-A 26–35 A27L peptide analogue, we were able to identify Melan-A–specific T cells ex vivo in both tumor-infiltrated LNs and circulating lymphocytes of melanoma patients, as well as healthy individuals.
11854361:14	In the latter, Melan-A–specific T cells are phenotypically naive (CCR7 + CD45RA high CD45RO – CD28 +), and surprisingly comprise ∼10 −3 of circulating CD8 T cells ( – ).
11854361:15	This frequency is at least 10 2 times higher than the one currently estimated for naive antigen-specific lymphocyte precursors, and is comparable to that of epitope-specific memory CD8 T cells.
11854361:16	This raises the question of how this unexpected large T cell pool is established and maintained.
11854361:17	Obviously, the surface markers used in previous studies may not reliably reflect the functional state of Melan-A–specific T cells.
11854361:18	In this regard, it has been shown that naive T cells may undergo expansion without phenotype change, or revert to a naive state after transient homeostasis-driven activation ( – ).
11854361:19	Furthermore, memory T cells may revert to a naive phenotype.
11854361:20	Alternatively, Melan-A–specific T cells may represent true naive lymphocytes due to increased life span in the periphery or increased thymic production.
11854361:21	In this study, we identified the mechanism for the existence of a large naive repertoire of T cells specific for the self-antigen Melan-A.
11854361:22	Using MHC/peptide multimers, we enumerated Melan-A–specific T cells in the thymus and periphery of newborns and adults.
11854361:23	To directly define the contribution of thymic production to this large self-specific T cell pool, we combined A2/Melan-A multimer labeling with measurement of postthymic replicative history by quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) ( – ).
11854361:24	During thymus development, formation of a productive TCR-α rearrangement requires deletion of the TCR-δ locus that is located within the TCR-α locus.
11854361:25	Before TCR-α rearrangement, two TCR-δ–deleting elements, δRec and ψJα, preferentially rearrange to each other, thereby deleting the TCR-δ locus.
11854361:26	The TCR-δ deletion product remains present as an extrachromosomal circle, the so-called signal joint TREC.
11854361:27	TRECs are episomal excision circles that are stable, do not duplicate during mitosis, and consequently are diluted during cell division.
11854361:28	We also measured the average length of telomere repeat sequences in Melan-A–specific T cells by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (flow FISH [29]), as an independent marker of their replicative history in vivo.
11854361:29	Telomeres are specialized structures at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes whose length decreases with age and population doublings in vitro.
11854361:30	Despite transient telomerase activity, the telomere length of memory CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes is significantly shorter than that of naive T cells.
11854361:31	For the first time, determination of TRECs and telomere length in antigen-specific CD8 T cells ex vivo provide direct evidence that a high frequency of thymic precursors is the predominant mechanism shaping the Melan-A–specific T cell preimmune repertoire . Implications for the presence of Melan-A cross-reactive ligands during thymic selection are discussed.

Results 
Discussion 
Although abundantly present in the mature T cell repertoire of HLA-A2 adult individuals, circulating Melan-A–specific CD8 T cells display a naive phenotype ( – ).
11854361:33	In this study, we directly identified the origin of the large Melan-A–specific T cell pool.
11854361:34	First, high numbers of Melan-A–specific T cells are already detected in CD8 SP thymocytes and are maintained in the mature T cell repertoire of newborns and adults.
11854361:35	Second, high TREC levels and long telomeres are retained in circulating Melan-A–specific T cells and are comparable with those found in autologous-naive lymphocytes.
11854361:36	Together, these results demonstrate that the shaping of the preimmune T cell repertoire specific for the self-antigen Melan-A is mostly imposed by thymic output of a high frequency of precursors.
11854361:37	Thus, the size of the circulating Melan-A–specific T cell pool in adults is at least 10 2 times larger than current estimates for naive antigen-specific lymphocyte precursors, and approaches that of epitope-specific memory CD8 T cells.
11854361:38	Melan-A–specific thymocytes cannot be found in DP cells, but become detectable in CD8 SP cells.
11854361:39	The selective detection of Melan-A–specific T cells in the latter subset may be explained by at least two reasons.
11854361:40	First, the lower levels of TCR α/β molecules on DP thymocytes may not be sufficient for efficient staining with MHC/peptide multimers.
11854361:41	Second, the frequency of Melan-A–specific thymocytes is probably highly diluted in the DP stage by the >95% cells that will not reach the SP pool.
11854361:42	Nonetheless, our findings clearly show that a high frequency of Melan-A–specific precursors is selected in the human thymus.
11854361:43	Once they have completed their thymic maturation, these cells are seeded and maintained at high numbers in the peripheral blood (∼10 −3 of circulating CD8 T cells), representing a total number of 0.5–2 × 10 6 cells.
11854361:44	Because 98% of all lymphocytes are sequestered in tissues, it is possible that 25−100 × 10 6 cells recognizing the self-antigen Melan-A persist in the peripheral lymphoid compartment.
11854361:45	In marked contrast, influenza-specific T cells are below detection both in the thymus and in newborns, and only become detectable in adult individuals, most likely driven by extensive clonal expansion in response to viral infection.
11854361:46	The simplest explanation for the high frequency of circulating Melan-A–specific CD8 T cells is peripheral expansion.
11854361:47	This possibility, however, is ruled out by parameters reflecting the replicative history of circulating Melan-A–specific T cells (TREC levels and telomere length).
11854361:48	The TREC levels in a naive T cell population at any time will be determined by factors inclusive of thymic production and T cell homeostasis (assuming no intracellular TREC decay).
11854361:49	As peripheral T cell division substantially affects the intracellular TREC content, the availability of TREC levels from thymocytes to mature peripheral lymphocytes allows the calculation of the postthymic replicative history of CD8 T cells.
11854361:50	If we first consider CB, we may estimate that on average, CD8 T cells in newborns (mean ± SD, 24 ± 5 TRECs in 100 cells) completed one to two population doublings relative to CD8 SP thymocytes (57 ± 7 TRECs per 100 cells; unpublished data).
11854361:51	Such limited cell division may be controlled by continued specific recognition of self-peptide/MHC, responsible for the persistence of mature lymphocytes in the periphery.
11854361:52	In peripheral blood of adults, CD8 T cells include two groups with distinct replicative histories.
11854361:53	Naive (CCR7 +CD45RA high) CD8 T cells (7 ± 3 TRECs per 100 cells) completed approximately three population doublings, whereas on average, memory/effector (non-CCR7 +CD45RA high) CD8 T cells (0.5 ± 0.4 TRECs per 100 cells) underwent seven population doublings in the periphery.
11854361:54	The strikingly different replicative histories of CCR7 +CD45RA high and non-CCR7 +CD45RA high subsets confirm that the combination of CCR7 and CD45RA surface markers allows the distinction of naive from memory/effector lymphocytes.
11854361:55	This conclusion is further supported by the finding that naive lymphocytes exhibit significantly longer telomeres as compared with their memory/effector counterparts.
11854361:56	Furthermore, the relative telomere length of naive lymphocytes is quite uniform, indicating that these cells represent a homogeneous population.
11854361:57	If we now consider antigen-specific CD8 T cells, Melan-A–specific T cells in CB (mean ± SD, 14 ± 4 TRECs per 100 cells) reveal a proliferative history compared with that of the whole CD8 T cell pool.
11854361:58	Likewise, Melan-A–specific T cells in peripheral blood of adults (5 ± 2 TRECs per 100 cells) resemble the naive CD8 T cell pool, as they also completed limited cell division.
11854361:59	Indeed, the data suggest that on average, Melan-A specific T cells have only completed one cell division compared with the autologous-naive subset (TREC dilution by ∼50%).
11854361:60	This may reflect a slightly increased division rate and/or prolonged life span.
11854361:61	In either case, the net effect would be the observed consistently lower TREC content as compared with the autologous naive CD8 T cells.
11854361:62	Because all Melan-A–specific T cells homogeneously retain long telomeres ex vivo, it also implies that most cells in the pool underwent a similar number of divisions.
11854361:63	In marked contrast to Melan-A–specific T cells, influenza-specific T cells have an extensive replicative history in the periphery of adults.
11854361:64	Because their TRECs are not detectable, the virus-specific T cells completed >10 population doublings.
11854361:65	In this case a single thymocyte precursor may generate >10 3 CD8 T cell progeny.
11854361:66	This is in line with the recent finding that after antigenic stimulation, naive CD8 T cells become committed to dividing at least seven times and differentiating into memory/effector cells.
11854361:67	In agreement with these data, we observed significant telomere shortening of influenza-specific T cells as compared with autologous-naive CD8 T cells.
11854361:68	Accumulating evidence indicates a central role for self-peptides in thymic selection.
11854361:69	Interestingly, previous experiments showed that Melan-A mRNA is not detectable in the thymus, which suggests that the large Melan-A–specific T cell pool might be shaped in the absence of the selecting and/or deleting ligand.
11854361:70	In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Melan-A peptide sequence, recognized by CD8 T cells from HLA-A2 individuals, is localized in the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the protein, which greatly limits the diversity of its amino acid composition.
11854361:71	Indeed, sequence homology between the Melan-A peptide and a broad range of self-derived proteins has recently been reported.
11854361:72	Consequently, recognition of Melan-A–cross-reactive ligands may play an important role in positive thymic selection by generating a large naive T cell pool.
11854361:73	Based on previous experimental work, we hypothesize that highly specific interactions between self-peptides and TCR, rather than promiscuous recognition, are driving the positive selection process.
11854361:74	However, since there is increasing evidence that a wide variety of tissue-specific antigens may be weakly expressed intrathymically, we cannot exclude the possibility that weak expression of Melan-A in the thymus may also result in the deletion of high-avidity CD8 T cells ( , ).
11854361:75	It will be important to determine which sequence motifs are involved in positive thymic selection of Melan-A–specific T cells.
11854361:76	Preliminary experiments seem to indicate that generation of the large Melan-A–specific T cell pool is not due to selection of a particular TCR.
11854361:77	Indeed, we investigated the TCR-β repertoire of Melan-A–specific CD8 T cells ex vivo in HD 009 by using multimers in conjunction with anti-CD8 and anti–TCR-β chain variable (BV) mAbs.
11854361:78	This analysis revealed that at least 13 out of 18 BV segments investigated were used (BV1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 13.1, 13.6, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22), each representing 2–10% of the whole Melan-A–specific repertoire (unpublished data).
11854361:79	It is noteworthy that analysis of complementary determining region-3 length, and sequence of activated Melan-A–specific cells in tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes from melanoma patients, indicated that these cells display a large and highly diverse TCR-β repertoire.
11854361:80	The mechanisms preventing the activation of circulating Melan-A–specific CD8 T cells are unknown.
11854361:81	It is conceivable that the lack of peripheral activation reflects ignorance.
11854361:82	Indeed, expression of Melan-A is restricted to cells of the melanocytic lineage, including subepidermal melanocytes, retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and choroidal melanocytes, which are physiologically concealed from the immune system.
11854361:83	In addition, skin melanocytes are only ∼5% of the total skin cell pool, and thus there is a relatively low abundance of the Melan-A antigen.
11854361:84	Both spatial segregation and low levels of Melan-A might explain why the circulating Melan-A–specific T cell pool is virtually never activated, despite frequent skin injury during the lifetime of adults, and thus remains ignorant.
11854361:85	In marked contrast, Melan-A–specific T cells can be activated in patients with malignant melanoma or rare autoimmune disorders.
11854361:86	The vast majority of melanoma patients contains detectable accumulations of memory/effector Melan-A–specific T cells in metastatic tumor lesions ( ).
11854361:87	Thus, in the appropriate milieu, including a high antigen load and disruption of tissue architecture brought about by tumor progression, Melan-A–specific T cells successfully overcome ignorance and undergo clonal expansion.
11854361:88	As documented here, the emergence of memory/effector lymphocytes in the Melan-A– specific T cell pool of melanoma patients is accompanied by TREC dilution and telomere shortening.
11854361:89	It has also been suggested that Melan-A–specific T cells may destroy melanocytes in the eyes of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and sympathetic ophthalmia, which are systemic inflammatory disorders that affect tissues containing melanocytes.
11854361:90	Finally, the observation of an elevated frequency of Melan-A–specific T cells in vitiligo patients also underlines the involvement of these cells in autoimmune destruction of skin melanocytes.
11854361:91	The key finding in this study is that a large pool of human-naive CD8 T lymphocytes specific for the self-antigen Melan-A can be identified and characterized by multimer staining in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid compartment of healthy individuals.
11854361:92	Our results provide direct evidence that this T cell pool is generated by thymic output of a high frequency of precursors that undergo limited cell division in the periphery.
11854361:93	It will be of great interest to identify the ligands involved in selecting and maintaining such an abundant self-specific naive T cell repertoire.
21283141:0	Introduction 
Fundamental goals for synthetic biology are to understand the principles of biological circuitry from an engineering perspective and to establish engineering methods for creating biochemical circuitry to control molecular processes—both in vitro and in vivo ( ; ).
21283141:1	As the canonical example of non-equilibrium chemical dynamics—and as a design target for synthetic systems—for more than 50 years chemical oscillators have had a central role in shaping our understanding of chemical self-organization and the mechanistic origins of life-like behavior in non-living systems ( ; ; ).
21283141:2	Known chemical oscillators are grouped into five classes: (1) biological oscillators within living cells, such as the circadian rhythm; (2) biological oscillators reconstituted in vitro ( ; ); (3) designed synthetic oscillators engineered into living organisms ( ; ; ); (4) synthetic chemical oscillators involving small molecule reactions in vitro ( ; ); and (5) synthetic biochemical oscillators designed from biological components in cell-free in vitro reactions ( ; ; ).
21283141:3	The ability to engineer the circuit architecture of synthetic oscillators makes it possible to investigate design principles by exploring the design space ( ; ; ), to challenge modeling techniques with well-defined biochemical systems of intermediate complexity ( ; ; ), and to orchestrate other molecular processes within natural and artificial chemical systems ( ; ).
21283141:4	The third class of oscillators—using in vivo synthetic biology—has already been enormously productive for these reasons.
21283141:5	However, a direct comparison between synthetic oscillator designs in vivo remains a challenge because of differences in their regulatory components as well as potential interference with other cellular networks; moreover, in vivo oscillators are not helpful for engineering systems that must avoid using biological organisms within them.
21283141:6	Consequently, the fifth category—using cell-free in vitro synthetic biology—is particularly interesting because reactions such as transcription and translation can be rewired combinatorially using synthetic DNA templates, the resulting systems can be studied and characterized without the complexities and unknowns of living cells, and the creation of artificial chemical systems with complex autonomous dynamics becomes possible ( ; ; ).
21283141:7	However, initial attempts to construct a cell-free biochemical oscillator using transcription and reverse transcription were only moderately successful, perhaps because of accumulated sequence mutations.
21283141:8	Since then, multistep reaction pathways using transcription and translation, bistable circuit dynamics using RNA transcription and degradation, and logic gates using multiple enzymes have been experimentally demonstrated, and highly efficient cell-free platforms for transcription and translation are now available ( ; ).
21283141:9	Further, theoretical models developed for these systems are capable of sustained oscillations ( ; ; ; ), suggesting that a variety of biochemical circuit architectures can in principle be synthesized and explored in cell-free reactions.
21283141:10	Here, we make use of a previously proposed class of in vitro biochemical systems, transcriptional circuits, which can be modularly wired into arbitrarily complex networks by changing the regulatory and coding sequence domains of DNA templates.
21283141:11	In principle, transcriptional circuits can be wired as continuous time analog neural networks with symmetric or asymmetric weights, implying that they are a computationally and behaviorally complete circuit architecture.
21283141:12	Individual transcriptional switches have been demonstrated experimentally to exhibit sharp sigmoidal inhibitory regulation, allowing the construction of a two-switch circuit exhibiting bistable dynamics.
21283141:13	Furthermore, a single switch with sharp sigmoidal excitatory regulation has also been demonstrated; it also exhibits bistability when configured to regulate itself.
21283141:14	Here we combine switches with inhibitory and excitatory regulation to construct and characterize three different oscillator designs with circuit architectures similar to known synthetic and natural oscillators: a two-switch oscillator utilizing both excitatory and inhibitory regulation, loosely analogous to the p53–Mdm2-feedback loop; the same oscillator augmented with a positive-feedback loop, loosely analogous to a synthetic relaxation oscillator; and a three-switch ring oscillator analogous to the repressilator.
21283141:15	Simplified mathematical models predicted that all three designs could be tuned to reach the oscillatory regime in parameter space and were useful for understanding the oscillators' principles of operation, but were not in quantitative agreement with experiments.
21283141:16	More detailed chemical kinetic models proved essential for guiding the exploration of experimental parameters to achieve oscillations, but further extensions to the model were required to account for the build-up of incomplete RNA degradation products that interfered with the designed interactions.
21283141:17	To our surprise, the two-switch oscillator was remarkably robust to the accumulation of this interfering RNA ‘waste'.
21283141:18	The successful implementation of three oscillator designs underscores the potential of in vitro circuitry, but our experience also serves as a warning of the challenges posed by unintended reactions even after the uncertainties and complexities of living cells have been removed.
21283141:19	Results 
Discussion 
Proposing theoretical models of synthetic biochemical oscillators is easier than implementing them successfully in the laboratory.
21283141:20	Indeed, a previous attempt to create an in vitro biochemical oscillator using reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase yielded excellent oscillatory behavior in theory and every designed reaction step was shown to occur.
21283141:21	Yet, sustained oscillations were not reported, perhaps because of accumulated sequence mutations, as both DNA and RNA were synthesized and degraded.
21283141:22	In contrast, in our transcriptional networks, only RNA is synthesized and degraded, whereas DNA molecules are preserved, thus grounding the dynamics.
21283141:23	Furthermore, our transcriptional switches are capable of producing a threshold response with a high input/output gain and low background, which is essential for driving system dynamics from the stable regime into the oscillatory regime.
21283141:24	With the successful implementation of three oscillator designs here, together with previous implementations of bistable dynamics ( ; ), transcriptional networks are beginning to live up to their promise as a powerful architecture for systematic and modular construction of dynamic circuitry in vitro . The modularity and flexibility of our oscillator architecture were highlighted by the fact that a single additional DNA strand was required to transform the Design I to the Design II oscillator.
21283141:25	A possible extension would be the addition of one more DNA strand for a switch Sw22 (which possesses the regulatory domain of Sw12 and the output domain of Sw21) that would add a self-regulating negative-feedback loop producing an analog to the in vivo oscillator reported by (cf., ), the most robust synthetic oscillator demonstrated so far.
21283141:26	In principle, not only can transcriptional networks be wired up by sequence design to form arbitrary neural network or boolean logic circuits, but also—as illustrated here—even simple circuits can be tuned to elicit a wide range of behaviors simply by adjusting the concentrations of switch and threshold molecules.
21283141:27	However, several significant difficulties must be considered.
21283141:28	First, to emphasize that all observed dynamics are due to chemistry and not due to the experimental apparatus, we have exclusively run closed batch reactions.
21283141:29	Consequently, the reactions have a limited lifetime as sources of material and energy (such as NTPs) are used up, enzymes stop working, and waste products accumulate (cf., ).
21283141:30	If these constraints were to be relaxed, e.g., by using a chemostat, a dialysis bag, or vesicles, we anticipate that sustained limit cycle oscillations could be observed for all three oscillator designs investigated here.
21283141:31	Furthermore, we must recognize that waste products, from incomplete degradation and abortive or promiscuous transcription, form a second independent difficulty.
21283141:32	As seen here, waste products can interfere with intended reactions and dynamically change phenomenological rate constants, making systems behavior difficult to model and control.
21283141:33	This ‘noise' in the form of unknown partial degradation and transcription products is quite different in character from the more commonly studied noise of stochastic reactions and uncertainties in rate constants.
21283141:34	Whereas in vivo systems will dilute waste products during exponential growth phase, our in vitro systems can be limited by ribonuclease saturation, complicating the elimination of waste products.
21283141:35	Although identifying more effective degradation pathways would be of considerable help, the deeper issue is to understand how to design circuits whose behavior is robust to interference from a spectrum of unknown molecular species.
21283141:36	We saw hints of such robustness in the difference between the Design I oscillator, which responded to accumulation of waste by a compensatory increase in RNA signal concentration while maintaining oscillations, and the Design III oscillator, which responded with damped oscillations unless it was in the ‘spiraling out' regime.
21283141:37	The combination of waste products and other unknown species and interactions creates a third difficulty, that of predictive modeling.
21283141:38	This problem is particularly apparent in the asymmetry of switch components.
21283141:39	For example, in the Design I oscillator, the simple model assumes symmetric switch characteristics and produces comparable-amplitude oscillation of both switches, as does the detailed model when provided with symmetric parameters.
21283141:40	Random sampling of the detailed model using symmetric parameter ranges suggested initial experimental conditions that did, in fact, lead to relatively large amplitudes for both switches, although only as damped oscillations (e.g., reaction #1).
21283141:41	Nevertheless, asymmetric switch behaviors became more pronounced while optimizing experimental conditions to achieve sustained oscillation.
21283141:42	This could be attributable to the influence of various waste species, to unintended secondary structure in designed single-stranded species, to unintended binding between strands, or to interactions between fluorophores, quenchers, and DNA ( ; ), any of which could differentially slow down only certain hybridization or strand displacement reactions.
21283141:43	Such asymmetric behaviors can be captured in the detailed and extended models a posteriori by the phenomenological fitting parameters; yet they make predictive modeling and design difficult.
21283141:44	These difficulties go against the original spirit of this work, which was to simplify the in vivo repressilator by constructing an analogous in vitro oscillator that could be more rigorously characterized and modeled, thanks to the knowledge of exactly what went into the test tube and to the absence of a myriad of unknown species and reactions within the living cell.
21283141:45	Yet, in our hands, the in vitro systems were still too complex for satisfactory quantitative and predictive modeling: ‘simple models' were useful for theoretically characterizing the phase diagrams of possible behaviors, but parameters could only be roughly mapped to experimental conditions; ‘detailed models' were effective for identifying promising experimental conditions and gave us confidence in the major reaction pathways but failed to account for several striking features observed experimentally; and ‘extended models' could qualitatively account for these features but still failed to quantitatively match some experimental traces even when fit a posteriori .
21283141:46	With up to 18 dynamic variables and 33 system parameters, the latter models inevitably yield fits with several ill-constrained and phenomenological parameters, implying that sophisticated Bayesian methods would be required to make effective predictions ( ; ).
21283141:47	Thus, our experience is somewhat in contrast to the optimistic perspectives of and for predictive synthetic biology in vivo —perhaps because the in vitro setting allows us to more easily appreciate the scope of the difficulties, or perhaps because living cells are effective at creating an insulated and reliable local environment for circuit function.
21283141:48	In any case, it is natural to expect that in vitro and in vivo biochemical networks are governed by many similar design principles.
21283141:49	Our in vitro oscillators exhibit several design principles previously observed in vivo . (1) Introducing delay in a simple negative-feedback loop can help achieve stable oscillation ( ; ), as obtained by high activation and inhibition thresholds in the Design I oscillator.
21283141:50	(2) The addition of a positive-feedback self-loop to a negative-feedback oscillator provides access to rich dynamics and improved tunability, as illustrated in the simple model phase diagram for the Design II oscillator.
21283141:51	(3) Oscillations in biochemical ring oscillators (such as the repressilator) are sensitive to parameter asymmetry among individual components, which crippled our original design for the three-switch ring oscillator (Design III) and necessitated adjustments of switch and threshold concentrations even with the redesigned sequences reported here.
21283141:52	(4) The saturation of degradation machinery and the management of waste products can have a surprisingly large role for establishing logical regulation at steady state ( ; ) and for improving the robustness of oscillators ( ; ).
21283141:53	(It is possible that these issues could be part of the explanation for the lack of robustness and the arrest of oscillation upon entry of E. coli into stationary phase for the repressilator.)
21283141:54	All this begs the question of whether even simpler or more robust biochemical oscillators can be designed for in vitro studies.
21283141:55	In biology, minimal circuitry required for oscillation can be quite simple, as exemplified by the circadian clock of cyanobacteria that requires only three proteins and ATP fuel to function when reconstituted in vitro.
21283141:56	Indeed, recent work has shown the de novo design and implementation of an in vitro biochemical oscillator even simpler than any of ours.
21283141:57	However, an alternative view—which we take—is that increasing complexity is inevitable if we wish to create and explore increasingly interesting and powerful information-based chemical systems; hence, we will have to learn how to deal with it one way or another, and cell-free in vitro systems offer a valuable training ground.
21283141:58	Natural next steps would be to improve our characterization and modeling of our oscillators by independent measurements of each reaction; to implement more robust oscillator designs; to couple them to other chemical processes such as DNA nanomachines and thereby control temporal self-organization; to prepare them as two-dimensional reaction-diffusion media and thereby control spatial self-organization; to express them within cell-like volumes to examine stochastic behavior; and to integrate them with other transcriptional circuitry to provide embedded controllers within prototype artificial cells such as water-in-oil emulsions and vesicles.

17118151:0	Background 
Signals recorded from the surface of the cerebral cortex are composites of the electrical activity of a large number – probably millions to billions – of individual cells.
17118151:1	Therefore, one would expect that several different processes – each produced by a different neuronal structure with a characteristic activity pattern – would be occurring simultaneously.
17118151:2	The critical question here is: Can these superimposed signal patterns be separated and analyzed independently?
17118151:3	In order to address that issue, we propose to utilize an experimental technique based on measuring neural activity in a controlled setting (normal) as well as under exposure to some external stimulus – nicotine, in this case . Application of stimuli that affect the observed signals often has an effect only on a subset of the sources.
17118151:4	The information about which sources are affected by the stimuli can provide an interesting insight into the problem of neural activity analysis, but cannot be measured directly.
17118151:5	Based on the assumption that each of the sources produces a signal that is statistically independent of the others, the observed signals can be decomposed into constituents that model the sources, also referred to as basis functions.
17118151:6	Each of the observed signals is a linear combination of those modeled sources.
17118151:7	Due to the fact that some sources influence some locations stronger than others, each source can be present in each observed signal with a different magnitude.
17118151:8	The magnitudes are modeled as coefficients in the aforementioned linear combination.
17118151:9	The change in the coefficients, as a result of applied stimuli, corresponds to the change in the contribution of a source in generation of a given signal.
17118151:10	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can be useful in this kind of analysis, as it allows for determination of an impact of the external stimuli on some specific neuronal structures, supposedly represented by the discovered components.
17118151:11	The link between the stimulus and a given source can be verified by a classifier that is able to "predict" under which condition a given signal was registered, solely based on the discovered independent components.
17118151:12	The general idea behind all decomposition techniques is to represent the original signal x in terms of some basis functions M and a set of coefficients a with an addition of some noise or, simply, error e : 
x = Ma + e .       (1) 
With this approach, the temporal properties of the system are preserved by the basis functions.
17118151:13	The original sequences are replaced by a set of scalar coefficients that represent the original data in the space spanned by the basis functions.
17118151:14	The process of reconstruction into the original input space is simply based upon a linear combination of the basis functions (i.e ., a sum of the basis functions weighted by the coefficients).
17118151:15	For example, the following artificially generated dataset consisting of three sequences y 1, y 2, y 3 belonging to one of the two categories A and B each (Fig. ), can be replaced by two basis functions m 1, m 2 (Fig. ) and a new dataset consisting of the coefficients a 1, a 2, (Fig. ), for the basis functions m 1, m 2 respectively, that will represent the original vectors y 1, y 2, y 3 in the new attribute space . 
Such a transformation can be very useful for classification.
17118151:16	The feature space has been tremendously reduced (i.e ., instead of operating on vectors with 100 values each, just two numbers are being used) and the task becomes straightforward – in this example, even a single decision rule will be sufficient to classify the signals in the database without error.
17118151:17	In the above example, the signals of class A are those that contain both the sinusoidal and the square pulse components, while the type B sequences have no square component at all.
17118151:18	This could possibly be deduced from the analysis of the shapes of the signals, but can also be based upon the analysis of the coefficients and some simple classification rule generation (e.g ., IF a 2 is 0, THEN Class is B, ELSE Class is A).
17118151:19	This is a very simple, synthetic example, so the classes are known a priori; however, one can imagine a "real-life" problem where such a solution would be very desirable.
17118151:20	For example, assuming that signals in class B are registered right after an application of some external stimulus, one could conclude that the stimulus inhibits the source that generates the square pulse, but has no apparent influence on the source related to the sinusoidal component.
17118151:21	Over the years, various decomposition techniques have been successfully applied to the domain of signal classification.
17118151:22	Unquestionably, one of the most commonly used methods for that task is Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
17118151:23	Even though it proves to be a powerful and often successful tool, one of the main weaknesses of ICA is its assumption about the statistical independence of the components – this will rarely be sufficient for a successful differentiation between signals that belong to different classes.
17118151:24	Another important flaw of ICA is the fact that the cardinality of the resultant set of independent components is always the same as the number of the input signals.
17118151:25	This poses a difficult question as to the importance of the discovered components for a given classification task: which of the components explain the classification in the best possible way?
17118151:26	This can also become a major computational problem, especially with a large size of the analyzed database.
17118151:27	Thus the idea of combining the premises of a reliable and accurate decomposition of signals (verifiable via the reconstruction process) with the determination of the components that really matter in terms of segregation of the input sequences into separate categories seems plausible.
17118151:28	Classificatory decomposition (CD) is a general term that describes our research study that attempts to improve the effectiveness of signal decomposition techniques by providing them with "classification-awareness".
17118151:29	The description of previous stages of the study and some examples of applications can be found in [ - ].
17118151:30	In this article, we investigate hybridization of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) and rough sets (RS) to perform decomposition in the light of the classification problem itself.
17118151:31	The idea is to look for basis functions whose coefficients allow for an accurate classification while preserving the reconstruction.
17118151:32	We propose a simple extension of the well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm VEGA , which we call end-VEGA (elitist-non-dominated-VEGA).
17118151:33	The extension, in its initial form introduced in , supplies the algorithm with the considerations related to elitism and non-dominance, lack of which is known to be its main drawback . We also investigate the idea of utilizing ICA to initialize the population in the MOEA.
17118151:34	The details of the modifications as well as a short theoretical background are given below.

Results and Discussion 
Conclusion 
This article presents a general framework for the methodology of classificatory decomposition of signals based on hybridization of independent component analysis, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and rough sets.
17118151:36	In order to investigate the impact of the stimulus on the sources of neural activity, we designed a classification system that is capable of "predicting" if a given signal was registered under one or the other condition, solely based on the decomposition coefficients.
17118151:37	Thus the relation between the stimuli and the sources can be analyzed.
17118151:38	The preliminary results described here are very promising and further investigation of other MOEAs and/or RS-based classification accuracy measures should be pursued.
17118151:39	The incorporation of ICA-derived basis functions and coefficients as the starting point in the MOEA significantly improved the reconstruction error and more closely related the concept of classificatory decomposition to the traditional signal decomposition techniques.
17118151:40	On the other hand, one of the main advantages of our approach is the fact that rather than solely relying on often unrealistic assumptions about statistical independence of sources, it generates a reduced set of components that are relevant in the light of a given classification problem itself.
17118151:41	The modifications in end-VEGA, although they improved the reconstruction slightly and sped up the overall convergence of the algorithm as compared to previous experiments, worked much better in tandem with ICA.
17118151:42	In future research, it would be interesting to apply the results obtained using other decomposition approaches, e.g ., Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  or Sparse Coding with Overcomplete Bases (SCOB) , as the initial population in MOEA.

18851757:0	Introduction 
Opioid drugs such as morphine are a class of powerful analgesics used for treating many forms of acute and chronic pain.
18851757:1	However, their chronic use has been limited by undesirable side effects such as tolerance, abnormal pain sensitivity, and physical dependence . These undesirable symptoms are believed to be related to neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS).
18851757:2	Several lines of research have shed light on molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the development of opioid analgesic tolerance and dependence [ - ].
18851757:3	Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or targeted disruption of NMDAR subunit NR2 genes significantly attenuates symptoms of opioid tolerance and physical dependence, implicating involvement of NMDARs in the development of opioid-induced neuronal plasticity [ - ].
18851757:4	However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity during the development of opioid tolerance and physical dependence are unclear.
18851757:5	PSD ( ost ynaptic ensity)-93, also named chapsyn ( annel- ssociated rotein of apses)-110, is one of a growing superfamily of PDZ-domain-containing proteins shown to physically link proteins together into macromolecular structures . PSD-93 was identified to have structural similarity with three other PDZ-domain-containing proteins, PSD-95/SAP ( ynapse- ssociated rotein) 90 , SAP102 , and SAP97/hdlg . These proteins are generically referred to as membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) and contain three tandem PDZ domains (PDZ1-3) at the N-terminal side, an Src homology region 3 domain in the middle, and a guanylate kinase-like domain at the C-terminal end.
18851757:6	PDZ domains of MAGUKs are motifs of ~90 amino acid repeats that have recently been recognized to mediate protein-protein interactions.
18851757:7	Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the PDZ domains of PSD-93 specifically bind to the C-termini of NMDAR subunits NR2A and NR2B . The deletion of PDZ domains from PSD-93 not only disrupts interaction between NR2A/NR2B and PSD-93, but also reduces NMDAR clustering at cellular membranes in vitro . Targeted disruption of the PSD-93 gene reduces NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic function in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex and attenuated NMDAR-mediated persistent pain .
18851757:8	However, a recent study reported that PSD-93 knockout (KO) mice displayed normal NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic response in hippocampal neurons . It appears that the roles of PSD-93 in synaptic NMDAR targeting and NMDAR-dependent physiologic and pathologic processes in the CNS are still unclear.
18851757:9	In the present study, we examined whether PSD-93 deficiency affected synaptic NR2A and NR2B expression in two major pain-related regions , spinal cord and forebrain cortex, and a motor and coordination-related region , cerebellum, of the CNS.
18851757:10	Furthermore, we examined whether PSD-93 was required for NMDAR-dependent development of neuronal plasticity during morphine tolerance and physical dependence.
18851757:11	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
An important observation in the present study is that PSD-93 deficiency produces distinct effects on synaptic NMDAR expression in different regions of the CNS.
18851757:12	Evidence from in vitro studies shows that PSD-93 clusters and anchors NMDARs at synapses through interaction of its PDZ domains with seven C-terminal amino acids of NR2A and NR2B . Our quantitative Western blot analysis showed that PSD-93 deficiency significantly reduced the levels of NR2A and NR2B proteins in the synaptosomal membrane fractions of dorsal horn and forebrain cortex but did not affect their expression in the total soluble fractions of these two regions.
18851757:13	This finding is consistent with our previous in vitro study, which showed that surface NR2A and NR2B expression is dramatically reduced in cultured dorsal horn neurons of KO mice . The data suggest that PSD-93 is required for synaptic expression and localization of NR2A and NR2B in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex.
18851757:14	However, PSD-93 deficiency did not markedly change the amounts of NR2A and NR2B in either synaptosomal or total soluble fractions from cerebellum.
18851757:15	Hippocampus neurons in PSD-93 KO mice may also express normal levels of NR2A and NR2B at synapses because PSD-93 deletion does not alter NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and potentials in hippocampus neurons . It appears that the effect of PSD-93 deletion on NR2A and NR2B synaptic expression may be tissue specific in the CNS, although the detailed mechanisms underlying these events are still unclear.
18851757:16	PSD-95 and SAP102, two members of the MAGUK family of proteins, also interact with NR2A and NR2B .
18851757:17	It is very likely that PSD-95 and SAP102 compensate for the deficiency of PSD-93 to anchor and target NMDARs at synapses in hippocampus and cerebellum neurons of PSD-93 KO mice.
18851757:18	Spinal cord and forebrain cortex are two major pain-related regions in the CNS . Our previous studies demonstrated that PSD-93, NR2A, and NR2B are highly expressed in the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord . Under electron microscopy, the sections from superficial dorsal horn and the anterior cingular cortex of forebrain exhibited double labeling for PSD-93 and NR2A/NR2B in the postsynaptic density . Furthermore, by co-immunoprecipitation, we found that both NR2A and NR2B were immunopreciptated by PSD-93 antibody in the postsynaptic density fractions of the spinal cord and forebrain cortex .
18851757:19	These findings demonstrate PSD-93 binding to NMDARs in the spinal cord and forebrain cortex in vivo . Electrophysiological recordings showed that PSD-93 deletion reduced NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic responses in these two regions of adult mice . Behavioral study revealed that mice lacking PSD-93 exhibited blunted NMDAR-dependent persistent pain induced by peripheral nerve injury or injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant, although they displayed intact nociceptive responsiveness to acute pain . The present study showed that PSD-93 deficiency significantly inhibited acute and chronic morphine analgesic tolerance, enhancing formalin-induced pain behaviors, and withdrawal-induced jumping following repeated morphine injection.
18851757:20	Morphine-induced tolerance, abnormal pain hypersensitivity, and physical dependence are considered to be related to NMDAR-dependent neuronal plasticity in the CNS [ - ].
18851757:21	Thus, it is very likely that these impaired morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence in PSD-93 KO mice is attributed to PSD-93 deletion-induced reduction in postsynaptic expression and function of NMDARs in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex neurons.
18851757:22	Hippocampal NMDARs play a critical role in neuronal plasticity underlying learning and memory , whereas cerebellar NMDARs are involved in the modulation of motor learning and coordination . Because PSD-93 deletion does not affect synaptic NMDAR expression and NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic functions in these two non-pain-related regions , PSD-93 deletion does not produce hippocampal and cerebellar dysfunctions, but does attenuate the development of persistent pain and morphine tolerance and physical dependence.
18851757:23	Thus, targeted disruption of PSD-93 or perturbing NMDAR-PSD-93 interaction might be a better strategy for prevention and/or treatment of persistent pain and opioid tolerance and physical dependence in clinic.
18851757:24	It should be noted that PSD-93 also functions as a scaffolding protein to assemble a specific set of signaling proteins around the NMDARs.
18851757:25	These signaling proteins, such as neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS), participate in downstream signaling by the NMDARs.
18851757:26	The PDZ domain of nNOS interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-93 . Deleting the PDZ domain from PSD-93 reduces NOS activity . Our previous study showed that targeted disruption of PSD-93 gene significantly attenuates the NMDA-stimulated increase in cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate in the cultured forebrain cortex neurons . Given that inhibition of nNOS attenuates the development of persistent pain and morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence , it is very likely that the dissociation of NMDARs from NO signaling caused by PSD-93 deletion is also involved in the mechanism underlying impairing persistent pain and morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence in the KO mice.
18851757:27	Besides NMDARs and nNOS, PSD-93 binds to other postsynaptic membrane proteins, such as potassium channels , δ 2 glutamate receptors , and the microtubule-associated protein 1A . Therefore, the detailed mechanism through which PSD-93 deficiency affects the development of neuronal plasticity in persistent pain and morphine tolerance and physical dependence remains to be explored.
18851757:28	In conclusion, the present study was the first to demonstrate that PSD-93 deletion has distinct effects on synaptic NMDAR expression in the CNS.
18851757:29	Blunted NMDAR-dependent neuronal plasticity following repeated morphine injection in PSD-93 KO mice is attributed to PSD-93 deletion-induced alterations of NR2A and NR2B postsynaptic expression in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex neurons, but not in cerebellar neurons.
18851757:30	Our findings suggest that PSD-93 might be a potential biochemical target for the treatment of opioid tolerance and physical dependence.

Results 
Discussion 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of the Narconon drug education program to produce a long-term impact on students' drug use behaviors in a universal (all student) classroom setting.
18348735:1	To a large degree, baseline survey responses were similar to drug use patterns seen in large national surveys.
18348735:2	After controlling for pretest levels of use, at six months after receiving the drug prevention curriculum students in the drug education group had lower levels of current drug use than students in the comparison group.
18348735:3	Significant reductions were observed for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana – important categories of drug abuse for this population – as well as certain categories of "hard drugs" including controlled prescription drugs, cocaine, and ecstasy.
18348735:4	The results in Table show a clear and reliable tendency among every category tested for the drug education program to produce reductions in drug use behavior.
18348735:5	This is encouraging in light of the evaluation being designed to provide a "real world" test of the Narconon program under the normal conditions of operating a classroom based intervention.
18348735:6	Inherent barriers to administering the program and evaluation while schools were in session, including assessing its effectiveness with self-report questionnaires, leads to modest measurable differences between the drug education groups and the control groups with relatively large error terms.
18348735:7	The use of the CSAT survey methodology does not make quantifying the reductions in drug use possible and that was not an aim of this evaluation.
18348735:8	Importantly, by testing a universal audience, rather than selecting groups of high risk students, the mathematical differences between student responses in each category remained modest due to the majority of students indicating no drug use at baseline.
18348735:9	The CSAP questions testing the hypothesis that changes in attitudes and beliefs would be modified by the drug education program, argue for a mediating effect on substance use.
18348735:10	Interestingly, the questions aimed at discerning whether new knowledge was obtained and retained over time, although indicating an overall pre-existing acquaintance with the data, nonetheless categorically produced the most statistically significant changes.
18348735:11	Primarily an education strategy (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment classification ), the Narconon program includes approaches that align with key prevention theories.
18348735:12	Throughout the curriculum, persuasive communication is emphasized as the means to impart each component . Competency enhancement is accomplished through student interaction  and after-school personal inspection of media and other environmental influences aimed at addressing social influences.
18348735:13	Science based information is presented, and students complete exercises aimed at developing their ability to assess the correctness of messages presented as information from a variety of sources.
18348735:14	Originally researched on cigarette use by Evans and colleagues in 1976, social influence theory was one of the first strategies to produce an impact on drug use behavior.
18348735:15	This theory posits that alcohol and other drug use among young people is primarily a social behavior strongly influenced by social motives, a complex and reciprocal interaction between both personal and environmental factors including both overt and covert pressure from friends and others to conform to what is depicted as the group norm.
18348735:16	A major departure from previous approaches to tobacco, alcohol, and other drug abuse prevention; Evans work emphasized increasing awareness of the various social pressures promoting drug use, including media influences .
18348735:17	One well-popularized aspect of today's social influences model is the focus on social resistance skills training.
18348735:18	However, programs based primarily on resistance training have shown mixed results . While this is not a focus of the Narconon program, students who received the curriculum were more likely to say they could now resist pressures to use drugs compared with those who did not receive this program.
18348735:19	Interestingly, both groups answered similarly about their ability to resist pressures in the past.
18348735:20	Instead of directly practicing resistance skills, the Narconon drug education curriculum provides an opportunity for youth to inspect a myriad of positive, negative and often conflicting messages regarding drugs and their abuse, messages that often include incorrect and conflicting information about drugs and their effects.
18348735:21	Program developers believe that prevention effectiveness is currently compromised by the pervasiveness of conflicting messages, including popular prevention approaches that do not communicate a consistent message.
18348735:22	Attempts to promote abstinence contrast with other messages heard in and out of school.
18348735:23	For example, the notion that "everyone will experiment" has lead to various, sometimes controversial, practices aimed at reducing harm . Goodstadt argues that dichotomies such as "licit" versus "illicit" drugs, or simply "good" versus "bad" drugs, result in ambiguities and problems . Petosa adds that legal definitions designating certain recreational drug as "licit" for adults but "illicit" for adolescents may encourage young people to use those drugs to demonstrate their transition to adulthood . The current prevalence of media advertising for prescription medications sends another powerful message , one complicated by the fact that commonly prescribed medications are too often used in ways substantially inconsistent with diagnostic guidelines .
18348735:24	Although students may "know" a certain datum about drugs, conflicting messages such as these may cause that datum to be minimized or rejected entirely unless placed in correct context or inspected relative to other information.
18348735:25	To address this, the program teaches about the often subtle pro-drug advertising and other environmental messages aimed at increasing tobacco, alcohol and other drug consumption; contrasting these pro-drug messages with true scientific facts about drug effects on the body, mind, emotions, and enjoyment.
18348735:26	Program facilitators purposefully encourage students to arrive at their own conclusions regarding the data presented based on each student's own observation of the topic under discussion.
18348735:27	Facilitators do not tell students what to think, rather, they teach students how to observe.
18348735:28	Another environmental influence addressed by the Narconon program includes more accurate awareness of family and peer drug use patterns.
18348735:29	The program includes modules to review and discuss personal observations and provide opportunity for youth to work out what are correct and pro-survival norms.
18348735:30	Media, family, peer and other environmental influences become the subject of competency enhancement activities included in the Narconon curriculum.
18348735:31	Competency to observe is applied during after-school practicals and becomes subject of the subsequent group discussion.
18348735:32	These take home assignments and classroom activities are also aimed at developing broader personal and social skills with peers, family and community members.
18348735:33	Research supports the use of activities that improve interpersonal relations, self esteem, communication, and other skills as directly applicable to substance use as well as many other adolescent problems.
18348735:34	Such activities appear to generally enhance program effects .
18348735:35	With respect to the importance of knowledge, while many early prevention programs gave individuals accurate facts about the harmful effects of alcohol and other drugs, theorizing that those individuals would reduce or avoid drug use because it was in their own best interest to do so, studies of this generic information-only or awareness model have led to one of the very few universally agreed-upon facts in the prevention field: That is, for the vast majority of individuals, simple awareness through passive receipt of health information is not enough to lead them to alter their present behavior or reduce their present or future use of drugs . 
According to Botvin and Botvin ., inclusion of information remains a necessary component of substance abuse education, although information alone is not sufficient to reduce or prevent use.
18348735:36	Evans stresses the importance of attention and comprehension of the contents of the message . Narconon program developers posit that true information correctly communicated can lead to changed behavior by changing the perceived value or social acceptance of that information.
18348735:37	Since inception, Narconon prevention training materials have emphasized correct communication of information and interaction with the communicator.
18348735:38	Facilitator training aligns with the five component communication persuasion model described by McGuire . According to this theory, to be effective an educator must get and hold the listeners' attention, must be understandable (comprehension), must elicit acceptance on the part of the person exposed to the message (yielding), the acceptance must be retained over time (retention), and thereby be translated into action in appropriate situations.
18348735:39	Testing the ability to choose a correct answer only begins to answer the question of the perceived value and usefulness of that information.
18348735:40	To that end, the incorporation of persuasive communication into facilitator training and multi-media program components is suggestive.
18348735:41	In theory, the communication of science-based information regarding the nature and effects of drugs can assist students in developing judgment and awareness, but only to the extent that the message sent is very real to youths and delivered in a way that students respect and can appreciate.
18348735:42	Measurements of student satisfaction that include affective reactions (e.g. enjoyment, content value) should be further explored as they may reveal important shifts in perceptions about the information itself that would not be detected in simple "true/false" questions.
18348735:43	This theory is supported by a previous evaluation of 1045 post-program student surveys, published in 1995, with findings that the Narconon program format was engaging and appreciated by youths . Participants also reported heightened perceptions of risk – including a shift in attitude among the borderline group of students who held the view that they might use drugs in the future.
18348735:44	Eighty six percent of the students in this category stated that the session they had attended changed their mind; most stating that they were now more concerned about the effects of drugs or that they had not realized that drugs were so damaging.
18348735:45	In addition to analyzing elements of content and implementation, a recent synthesis of characteristics common to exemplary prevention programs by Winters, et al.  raises the issue of management structure and sustainability.
18348735:46	Narconon International's corporate and regional offices provide centralized management and assistance to ensure that local prevention offices receive meaningful attention and support.
18348735:47	In addition to the questionnaire used in this study, Narconon program staff continued to collect their own feedback evaluations for ongoing quality management.
18348735:48	Staff interaction with teachers and community members helped the schools further reinforce the prevention messages.
18348735:49	The report by Winters, et al.  points out the broad lack of programs aimed at high school years and, interestingly, the need for multiple sessions in future years to reinforce the message.
18348735:50	The Narconon high school curriculum helps fill this need.
18348735:51	Existing materials for younger ages should also be developed into an age appropriate curriculum to provide a continuum of educational resources.
18348735:52	As the program further develops its training materials for professional facilitators it may consider also making them appropriate for peer leader groups who may particularly benefit through improved communication skills.
18348735:53	The program should also develop appropriate universal booster sessions and provide educator consultation.
18348735:54	Project findings may have policy implications regarding both setting goals and objectives for prevention programs as well as evaluating their success.
18348735:55	For example, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities act of 1994 includes "slow recently increasing rates of alcohol and drug use among school-aged children by 2000" among the six performance indicators chosen for assessing program accomplishments.
18348735:56	It also expects prevention to "realize continuous improvement in the percentage of students reporting negative attitudes toward drug and alcohol use between now and 2002".
18348735:57	Further, this act is subject to requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) in requiring local and state education agencies to monitor program effectiveness, for which the CSAT instrument is a recommended tool sanctioned by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
18348735:58	Unfortunately, the instrument is unable to quantify change in drug use and does not assess completely the factors that might lead to such a change, factors that may include change in knowledge and the perceived value of that knowledge.
18348735:59	As current youth drug use levels remain high, it is clear that much more remains to be learned regarding effective drug abuse prevention.
18348735:60	What works best; what goals additional to reduction in youth drug use – if achieved – constitute an effective program; how to measure achievement and the extent to which a school-based implementation strategy can counter other influences remains under discussion.
18348735:61	Conclusion 
As an intensive, eight-module, educational curriculum, the Narconon program has thorough grounding in theory and substance abuse etiology, incorporating several important and historically successful prevention components.
18348735:62	This supports the prediction that participants in this classroom-based program would change their behavior regarding drugs of abuse.
18348735:63	Further, the Narconon network provides a strong organizational structure to foster sustainable and high fidelity program implementation.
18348735:64	In this evaluation, the Narconon drug education curriculum produced reliable reductions in drug use a full six months after completion of the drug education program and in every category of drug use tested.
18348735:65	A third of these questions – those assessing the drugs most commonly used by youths; alcohol, tobacco and marijuana as well as "hard drugs" – showed statistically significant reductions in use.
18348735:66	The reductions achieved with both amphetamines and non-prescription use of amphetamines are important given recent increases in availability and initiation of these drugs.
18348735:67	The reliability of the reductions measured in drug abuse behavior provide the most relevant support for the Narconon drug education curriculum.
18348735:68	The program's ability to produce reductions in drug use behavior appears to be through correcting prevalent but false messages while empowering youth to observe, draw their own conclusions, and potentially also improves interpersonal skills contributing to the development of appropriate group norms.
18348735:69	These changes may result in shifts in perception of risk and corrected attitudes as individuals and as a group.
18348735:70	However, the mechanisms of action for this program should be further explored using sensitive instruments and analyses designed to test this hypothesis.
18348735:71	Although the CSAP questionnaire underwent an extensive development process, isolating effective components of drug prevention programs may require a more robust methodology, particularly in light of the theory constructs of this program.
18348735:72	The Narconon drug education curriculum for high school grades shows clearly positive results and sends an important and powerful message promoting abstinence.
18348735:73	Given the significant reductions in drug use behavior, the scientific content and social influence theory underlying the program materials and their implementation, and the strong, centralized management by Narconon International, this program is very promising and fills a vital need in substance abuse prevention.

19161590:0	Background 
Despite improvements in medical management of spinal cord injury, re-hospitalisation rates remain high, with an increased incidence in conditions associated with the genitourinary system (urinary tract infections), respiratory complications, and pressure ulcers .
19161590:1	Among the reasons for the readmissions of spinal cord injury patients, evaluation and care of urinary tract disorders topped the list of readmission episodes (43.43%) in Northwest Regional Spinal injuries Centre, Southport, UK . Individuals with spinal cord injury have a lifelong increased risk of systemic infection, which may be associated with episodes of life-threatening bacteraemia.
19161590:2	A retrospective review of positive blood cultures collected over a 32-month period in chronic spinal cord injury patients treated at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre Spinal Cord Injury Unit, Memphis, Tennessee, USA revealed 123 episodes of bacteraemia in 63 patients during 83 hospitalizations . The commonest source of bacteraemia was urinary tract infection (n = 39).
19161590:3	As spinal cord injury patients are at high risk for developing bacteraemia from urine infections, current practice in Southport spinal unit is to administer antibiotics when a spinal cord injury patient develops fever > 38.5° Celsius.
19161590:4	In outpatient clinics, oral antibiotics e.g. trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin or, amoxicillin are prescribed pending results of urine microbiology.
19161590:5	We report a spinal cord injury patient, who attended outpatient clinic with temperature and was prescribed antibiotics with a presumptive diagnosis of urine infection.
19161590:6	Subsequently, full blood count revealed lymphocytosis; therefore, computerised tomography of chest and abdomen was performed.
19161590:7	Enlarged lymph nodes were seen in axillae, mediastinum, abdomen and inguinal regions; the overall picture was suggestive of lymphoma.
19161590:8	However, subsequent blood tests led to a diagnosis of glandular fever, which was a great relief to the patient and his family.
19161590:9	We discuss what we learned from this case.
19161590:10	Case presentation 
A 36-year-old male sustained fracture of first lumbar vertebral body with displacement of bony fragment and dislocation at T12/L1 vertebral body, fracture of left ribs (second to twelfth) and left scapula, sub-capsular splenic tear, and paraplegia at Thoracic 12 level in a road traffic accident in October 2001.
19161590:11	He underwent laparotomy; multiple lacerations to spleen at the level of the hilum both on gastric and parietal aspects were found.
19161590:12	Attempts to salvage the spleen were unsuccessful; therefore, splenectomy was performed.
19161590:13	He received pneumococcal and H. influenza vaccinations, and antibiotic prophylaxis.
19161590:14	He was ventilated in the post-operative period.
19161590:15	Tracheostomy was performed.
19161590:16	Later, surgical fixation of dislocated first lumbar vertebra was carried out.
19161590:17	He was discharged home in July 2002.
19161590:18	This patient attended outpatient clinic on 07 August 2008 with history of feeling rough and temperature.
19161590:19	He was managing neuropathic bladder by intermittent catheterisation.
19161590:20	With a presumptive diagnosis of urine infection, this patient was prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg, twice daily.
19161590:21	Two days later, he developed headache and stomach pain.
19161590:22	Therefore, he stopped ciprofloxacin and started taking trimethoprim instead.
19161590:23	A spinal unit doctor reviewed this patient over telephone on 13 August 2008.
19161590:24	This patient continued to have headache; he had no appetite, he had no energy; he had slight cough; his temperature had been up and down; his tongue was yellow.
19161590:25	He was advised to come to spinal unit for urine and blood tests.
19161590:26	This patient attended spinal unit two days later.
19161590:27	He was still getting headache; he was feeling slightly unwell.
19161590:28	He did not have any symptom pertaining to his chest.
19161590:29	He did not have shortness of breath or haemoptysis.
19161590:30	A sample of urine was sent for microbiology.
19161590:31	X-ray of kidneys and urinary bladder was taken to look for urinary calculi.
19161590:32	This patient was advised to take amoxicillin 500 mg, three times a day.
19161590:33	The attending doctor discussed with the patient that if microbiology report of urine showed growth of bacteria, and if the organism was resistant to amoxicillin, he would require appropriate antibiotic therapy as indicated by microbiology.
19161590:34	This patient was reviewed over telephone three days later.
19161590:35	He continued to feel unwell.
19161590:36	Therefore, he was admitted to spinal unit on the same day.
19161590:37	Indwelling urethral catheter was inserted as a temporary measure.
19161590:38	He was given fluids intravenously.
19161590:39	He was prescribed amoxicillin and gentamicin intravenously.
19161590:40	Urine microbiology showed no growth.
19161590:41	X-ray of kidneys and urinary bladder revealed no radio opaque calculi.
19161590:42	Blood tests of 18 August 2008 showed C-reactive protein of 61.4 mg/L (0.0 – 10.0).
19161590:43	Blood urea: 2.5 mmol/L.
19161590:44	Creatinine: 88 umol/L.
19161590:45	Total bilirubin: 12 umol/L.
19161590:46	Alkaline phosphatase: 125 u/L (40–120).
19161590:47	Alanine aminotrasferase: 61 u/L (5–37).
19161590:48	Gamma glutamyl transferase: 125 u/L (0–50).
19161590:49	International normalised ratio: 1.0.
19161590:50	APTT ratio: 1.20 (0.84 – 1.16).
19161590:51	Calcium: 2.20 mmol/L (2.20 – 2.60).
19161590:52	Phosphate: 1.17 mmol/L (0.80 – 1.50).
19161590:53	Blood culture showed no growth after 72 hours of incubation.
19161590:54	Lactic dehydrogenase: 432 mU/L (0 – 250).
19161590:55	Results of full blood counts are given in Table . Marked lymphocytosis with atypical morphology was seen, which was suggestive of reactive process.
19161590:56	Lymphocyte surface markers were requested for on 26 August 2008.
19161590:57	But this report was received on 02 September 2008.
19161590:58	Computerised tomography of chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed on 21 August 2008.
19161590:59	CT revealed a one cm left anterior axillary node, subcentimetre nodes in both axilla, multiple subcentimetre mediastinal nodes, the largest one measuring 9 mm in the pre-carina.
19161590:60	(Figures and ) In the abdomen, there was a 3 cm × 2 cm soft tissue mass located inferior to the left hemi-diaphragm, which most likely represented lymph nodal mass.
19161590:61	There was a 12 mm node in the aorta-caval region; further subcentimetre nodes were seen in the celiac region around the lesser curvature, paraortic area, and the mesentery.
19161590:62	(Figure ) Lymph nodes were seen in the inguinal region bilaterally measuring 9 mm in the left inguinal area.
19161590:63	The overall picture was suggestive of lymphoma.
19161590:64	There was a 4 cm × 2.5 cm irregular area of low attenuation in segment 7 of the liver.
19161590:65	In order to assess this lesion, CT with contrast was performed the next day.
19161590:66	Computerised tomography with contrast revealed thrombus in the right main lobar branch of pulmonary artery extending into the segmental branch of the lower lobe.
19161590:67	(Figure ) Thrombus was also seen in the segmental branch of right upper lobe, left lower lobe and middle lobe.
19161590:68	No lung parenchymal lesion was seen.
19161590:69	There was a 6 cm × 5 cm lesion in segment 7 of liver.
19161590:70	In the arterial phase, there was peripheral enhancement (Figure ); the lesion became homogenous with the liver parenchyma in delayed phase.
19161590:71	(Figure ) and increased enhancement was seen in the portal venous phase.
19161590:72	(Figure ) This represented a primary liver lesion but lymphomatous metastases could not be excluded entirely.
19161590:73	Therefore, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of abdomen was performed on 26 August 2008.
19161590:74	MRI revealed a lobulated 5 cm × 4.7 cm lesion in segment 7 of liver, which showed high signal on T2 and fat suppressed sequences.
19161590:75	On the post-contrast dynamic sequences, there was peripheral nodular enhancement in the arterial phase with infilling in the portal venous and delayed phases with homogenous enhancement in the late phases.
19161590:76	These findings were in keeping with the diagnosis of haemangioma.
19161590:77	The nodes noted on previous CT examination in the portal caval (12 mm), para-aortic (subcentimetre), and left hemidiaphragmatic nodes (3 cm) were still present.
19161590:78	The radiologist expressed the opinion that lymphoma should be considered.
19161590:79	On 02 September 2008, lymphocyte cell marker showed an excess of large granular lymphocytes and activated lymphocytes.
19161590:80	The Glandular Fever Slide Test was positive.
19161590:81	There were changes of hyposplenism.
19161590:82	On 05 September 2008, Paul Bunnell test was done, which was also positive.
19161590:83	Antibiotic was omitted.
19161590:84	He was prescribed enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously for pulmonary artery thrombosis.
19161590:85	Epstein Barr VCA IgG was positive; Epstein Barr VCA IgM was positive.
19161590:86	These results were consistent with recent Epstein Barr virus infection.
19161590:87	On review of the imaging studies by a senior doctor, hepatic lesion could have been diagnosed as haemangioma by the computerised tomography performed with contrast; MRI scan was perhaps not required.
19161590:88	Further, the soft tissue mass located under left hemidiaphragm, which was initially reported as lymph nodes, represented splenunculus.
19161590:89	(Figures and ) The mass received blood supply from splenic artery and venous drainage was by splenic vein.
19161590:90	Discussion 
This patient was prescribed ciprofloxacin, followed by trimethoprim, amoxicillin and gentamicin, as he continued to have temperature.
19161590:91	Routine administration of antibiotic to a spinal cord injury patient, who has developed pyrexia, may be acceptable in outpatient setting.
19161590:92	But, when a patient does not respond promptly to antibacterial therapy, spinal cord physician should consider other possibilities such as infection by multi-drug resistant organism, viral infection, venous, or arterial thrombosis.
19161590:93	In a patient with fever and lymphocytosis, examination of blood film is often a very useful diagnostic aid.
19161590:94	Presence of atypical lymphocyte with characteristic features (it is unusually large; it has a scalloped edge where it is indented by erythrocytes; and its cytoplasm is stained dark blue at the edge of the cell) indicates that glandular fever is a likely diagnosis  and needs further tests for confirmation.
19161590:95	When the initial report of full blood count showed lymphocytosis comprising > 50% of white blood cells, the spinal cord physician should have requested for examination of a blood film.
19161590:96	Then, infectious mononucleosis would have been suspected.
19161590:97	Abdominal imaging studies (CT chest, abdomen and pelvis, CT with contrast, MRI with contrast) could have been avoided.
19161590:98	In this patient, findings of enlarged lymph nodes in abdomen, mediastinum, axillae and inguinal regions were interpreted as "overall picture suggestive of lymphoma".
19161590:99	As this patient had lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, we should have considered the possibility of glandular fever.
19161590:100	The diagnosis of lymphoma caused considerable anxiety to the patient and his family.
19161590:101	Infectious mononucleosis is usually a self-limited clinical syndrome caused primarily by Epstein-Barr virus infection.
19161590:102	The gross changes, which were observed during autopsies of nine patients with infectious mononucleosis, were almost exclusively confined to enlargement of lymphoid tissues . Nasopharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia was constant, in one instance, suggesting tumour.
19161590:103	Lymph nodes were usually but not invariably enlarged.
19161590:104	Lymphoid hyperplasia may involve visceral organs as well.
19161590:105	Zhang and Molot  described an unusual case of acute Epstein-Barr virus infection-associated gastritis with diffuse atypical lymphoid hyperplasia in gastric mucosa.
19161590:106	The classic criteria for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis developed by Hoagland include a lymphocytosis comprising ≥ 50% of the white blood cell differential with atypical lymphocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the total white blood cell count.
19161590:107	Modern haematology analysers are efficient in identifying heterophile-positive patients.
19161590:108	Automatic analysers detect quantitative as well as qualitative abnormalities in lymphocytes.
19161590:109	Using a combination of all qualitative and quantitative flags, Coulter STKS and Sysmex NE-8000 analysers identified 156 (86.2%) of 181 heterophile-positive cases . 
This patient had thrombosis involving both pulmonary arteries.
19161590:110	Acute Epstein Barr virus infection is associated with transient induction of anti-phospholipid antibodies . In this patient APTT ratio was high; therefore, it is likely that Epstein Barr virus-induced anti-phospholipid antibodies may have played a role in the genesis of pulmonary artery thrombosis.
19161590:111	The 3 cm × 2 cm soft tissue mass, located inferior to left hemidiaphragm was reported initially as lymph node in this patient, who had undergone splenectomy; we failed to suspect splenunculus.
19161590:112	Review of CT scan by a senior doctor showed that the mass received its blood supply from splenic artery, and venous drainage was by splenic vein, thus confirming presence of splenic tissue.
19161590:113	A diagnosis of splenunculus was reassuring to the patient, as it averted the need for biopsy to exclude neoplastic lesions.
19161590:114	Scintigraphy is also useful in detecting splenunculus, Denatured blood cell scintigraphy is considered more sensitive than 99 m Technetium sulphur colloid scintigraphy, and allows imaging of the splenic tissue independent of the liver.
19161590:115	Conclusion 
1.
19161590:116	This case is a reminder that sometimes pyrexia in a spinal cord injury patient may be due to causes other than bacterial infection.
19161590:117	2.
19161590:118	When full blood count shows lymphocytosis (comprising > 50% of white blood cells) with atypical morphology, lymphocyte surface markers, Paul Bunnell test, and Epstein Barr virus serology should be performed.
19161590:119	In this patient, these tests would have led to a diagnosis of glandular fever.
19161590:120	Then abdominal imaging studies could have been avoided.
19161590:121	3.
19161590:122	Lymphoid hyperplasia is the hallmark of infectious mononucleosis; therefore, presence of enlarged lymph nodes in abdomen, mediastinum, axillae and inguinal regions, as seen in CT scan, should have prompted a diagnosis of glandular fever in this patient, who had lymphocytosis with atypical morphology.
19161590:123	4. CT of abdomen revealed a soft tissue mass inferior to left hemidiaphragm in this asplenic patient, which was misinterpreted as lymph nodes, whereas the mass represented splenunculus; review of CT revealed that the blood supply was from splenic artery and venous drainage was by splenic vein.
19161590:124	5.
19161590:125	Acute infection with Epstein Barr virus may lead to transient induction of anti-phospholipid antibodies, which can cause vascular thrombosis.
19161590:126	6.
19161590:127	This case illustrates the value of reviewing test results and discussion with senior doctors, as these measures help to recognize medical errors and improve patient care.

Klemenc-Ketis and colleagues' novel report of hypercapnia and hypokalemia associated with near-death experiences (NDEs)  was somewhat surprising, as Sabom  had previously reported lower than normal carbon dioxide levels measured at the time of a patient's NDE, and Parnia and colleagues, in a prospective study of 63 cardiac arrest survivors, had found no significant association of either potassium or carbon dioxide with NDEs . 
Klemenc-Ketis and colleagues' conclusion that hypercapnia plays a role in provoking NDEs is one possible interpretation of the correlation they found
20519028:1	It is also plausible that hypercapnia is simply an indicator of another factor that may be linked causally to NDE reports.
20519028:2	For example, the authors noted that hypercapnia indicates better cardiac output and perfusion pressure, which would reduce the amnesia that is usually seen in cardiac arrest, so that patients would be more likely to remember what happened during the arrest.
20519028:3	The association between NDEs and hypercapnia may thus indicate simply that patients who are able to recall more of their cardiac arrest also report more NDEs.
20519028:4	Gliksman and Kellehear reviewed studies showing that levels of carbon dioxide in the blood are not necessarily accurate estimates of levels in the brain , which further complicates the interpretation of the current findings.
20519028:5	The small sample size of this study, the contradictory evidence from other studies, and the unclear association between levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and in the brain suggest caution in interpreting the findings and suggest the need for further research.
20519028:6	Authors' response 
Zalika Klemenc-Ketis, Janko Kersnik and Stefek Grmec 
Bruce Greyson proposes an alternative explanation for the results of our study , which can also be plausible.
20519028:7	Namely, higher levels of the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (petCO 2) are also indicators of better cardiac output, as discussed in our article  and confirmed in our previous studies . Higher incidence of reported NDEs in patients with hypercapnia might therefore indicate simply better memory of the actual NDE event, but this should be confirmed with further studies.
20519028:8	A study about the effects of meditation on respiration and temporal lobes indicated that higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), which is a result of special breathing tech niques during meditation, might have been important in provoking cognitive and emotional changes .
20519028:9	Also, higher levels of pCO 2 presumably have an excitatory effect on the limbic system, which might result in mystical (NDE-like) experiences . The possible connection between the limbic system and NDE-like experiences has already been reported . 
Higher petCO 2 and pCO 2, besides better cardiac output, might therefore indicate also a possible connection between carbon dioxide and the incidence of NDEs.
20519028:10	Since patients with asphyxia cardiac arrest were found to have higher petCO 2 than patients with primary cardiac arrest , the patients with asphyxia cardiac arrest might also have higher incidence of NDEs - which, if confirmed, might help to clarify the role of carbon dioxide in NDEs.
20519028:11	This theory should be further investigated in larger and multicentre studies, but in the light of patient-oriented care it is important to take into account the existence of NDEs in cardiac arrest patients and to develop protocols of care for such patients.
20519028:12	Abbreviations 
NDE: near-death experience; pCO 2: partial pressure of carbon dioxide; petCO 2: partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide.

12533287:0	Methods 
A questionnaire was sent by e-mail to the project leaders of the 13 participant institutions (from 10 countries) in the Foodborne Viruses in Europe group.
12533287:1	The questionnaire, administered in English, was developed and completed in collaboration with research and medical virologists and epidemiologists working in viral gastroenteritis surveillance.
12533287:2	General information on surveillance systems (including sources of data, estimate of national population under surveillance, definition of a viral gastroenteritis outbreak, and number of such outbreaks investigated) was collected for the period 1995–2000.
12533287:3	More detailed epidemiologic data (setting, mode of transmission, and implicated food vehicles) were collected from outbreaks that occurred in 2000.
12533287:4	Contributors were sent a summary report and asked to confirm that the data presented accurately represented their surveillance.
12533287:5	Results 
Discussion 
Viral gastroenteritis infection, typically a self-limiting condition of short duration in humans, is extremely common and associated with relatively low deaths.
12533287:6	Surveillance of outbreaks of this infection, rather than individual cases, may be more appropriate.
12533287:7	In our review of the surveillance for this infection in Europe, we found variations in the organizations conducting surveillance, the surveillance definition of a viral gastroenteritis outbreak, the populations under surveillance, and the completeness of descriptive and analytical epidemiologic and diagnostic information.
12533287:8	Researchers comparing surveillance information at an international level should consider the outputs of surveillance, as well as the influence of methodology and structure of surveillance on these outputs.
12533287:9	Surveillance for viral gastroenteritis in Europe is poorly developed; systems vary in their sources of data, definitions, and use of diagnostic techniques.
12533287:10	These differences are reflected in the wide range of numbers of outbreaks, population-based rates, and epidemiologic patterns observed across Europe.
12533287:11	Nonetheless, our comparison of this surveillance data was an informative exercise because international epidemiologic databases of viral gastroenteritis infections have not been developed.
12533287:12	In many of the countries included in the Foodborne Viruses in Europe network, viral gastroenteritis has not been considered a priority, and these countries do not have a well-developed surveillance system.
12533287:13	This inventory of surveillance data will aid in the development of a more consistent and complete surveillance across Europe.
12533287:14	These data clearly show that both the absolute number and the population-based rates of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks differ substantially between European surveillance systems.
12533287:15	From 1995 to 2000, 1,643 outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis were investigated by the Public Health Laboratory Service in England and Wales, but the outbreak rates (number of outbreaks/population) were highest in Sweden for every surveyed year.
12533287:16	Some variation in these figures occurred because a number of the surveillance systems required laboratory confirmation while others did not.
12533287:17	However, the criteria suggested by Kaplan et al. to recognize an outbreak of viral etiology is widely used and is generally accepted as an effective clinical tool in the absence of diagnostic information.
12533287:18	Interestingly, surveillance systems with the most stringent outbreak criteria, including laboratory confirmation of outbreaks (England and Wales, Finland, and Sweden) ascertained the most outbreaks, likely because surveillance in these countries is more developed and integrated better with reporting bodies.
12533287:19	However, even the surveillance systems with the highest figures greatly underascertain viral gastroenteritis.
12533287:20	A study of infectious intestinal disease in England and Wales estimated that only 1/300–1,500 cases of Norovirus gastroenteritis are reported to national surveillance.
12533287:21	For a case to be ascertained by national surveillance, patients must be examined by their primary-care doctor, a specimen must be taken and submitted for laboratory testing, the test must be positive (the amount of false negatives will depend on the diagnostic technique), and the surveillance unit must be notified.
12533287:22	Ascertaining outbreaks requires an additional step in which investigators must recognize epidemiologic links between cases.
12533287:23	While this chain of events will differ from country to country, the principle of underascertainment affects all surveillance.
12533287:24	However, outbreak recognition and investigation will, through case finding, lead to better ascertainment of persons affected in outbreaks.
12533287:25	Although most surveillance systems may be designed for national coverage, reports were incomplete to a varying degree.
12533287:26	Ascertained outbreaks varied geographically and were incomplete, as demonstrated by the large variation in reported outbreaks.
12533287:27	This survey found that the great majority of European viral outbreaks could be attributed to Norovirus . In Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, France, and Sweden, >95% of nonbacterial outbreaks were attributed to noroviruses as were 84% of outbreaks in the Netherlands.
12533287:28	The relative number of infections from noroviruses was lower in Slovenia (43%) and Spain (57%), although these estimates are based on a small number of outbreaks (n=14 for both).
12533287:29	These figures are consistent with previous reports that Norovirus could be detected in 91% of all nonbacterial infectious intestinal disease outbreaks in the Netherlands and 89% of such outbreaks in Sweden.
12533287:30	Similarly, Fankhauser et al. found Norovirus responsible for 96% of nonbacterial outbreaks in the United States.
12533287:31	Estimates of the importance of foodborne transmission also varied widely in this survey.
12533287:32	Foods were implicated as the vehicle of transmission in 16 (94%) of 17 outbreaks in Denmark and 28 (100%) of 28 outbreaks in France because surveillance systems in these countries were designed to detect foodborne disease.
12533287:33	In countries with more general outbreak data, estimates of foodborne transmission were lower: 7 (17%) of 41 in the Netherlands, 14 (24%) of 58 in Finland, and 20 (7%) of 290 in England and Wales, although laboratory and statistical evidence of association with food or water was scant.
12533287:34	The settings of outbreaks also reflected the proportion of reported outbreaks that were ascertained to be foodborne.
12533287:35	For example, in Denmark, 75% of all reported outbreaks were set in food outlets.
12533287:36	In Spain, the Netherlands, and England and Wales, most reported outbreaks occurred in residential homes and hospitals, with only a small fraction occurring in food outlets.
12533287:37	In Finland, the National Public Health Laboratory is the only facility in the country testing for Norovirus and, therefore, is aware of all such investigations.
12533287:38	Most other surveillance systems receive data on outbreaks from a number of sources including local public health authorities, other diagnostic laboratories, and physicians.
12533287:39	Surveillance in Denmark is anomalous in that only outbreaks from the national food inspection service are reported, which, in conjunction with the special mention of shellfish in the definition of an outbreak, explains the preponderance of food-related outbreaks in Danish surveillance.
12533287:40	Such diversity in data sources and definitions may also explain the differences in estimates among other countries, including those external to the Foodborne Viruses in Europe network.
12533287:41	Based on data from 90 outbreaks, Fankhauser et al. estimated that 47% of Norovirus outbreaks in the United States were spread by food.
12533287:42	This estimate, derived from local and state health department reports, may be affected by reporting bias or may truly reflect different epidemiologic patterns of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks compared to those seen in European countries.
12533287:43	Factors that might affect the relative amount of foodborne transmission of Norovirus are the virologic quality of food, food-handling guidelines, and infection control practice in health-care settings.
12533287:44	DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, used to characterize outbreak strains by laboratories in England and Wales, Finland, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, yields the most virologic information, although this technique is a labor-intensive procedure.
12533287:45	The heteroduplex mobility assay, as well as an EIA based on one of the Norovirus genotypes (Grimsby virus), was used by the laboratory in England and Wales.
12533287:46	Reverse line blot was used in the Netherlands and Spain in 2000 and has since been adopted by a number of the other collaborating institutes to characterize Norovirus . The use of the heteroduplex mobility assay, reverse line blot, and sequencing to characterize virus has demonstrated the considerable and dynamic genetic diversity of human Caliciviridae.
12533287:47	The use of such techniques by a wider group may demonstrate important differences in molecular epidemiology between countries and may detect the introduction of a novel strain to an area by tracking and linking outbreaks over wide geographic areas.
12533287:48	In the retrospective survey presented here, determining whether differences in frequency, setting, and importance of foodborne transmission are real or artifacts caused by international variation in surveillance system design was difficult.
12533287:49	Timely collection of information for case-control or cohort studies and development of tests for virus detection in food are needed to advance understanding of the extent of foodborne transmission of Norovirus . Success of the Foodborne Viruses in Europe network will depend on the ability to compare both virologic and epidemiologic data.
12533287:50	Protocols for harmonizing the characterization of noroviruses and an outbreak questionnaire with a minimum dataset have been defined.
12533287:51	While data collection will be harmonized, information will be obtained from an international group whose range of perspectives will yield different interpretations of epidemiologic events.
12533287:52	The timely feedback of surveillance data to participants is an essential step in the cycle of continued improvement of a surveillance system that we have made possible through this European Union–funded network.
12533287:53	In addition to describing the current state of viral gastroenteritis surveillance in Europe, this report will act as a baseline to interpret prospective outcomes of the Foodborne Viruses in Europe network.

Results and discussion 
Carrier-mediated drug delivery offers a number of design opportunities to tailor a delivery route around the details of particular drugs, including their modes of action and potential side effects.
20957168:1	Such carrier functions can be quite diverse, including transport to the targeted tissue, control of intracellular distribution, and protection against degradation or elimination by the mononuclear phagocytic systems (MPS).
20957168:2	For instance, it has been demonstrated that Paclitaxel nanoparticles have a long time release accompanied with a small size which is so important for phagocytic systems.
20957168:3	– Also preparing NPs of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cisplatin, indomethacin, iboprufen, and so many other drugs has shown that these carriers can deliver the drug to the tissue in the best way with the least side effects and a long time circulation in the body.
20957168:4	, All these features prompted us to investigate the possibility of developing these nanoparticles as a controlled release drug formulation.
20957168:5	In the development of new colloidal structures as circulating carriers, the assessment of their performance as drug carriers necessarily comprises the knowledge of the loaded amount of drug, its physical state and distribution inside the carrier, as well as its release kinetics and the influence of environmental factors on it.
20957168:6	In our previous study, PLGA-loaded 9-NC nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation method and four different independent variables on the characteristics of nanoparticles were evaluated.
20957168:7	The results of optimized formulations showed a narrow size distribution with a polydispersity index of 0.01%, an average diameter of 207 ± 26 nm, and a drug loading of more than 30%.
20957168:8	The in vitro drug release profile showed a sustained 9-NC release up to 160 hours indicating the controlled release of 9-NC via nanoparticles.
20957168:9	But, since PLGA nanoparticles can be uptaken by phagocytic systems easily and have a rapid initial release (15%–20% in first 5 hours), in this study, we used PLGA-PEG for preparing nanoparticles and characterized them to be taken to the next phase of study like cytotoxicity and in vivo studies.
20957168:10	Conclusion 
In this investigation, PLGA-PEG nanoparticles loaded with 9-NC (a novel potent anticancer drug) were prepared by nanoprecipitation, and the physicochemical characteristics included an investigation of their properties, such as drug loading, morphology, size, and thermal behavior were evaluated and compared with the results of our previous study, in which these NPs were prepared using PLGA polymer instead of PLGA-PEG copolymer.
20957168:11	The images of SEM indicated the optimized NPs were spherical in shape without any aggregation or adhesion.
20957168:12	More detailed studies showed that the particle size of NPs through using PLGA-PEG is smaller than PLGA samples.
20957168:13	Drug loading was much higher than the previous study, and the initial release was slower.
20957168:14	But as mentioned above the total release was faster than PLGA NPs, which can be explained by the hydrophilic characteristic of PLGA-PEG copolymer.
20957168:15	This point causes a rapid release compared with PLGA that is a lipophil polymer and can keep the drug longer than PLGA-PEG copolymer.
20957168:16	Overall physical evaluation comparison shows that PLGA-PEG nanoparticles can be a promising controlled release delivery system of lipophilic drugs like 9-NC specially in cancer therapies which need an acute and target treatment during therapeutically period.
20957168:17	However, the in vivo behavior of drug release, the speed of clearance, and final biodistribution of nanoparticles also need to be confirmed in future studies.

20462448:0	Background 
About 150,000 total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgeries are performed each year in the United States . This is the most common surgical treatment for hip osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which may begin as a complex mechano-chemical degenerative cascade . Subsequent revision hip arthroplasty may be necessitated by component dislocation, protrusion, malalignment, wear, fracture, loosening, sepsis, and/or osteolysis of the original implant . 
During revision hip surgery, the primary hip implant is removed, and the femoral canal is reamed to a deeper point to receive the longer stems of a revision hip implant, which sometimes compensates successfully for bone loss due to surgery, trauma, or pathology.
20462448:1	Bone grafts may also be used to augment bone during revision.
20462448:2	The aim of revision surgery is to relieve pain and restore proper hip function.
20462448:3	A challenge faced by surgeons in revision arthroplasty is adequate fixation of the new implant because of the loss of femoral bone stock incurred due to initial trauma, primary hip implant surgery, or pathology.
20462448:4	Revision hip stems are usually constructed of a single piece of titanium or cobalt-chrome alloy onto which a spherical femoral head is subsequently mounted.
20462448:5	New modular stem implants have been recently developed consisting of perfectly interlocking proximal and distal components [ - ].
20462448:6	The Zimmer Modular Revision Hip System (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) has been assessed clinically and radiographically with good results with respect to pain, stiffness, function, and subsidence, with few complications related to dislocation, infection, and intra-operative femur fracture, albeit for short follow-up times of 2 to 5 years . No study to date has quantitatively assessed this implant for mechanical behavior.
20462448:7	The present aim was to compare the mechanical characteristics of two revision hip stems, namely, an interlocking two-piece Modular hip implant versus a traditional-type single-piece Monoblock hip implant.
20462448:8	A finite element (FE) model of both hip stems was developed to assess strain and stress distribution under sub-clinical static axial loads and compared to mechanical tests.
20462448:9	Present results may provide preliminary information to clinicians in deciding whether modular or single-piece devices are preferred for a specific patient group.

Discussion 
Conclusions 
This is the first report of the biomechanical characteristics of these particular two-piece Modular and single-piece Monoblock revision hip implants.
20462448:11	The FE model of the hip implant alone (Construct A) was predictive of experimental strains at all locations on the Modular device, but only for the proximal portion in the Monoblock device.
20462448:12	Significant differences in FE strains of the two prostheses implanted in an FE femur model (Construct B) signified a greater amount of stress absorption by the Modular implant than in the Monoblock, suggesting that the host femur may carry more of the load when the Monoblock device is employed.
20462448:13	A stress concentration on the Modular implant occurred at the modular junction, which may be susceptible to failure; however, no comparable potential failure points were identified on the Monoblock prosthesis.
20462448:14	Experiments on Construct A showed that the Modular device was 3 to 4.5 times mechanically stiffer than the Monoblock.

20548938:0	INTRODUCTION 
Cancer is a major public health problem in both developed and developing countries.
20548938:1	It was estimated that there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons living with cancer around the world in 2002.
20548938:2	In the US, cancer is the second leading cause of death, where one in four deaths is due to cancer.
20548938:3	Since 1990, there has been a 22% increase in cancer incidence and mortality with the four most frequent cancers being lung, breast, colorectal, and stomach.
20548938:4	Medicinal plants have played important roles in the last five decades in the treatment of cancer and most new clinical applications of plant secondary metabolites and their derivatives have been applied towards combating cancer.
20548938:5	Ageratum conyzoides L. belongs to the family and tribe of Asteraceae and Eupatoriae, respectively.
20548938:6	It is native to Central America, Caribbean, Florida (USA), Southeast Asia, South China, India, Nigeria, Australia, and South America.
20548938:7	It is traditionally called “ufu opioko” and “otogo” by the Igedes in Benue state, Nigeria.
20548938:8	In Southwestern Nigeria, it is known as “Imí esú”.
20548938:9	A.
20548938:10	conyzoides has been used in folklore for the treatment of fever, pneumonia, cold, rheumatism, spasm, headache, and curing wounds.
20548938:11	Its gastroprotective, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antianalgesic, antipyretic, anticoccidial, and anticonvulsant properties have been reported.
20548938:12	However, to the best of our knowledge, the in vitro anticancer activity of this plant has never been evaluated and published.
20548938:13	Natural products from plants can be another potent source for the discovery of anticancer and antioxidant agents.
20548938:14	In this article, we describe the in vitro anticancer activity of ethanol, petroleum ether, ethylacetate, butanol, and water extracts of A.
20548938:15	conyzoides against some cancer cell lines: Human non-small cell lung (A-549), human gastric (SGC-7901), human colon (HT-29), human golima (U-251), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), human prostate carcinoma (DU-145), human hepatic carcinoma (BEL-7402), and mouse leukemia (P-388) cancer cell lines as well as the antiradical activity of the aforementioned extracts using the DPPH method.
20548938:16	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Cancer is one of the most widespread diseases in humans and there is considerable scientific and commercial interest in the continuing discovery of new anticancer agents from natural product sources.
20548938:17	Currently, over 50% of drugs used in clinical trials for anticancer activity were isolated from natural sources or are related to them.
20548938:18	A number of active compounds have been shown to possess anticancer activity; these include flavonoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and alkaloids.
20548938:19	Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cancer-preventive effects of plants.
20548938:20	These include inhibition of mutagenesis by inhibiting the metabolism, inhibition of DNA adduct formation, free-radical scavenging, and effects on cell proliferation and tumor growth.
20548938:21	In the present study, the petroleum ether and ethylacetate extracts of ethanolic extract of A.
20548938:22	conyzoides showed inhibitory activity on a wide range of cancer cell lines with ethylacetate extract having the greatest activity.
20548938:23	It could therefore be deduced that the ethylacetate and petroleum ether extracts of A.
20548938:24	conyzoides possess anticancer properties.
20548938:25	Flavonoids have been implicated as responsible for the anticancer activities of some medicinal plants.
20548938:26	The study of showed that the flavonoids cis -2,5,7-trihydroxyflavanonol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and chrysin-6-C-β-D-glucopyranosyl-8-C-α-L-arabinopyranoside exhibited significant cytotoxicity activity on A-549 and BGC-823 cancer cell lines.
20548938:27	Thus, flavonoids may be responsible for the anticancer activity of A.
20548938:28	conyzoides . Studies conducted by reported a high correlation between DPPH radical scavenging potential and total phenolic content.
20548938:29	Kaempferol (3,5,7,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone) is one of the most commonly found dietary flavonols.
20548938:30	Kaempferol has also been found to be a blocker of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by low K +-induced apoptosis in cerebella granule cells.
20548938:31	According to previous reports, antioxidant activity of kaempferol was believed to have cytoprotective function against oxidative stress.
20548938:32	It seemed to suggest that kaempferol may not only protect cells from free radical damage via antioxidant effect, but also induce apoptotic cell death, via pro-oxidant activity, in malignant cell lines and to inhibit tumorigenesis.
20548938:33	The antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer activity, and HIV protease inhibitory activity of kaempferol have also been reported.
20548938:34	The result of the present investigation showed that A. conyzoides possesses antiradical activity and the property resides on the ethyl acetate extract.
20548938:35	Kaempferol, which was isolated from this extract, was found to scavenge DPPH radical.
20548938:36	It could therefore be deduced that the bioactive compound responsible for the antiradical activity of A.
20548938:37	conyzoides is 3,5,7,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone (kaempferol).
20548938:38	Further research is needed to unravel the specific bioactive compounds responsible for the anticancer properties of the extracts of A.
20548938:39	conyzoides . In conclusion, the study has not only established the anticancer property of the extracts of A.
20548938:40	conyzoides but also its antioxidant activity.
20548938:41	Thus, the plant could be employed in ethno-medicine for the management of cancerous diseases.
20158969:0	Introduction 
Chronic and disabling conditions cause activity limitations for more than 10% of Americans, or 25 million people.
20158969:1	As the US population ages, this number will increase, resulting in higher demands for both formal and informal caregivers ( - ).
20158969:2	In 2003, the National Survey of Families and Households in the United States reported that 33% of respondents (n = 7,277) gave help or assistance to friends or family living outside their home, up from 16% in 1996.
20158969:3	These caregivers, in addition to those helping friends or family in the home, represent an increasing number of informal caregivers who provide ongoing unpaid help or support to someone with a disability or long-term health condition.
20158969:4	Formal caregivers, or those who provide paid help, constitute only 15% to 20% of all caregivers.
20158969:5	In recent years, considerable effort has been made to describe the population of informal caregivers and examine the positive and negative consequences of caregiving ( - ).
20158969:6	Positive outcomes of caregiving include personal growth, strengthening of the relationship between caregivers and care recipients, feelings of satisfaction, and increased self-esteem.
20158969:7	Negative consequences of caregiving may be physical, financial, psychological, or social in nature ( , ).
20158969:8	Specifically, these consequences may include isolation, increased responsibilities, loss of employment, depression, decline in physical health, financial strain, feelings of burden, and stress ( , ).
20158969:9	The outcomes of stress and burden are central features of most caregiving models.
20158969:10	An aspect of caregiving that has received little attention is the degree to which the choice (or lack thereof) to provide care affects a caregiver's emotional well-being.
20158969:11	The selection of a recipient's primary caregiver is often a complicated and multifaceted process.
20158969:12	Not all caregivers choose to be caregivers.
20158969:13	Prospective caregivers are sometimes forced into caregiving roles by social obligation or by economic pressures.
20158969:14	Caregivers who are reluctant to provide care are less likely to learn new skills or be effective caregivers.
20158969:15	These caregivers also feel burdened and are more likely to be depressed ( - ).
20158969:16	Caregiving often is conceptualized using a stress-coping model in which the care recipient's health and functional ability are presumed to decline over time, a process that is stressful for both the caregiver and care recipient.
20158969:17	Differentiating the concepts of burden and stress is important.
20158969:18	Stress is generally measured through self-report as a subjective variable, and it may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors (eg, smoking) or may directly affect health negatively by blunting immune response.
20158969:19	Caregiver burden encompasses a range of subjective emotions and objective events that influence a caregiver as a result of providing care.
20158969:20	One way to quantify burden is to objectively measure the number of hours and type of care provided by the caregiver.
20158969:21	Asking about and understanding the outcome of choice in caregiving was an explicit directive from a national stakeholders' meeting that preceded the survey used in our study.
20158969:22	We used the stress-coping model as a basis for our research, considering caregiving to be a chronic and significant stressor, and we conceptualized how people choose to become caregivers on the basis of previous research.
20158969:23	Multiple motives influence the choice to provide care, including factors involving the caregiver (eg, duty, financial dependence, tradition, desire to avoid institutionalization), care recipient (eg, health status, resistance to institutional care), and family and community (eg, availability of alternative caregivers, financial and social resources).
20158969:24	Our objectives were to compare a population sample of caregivers who reported having a choice in caring to those who did not and determine how choice affects an informal caregiver's self-reported stress.
20158969:25	We hypothesized that caregivers who perceive their role as one they did not choose feel stress as a result.
20158969:26	Methods 
Between May and August of 2005, a 10-question caregiving module was added to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey for community-dwelling residents of North Carolina.
20158969:27	Respondents were identified as informal caregivers if they answered yes to the question, "People may provide regular care or assistance to someone with a long-term illness or disability.
20158969:28	During the past month, did you provide any such care or assistance to a family member or friend?" Of 5,859 adults who completed the module, 895 (15.4% weighted) were identified as informal caregivers.
20158969:29	These caregivers were then asked if they would be willing to participate in a 20-minute follow-back telephone interview, and 77% agreed.
20158969:30	Of the participants who agreed, 401 were successfully contacted and completed the follow-back interview.
20158969:31	Perceived choice in caregiving was classified by a single question: "Do you feel you had a choice in taking on this responsibility of caring for him/her [the recipient]?" Our analysis was restricted to those caring for people aged ≥18 years because the meaning of choice may be different when considering adults and children (excluded n = 19).
20158969:32	Respondents who did not answer the question on choice (n = 37) or on stress (n = 28) were also excluded, and many participants (n = 24) answered neither question.
20158969:33	A total of 341 caregivers were included in our analyses.
20158969:34	The outcome of interest, stress resulting from caregiving, was measured by using the question "Using the same scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all stressful and 5 is very stressful, how emotionally stressful would you say that caring for your [recipient] is for you?" On the basis of the skewed response distribution, we established stress as a binomial variable: participants who answered 1 or 2 were classified as "not stressed," and participants who answered 3, 4, or 5 were classified as "stressed."
20158969:35	Other BRFSS variables included caregiver age, sex, income, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, and self-reported health status.
20158969:36	BRFSS caregiver module questions provided additional descriptive variables, including the care recipient's age, the relationship of the caregiver to the care recipient, the length of time that the caregiver had provided care, and the number of hours of care provided in an average week.
20158969:37	In the follow-back interview, caregivers also self-reported if they were primary, secondary, or equal co-caregivers.
20158969:38	In the follow-back interview, the type of care provided by the caregiver to the recipient was assessed by using indices of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
20158969:39	ADLs were measured as activities related to personal care and include bathing or showering, dressing, getting in or out of bed or a chair, using the toilet, and eating.
20158969:40	IADLs were activities related to independent living, including preparing meals, managing money, shopping for groceries or personal items, performing light or heavy housework, and using a telephone.
20158969:41	Caregiver burden was measured according to the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) scale, which is composed of 2 elements: hours per week spent providing care and the type of care (ADLs and IADLs) provided.
20158969:42	Thus, this measure of burden is only objective.
20158969:43	A detailed explanation of burden score calculation can be found in appendix A of the 2004 NAC report Caregiving in the US.
20158969:44	Level 1 burden represents the least intense level of caregiving burden, and level 5 represents the most intense level.
20158969:45	Each of the 341 participants' responses was weighted in a 2-step process to represent the population of North Carolina in 2005.
20158969:46	First, the BRFSS sample was weighted to represent North Carolina, adjusting for response and the 4-month interview period.
20158969:47	Second, the sample who completed the follow-back interview was weighted to account for differences compared with the full BRFSS sample of caregivers.
20158969:48	We used descriptive analysis to compare the demographic characteristics of caregivers who reported that they had a choice in caring with caregivers who reported no choice in caring.
20158969:49	We assessed potential confounders by using binomial logistic regression to assess each variable's crude association (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) with stress.
20158969:50	Using these results, 3 binomial logistic regression models were created to describe the relationship between choice in caring and the caregiver's corresponding emotional stress.
20158969:51	The caregiver's general health (dichotomized as excellent, very good, or good vs fair or poor) was not significantly related to stress and was not included the models.
20158969:52	Model 1 represents the crude relationship between caregiver choice and caregiver stress.
20158969:53	Model 2 was adjusted for the caregiver's age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, 5-level measure of burden, and length of time spent caring for the recipient.
20158969:54	Model 3 included all variables in model 2 plus caregiver's status and relationship to the recipient.
20158969:55	All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 14.0 Complex Samples statistical software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois) to account for the sampling design of the BRFSS and follow-back interview.
20158969:56	Significance was set at α = .05.
20158969:57	Results 
Slightly more than half of participants of the follow-back interview (183 of 341, 54%) felt that they had a choice in caring for the recipient.
20158969:58	Overall, caregivers who had a choice in caring reported experiencing significantly less stress (38%) than caregivers who did not have a choice in caring (71%, P < .001).
20158969:59	The mean age of caregivers who had a choice in providing care (46 years) did not differ significantly from the age of caregivers who did not have a choice in providing care (50 years); the same was true for mean age of care recipients (71 years for caregivers with a choice vs 70 years for caregivers with no choice).
20158969:60	Most caregivers in both groups were female, non-Hispanic white, and married; most care recipients in both groups were also female.
20158969:61	Distributions of income, education status, and health status were similar between both groups of caregivers.
20158969:62	Most caregivers reported being secondary caregivers.
20158969:63	The relationship of the caregiver to the recipient differed significantly in some cases, depending on caregiver choice.
20158969:64	Caregivers with a choice were most frequently categorized as "other family member" (ie, recipients are relatives but not parents or children, 50%), and caregivers without a choice most frequently reported being a child of the recipient (45%, P < .001).
20158969:65	Caregivers with a choice were significantly more likely to be a nonfamily member of the care recipient (16%) than caregivers without a choice (2%, P < .001).
20158969:66	Overall, caregivers with a choice reported lower levels of burden than caregivers with no choice in caring.
20158969:67	Caregivers with a choice were most often categorized as burden level 3 (34%), and caregivers without a choice were most often categorized as burden level 4 (36%, P = .04).
20158969:68	Slightly more than 14% of caregivers without a choice reported experiencing the highest level of burden compared with only 5% of caregivers who had a choice.
20158969:69	Total length of care was similar between the 2 groups of caregivers.
20158969:70	The number of hours of care provided by the caregivers per week and the mean ADL and IADL scores did not differ significantly between caregivers with a choice and caregivers without a choice.
20158969:71	All 3 binomial logistic regression models showed a significant positive relationship between lack of choice in caring and self-reported caregiver stress; the association decreased with the addition of variables.
20158969:72	In the unadjusted model (model 1), caregivers who did not have a choice in providing care to the recipient were nearly 4 times as likely to report stress than caregivers with a choice.
20158969:73	When adjusting for a caregiver's age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, level of burden, and total length of care (model 2), caregivers without a choice were still 3.5 times as likely to report stress as caregivers with a choice.
20158969:74	Model 2 also demonstrated a dose response for burden levels (burden level 3, OR = 3.2; burden level 4, OR = 5.2).
20158969:75	In the fully adjusted model, caregivers without a choice were 3.1 times as likely to report stress as caregivers with a choice in caring.
20158969:76	As in model 2, high burden levels, particularly level 4 (OR = 4.5), were associated with an increase in self-reported stress by caregivers.
20158969:77	Caregiver status and relationship to the care recipient did not substantially increase the risk of caregiver stress.
20158969:78	Discussion 
We examined whether caregivers' choice to provide care influences their subsequent self-reported stress.
20158969:79	Strong differences between choosing and nonchoosing caregivers emerged.
20158969:80	Results from caregivers who participated in our follow-back interview were similar to typical caregivers in the United States, especially caregivers of older adults, so they are generalizable to the US population.
20158969:81	Caregivers with a choice were more likely to be nonimmediate family members of the recipient whereas most caregivers without a choice were children of care recipients.
20158969:82	Filial obligation, or the obligation to help a parent on the basis of a cultural standard of responsibility, is a possible explanation for this finding.
20158969:83	This concept is based on the lifespan attachment theory, which proposes that a bond develops during infancy and evolves into the role of caring for elderly parents.
20158969:84	For some potential caregivers, adherence to social norms or familial bonds may take precedence over their reluctance to participate as caregivers.
20158969:85	Our findings can be used to identify a profile of caregivers at risk for stress.
20158969:86	Adjusted analysis demonstrated that, in addition to lack of choice in caring, high burden levels were risk factors for stress in caregivers.
20158969:87	Specifically, caregivers who were classified as burden level 4 were more than 4 times as likely to report stress as caregivers classified as burden level 1. These results are consistent with results of another study, which demonstrated that caregiver burden is positively correlated with caregiver psychological distress ( r = 0.30).
20158969:88	The drop-off for the highest level of burden may have been an artifact of small numbers, but it deserves more attention.
20158969:89	A threshold effect of hours of care and activities performed may exist.
20158969:90	In all 3 models, lack of choice in caregiving was found to increase the caregiver's risk of stress.
20158969:91	This finding has implications for the improvement of caregiver support.
20158969:92	An estimated 80% to 85% of care for the elderly is provided by informal caregivers.
20158969:93	The physical and emotional well-being of these caregivers is critical not only for their success as caregivers but also to the health of the recipient.
20158969:94	Feelings of stress and burden decrease their ability to be effective caregivers.
20158969:95	Our study indicates that having a choice in caregiving can greatly influence the emotional health of caregivers.
20158969:96	Families with disabled or ill elders should receive more social support and attention, possibly in the form of financial assistance to compensate for the needs of their informal caregivers.
20158969:97	Federally funded or state-funded assistance programs may alleviate the burden and stress placed on informal caregivers.
20158969:98	Support programs should also recognize that reactions (eg, stress) to major life events (eg, caring for a disabled parent) vary according to a caregiver's race, socioeconomic status, and sex.
20158969:99	Increased access to family and social support networks can counteract the negative health effects resulting from stress.
20158969:100	Our findings are subject to several limitations.
20158969:101	Study participants may have given socially desirable responses rather than the most accurate responses.
20158969:102	For example, social norms and expectations may lead caregivers to conceal their hesitation in assuming the caregiving role.
20158969:103	Another limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the BRFSS; the temporal relationship of caregiver choice to the outcomes studied cannot be established.
20158969:104	Specifically, highly burdened or stressed caregivers may feel trapped in the caregiving role and report they did not have a choice in providing care.
20158969:105	Caregiving reluctance may occur in response to caregiver burden, which includes both the type and duration of care provided and distress associated with caregiving.
20158969:106	Caregivers who had been providing care for many years may have forgotten the circumstances through which they became caregivers and were therefore unable to recall whether they had a choice in caring.
20158969:107	Prospective studies of caregiving relationships will strengthen the causal relationship we propose here.
20158969:108	Another limitation was that our outcome of interest, stress, was self-reported using a single question with a 5-point response scale; a more comprehensive and multidimensional measure would add substantially to the understanding of the outcome of stress.
20158969:109	In future studies, a series of questions, for example the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, may improve our understanding of the relationship between choice in caregiving and stress.
20158969:110	Nonetheless, the strengths of our population-based sampling methods and the diversity and size of our sample outweigh these limitations and add to recent discussion of caregiving as a public health issue.
20158969:111	Choice in assuming a caregiving role is a largely unexplored aspect of the caregiving experience.
20158969:112	Caregivers in our study who felt they did not have a choice in becoming a caregiver are at increased risk of stress, which may predispose them to depression or other poor health outcomes.
20158969:113	Additional research is needed to more fully understand the relationship between having a choice in caregiving and stress and to assess choice and caregiving outcomes longitudinally.
20158969:114	Likewise, reasons caregivers felt they did not have a choice in assuming the role were not explored in our study and may be helpful for designing interventions and reducing stress.
20158969:115	Future research should also investigate whether caregiver choice influences the quality and duration of care provided.
21050442:0	Background 
The calcified molluscan shell is an excellent model with which to study the process of biomineral formation.
21050442:1	The wide morphological diversity of shell-bearing molluscs (bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods, monoplacophorans and scaphopods) also extends to a tremendous diversity of shell micro-textures.
21050442:2	Despite this diversity, molluscan shells are produced by an evolutionarily homologous structure known as the mantle.
21050442:3	The polymorph of CaCO 3 (primarily aragonite or calcite), along with all other nano-scale features of the biomineral, are thought to be determined and regulated by an extracellular 'cell-free' matrix that is secreted by the mantle.
21050442:4	This matrix is incorporated into and surrounds nascent CaCO 3 crystals during shell growth.
21050442:5	Even though it constitutes only a small part of the total shell weight (1-5%), this matrix is clearly essential for initiating biomineral formation and imparting critical physical properties to the shell such as fracture resistance.
21050442:6	The biochemical characteristics of the matrix, usually purified and studied following decalcification of the shell, indicate that it is comprised of a heterogenous set of macromolecules including chitin, hydrophobic 'framework' proteins and soluble proteins and glycoproteins .
21050442:7	However, relatively few matrix proteins have been identified and characterised from abalone shells, perhaps the best-studied gastropod biomineralisation system.
21050442:8	To date these include Lustrin-A , Perlucin , Perlustrin , AP7, AP24 , Perlwapin  and Perlinhibin . 
Jackson et al. [ - ] employed a high-throughput EST sequencing strategies in order to identify gene products that may be directly involved in shell formation of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina . Hundreds of conceptually translated proteins putatively related to shell calcification were identified using this approach, however none of these have been directly characterized from the shell.
21050442:9	Furthermore, this approach cannot accurately discriminate between proteins required for non-mineralising functions, and those directly involved in shell formation.
21050442:10	When coupled with a proteomic approach such as we have employed here, these EST libraries constitute a valuable resource for the accurate identification and annotation of potentially full length, true shell forming proteins.
21050442:11	Here we have been able to unambiguously annotate 14 proteins from the nacreous (inner/ventral most) and prismatic (outer/dorsal most) shell layers of H. asinina .
21050442:12	One of these proteins, Has -Perlwapin, is homologous to a protein previously described from the nacre of Haliotis laevigata . We also identified Has -Sometsuke which is thought to be involved in pigmenting the outer periostracum of H. asinina  but apparently plays other shell forming roles, while Has CL10contig2 was identified from a mantle EST study but was not characterised in anyway . All 11 other shell proteins are novel and most do not exhibit any homology with proteins from public databases.
21050442:13	Given the high proportion of novel genes being reported from non-model EST datasets and the growing flood of sequence data from next generation technologies, these results emphasize the importance of proteomic approaches for the validation of coding sequences.
21050442:14	This is especially relevant for the field of molluscan biomineralization where most of the characterised biomineral-associated proteins have no known homologs in any model species . 
Methods 
Results and Discussion 
Like other haliotid gastropods, H. asinina exhibits a multi-layered shell (Figure ).
21050442:15	The thin external periostracum is primarily composed of organic components and is not calcified (Figure ).
21050442:16	The underlying layers are highly calcified and consist of a fine outer prismatic layer and a thick inner nacreous layer.
21050442:17	Prisms are micro-needles enveloped by an organic sheath (Figure ).
21050442:18	Nacre consists of the columnar superimposition of 0.5 μm thick aragonitic tablets, embedded within a peripheral thin organic matrix (Figure ).
21050442:19	By carefully removing the periostracum with sodium hypochlorite, we were able to subsequently extract the matrix associated with both prismatic and nacreous calcified layers, or with the nacreous layer alone (Figure ).
21050442:20	Of the nacre + prism material the AIM represents around 1.5% by weight, and the ASM 0.05-0.1%.
21050442:21	When analysed by one-dimensional electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, the nacre + prism ASM and AIM displayed few discrete prominent bands (Figure ).
21050442:22	When present, patterns of ASM and AIM staining appear to share similar bands, such as the thick band at 32 kDa and the thin discrete bands migrating at between 15 and 10 kDa.
21050442:23	Twelve and eight gel bands were collected from nacre + prism AIM and ASM extractions respectively, and were processed as described above for LC-MS/MS analysis.
21050442:24	Un-fractionated ASM and AIM material derived from the nacreous layer alone and the nacre + prism samples were similarly analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
21050442:25	These analyses were performed three times for the un-fractionated matrices, and once or twice for the SDS-PAGE bands.
21050442:26	For all samples, the peak list generated from the MS/MS spectra was directly interrogated against the H. asinina EST database using MASCOT software.
21050442:27	In this way we were able to identify 14 proteins from the EST data (Table and additional file Table S1).
21050442:28	The putative identifications of three other proteins, based on only one unique peptide, are indicated in additional file Table S2, but are not discussed further here.
21050442:29	No additional peptides were identified by including phosphorylation as a variable modification during the MASCOT searches, indicating that specific enrichment and LC-MS procedures are needed to analyze these post-translational modifications.
21050442:30	Nevertheless, 3 of the identified proteins - ML5A7, ML1E6 and ML5H8 - were mostly detected in the upper regions of the SDS-PAGE gel.
21050442:31	The discrepancy between their position in the gel and their lower theoretical molecular weight suggests either that the mature form of these proteins exhibits post-translational modifications, and/or that the full-length cDNA is not represented in the EST library.
21050442:32	Interestingly most of the 14 proteins which matches H. asinina ESTs are present in both the ASM and AIM, a finding that is in agreement with previous observations .
21050442:33	This might be explained by successive protein maturation events such as progressive insolubilization via cross-linking and/or protein tanning.
21050442:34	The organic matrix derived from nacre material alone contains at least 9 of these 14 proteins.
21050442:35	In contrast, conceptually derived proteins ML5A7, ML1E6 ( Has -Sometsuke), ML3E9, ML5B8 and ML5H8 proteins were detected in the nacre + prism material, but not in the nacre alone, suggesting that they are restricted to the prismatic layer.
21050442:36	We propose that these proteins are involved in regulating the growth and/or orientation of the prismatic layer, however further in vitro tests should be performed to test this hypothesis.
21050442:37	Even though we carefully removed the periostracum from the external shell surface by chemical treatment, we also cannot exclude the possibility that these latter proteins are also constituents of the periostracal layer.
21050442:38	We also found that all conceptually translated EST sequences that match our MS/MS peptides possess a signal peptide, indicating that these bioinformatically predicted proteins are likely to represent the entire amino N-terminus and are genuinely secreted by the mantle epithelium.
21050442:39	Conclusions 
In the field of molluscan biomineralization, this work constitutes the first attempt to marry transcriptomic data with proteomic data in order to identify novel shell matrix proteins.
21050442:40	By directly interrogating EST libraries with proteomic data generated from extracted shell matrices, we were able to annotate and describe 14 shell proteins from the nacreous and the prismatic layers, 12 of which are novel.
21050442:41	Screening transcriptomic data with peptide sequences is therefore a powerful approach to annotate shell proteins and to fully identify their primary structure.
21050442:42	The challenge that now faces the field is to characterise the function of the ever-growing list of novel biomineral associated proteins, using in vivo or in vitro techniques.

Permanent activation of the NF-κB pathway by the HTLV-1 Tax (Tax1) viral transactivator is a key event in the induction of T-cell immortalization and participates in HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis
null:1	Tax1-induced NF-κB activation occurs through the ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of the IKK-gamma/NEMO regulatory subunit in centrosome/Golgi-associated cytoplasmic structures, which allows RelA nuclear translocation and transcription from NF-κB-dependent promoters.
null:2	Although encoding a Tax protein (Tax2) that is also able to activate NF-κB, HTLV-2 does not cause leukemia.
null:3	It was hence proposed that distinct Tax localizations and transactivation mechanisms could account for these differences in pathogenesis.
null:4	We therefore compared the ubiquitination status of Tax2 and Tax1 as well as their ability to induce IKK-gamma/NEMO relocalization.
null:5	Surprisingly, while endogenous ubiquitination of Tax1 was easily detected, endogenous Tax2 ubiquitination was barely detectable.
null:6	Indeed, Tax2 ubiquitination was only seen upon ectopic expression of ubiquitin.
null:7	In addition and contrary to Tax1, Tax2 was excluded from GM130-positive Golgi structures but colocalized with calreticulin, suggesting a link between Tax ubiquitination and association with the Golgi.
null:8	We further showed that a non-ubiquitinable lysine-less Tax2 mutant retained the ability to induce IKK-gamma/NEMO relocalization, RelA nuclear translocation and transcription from a NF-κB-dependent promoter.
null:9	Our data indicate that contrary to Tax1, Tax2 ubiquitination is dispensable for NF-κB activation.
null:10	Altogether, our results reveal new significant differences between Tax1 and Tax2 and suggest an unexpected ubiquitin-independent mechanism for Tax2-induced NF-κB activation.
19860891:0	Background 
The evolutionary relationships of our own order, Primates, have been of central interest since the birth of phylogenetic analysis.
19860891:1	There has been consistent attention towards the relationships of primates to other mammals, with molecular and (more recently) morphological evidence providing strong support for the placement of Primates in the superorder Euarchontoglires [ - ].
19860891:2	Within Primates, the relationships within and between various families and genera continue to cause debate, despite the numerous molecular estimates of the phylogeny that have been presented over the past 10 to 15 years .
19860891:3	With increasing concerns over the extinction risks facing many primates, along with the recent publication of complete nuclear genomes from the chimpanzee  and rhesus macaque , there has been a resurgence of interest in resolving the evolutionary relationships amongst these diverse taxa . 
In modern classifications, the order Primates comprises two suborders: Strepsirrhini (wet-nosed primates) and Haplorrhini (dry-nosed primates).
19860891:4	This has not always been the case.
19860891:5	One of the foremost debates in primate systematics has long concerned the position of tarsiers.
19860891:6	Traditionally viewed as being more closely associated with lemurs and lorises, tarsiers were placed within a suborder Prosimii, under the gradistic view of primate taxonomy . Modern taxonomic schemes generally recognize their closer affiliation with monkeys and apes, grouping them with Haplorrhini . The majority of molecular evidence supports the latter grouping [ - ], although a large number of molecular studies still provide support for the Prosimii concept [ - ].
19860891:7	The question is succinctly reviewed by Yoder  and is further examined by Eizirik et al . . There is now general agreement on the higher-level relationships within the two suborders , with Strepsirrhini comprising Lorisiformes (galagos and lorises) and the sister-pairing of the monophyletic Lemuriformes (lemurs) and Chiromyiformes (the aye-aye), and with Haplorrhini consisting of Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (apes and Old World monkeys).
19860891:8	Within these groups, however, there are numerous disagreements over interfamilial relationships.
19860891:9	Molecular evidence has sometimes favored Cheirogaleidae as sister group to Lemuridae, although current evidence suggests that the four lemuriform families (Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, Lepilemuridae and Indriidae) represent a four-way split, which may be real or may simply reflect a lack of resolution [ , ].
19860891:10	Within Haplorrhini, controversial taxonomic issues remain.
19860891:11	The paraphyly of an all-encompassing Cebidae with respect to the tamarins and marmosets is widely recognized now [ , ], but the branching order of the major lineages is still questionable.
19860891:12	Among the Old World monkeys, particularly within Colobinae, intergeneric relationships are still unclear.
19860891:13	The timescale of primate evolution has also been the subject of numerous molecular analyses over the past few decades [ , , - ].
19860891:14	Typically, divergence time estimates made using molecular phylogenetic approaches have supported a much more protracted timeframe for primate evolution than that suggested by the fossil record . Inferring the age of the most recent common ancestor of all primates using molecular data has been of particular interest, owing to the poor understanding of early primate fossils and the contested affinity of Plesiadapiformes.
19860891:15	The oldest unambiguous primate fossil is dated at 55 million years , whereas molecular estimates often place the common primate ancestor in excess of 80 million years ago (MYA) . Estimates have varied with the reconstruction method employed and genetic loci used.
19860891:16	In some instances this has resulted in considerably different date estimates; for example, Raaum et al .  recently dated the Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea split at 23 MYA, whilst Yoder and Yang  and Steiper and Young  favored an older date of 30-40 MYA.
19860891:17	This is further exemplified by Kumar et al . , who showed that both sampling method and calibration dates affect the confidence limits of the estimated timing of the human-chimpanzee divergence (calculated at 4.86 - 7.02 MYA, depending on the preferred date of the split between apes and Old World monkeys).
19860891:18	Furthermore, previous estimates have been limited by the number and range of primate species, genera and families included in phylogenetic analyses, leaving certain groups (such as Tarsiidae and Daubentoniidae) in need of further study.
19860891:19	The task of estimating primate divergence times has been complicated by the presence of pronounced substitution rate heterogeneity among lineages, a phenomenon that has been of long-standing interest.
19860891:20	For example, Goodman's 'hominoid slowdown' hypothesis was proposed in the early 1960s , and has recently been strongly supported by genomic studies . Detailed analyses of primate sequences have revealed extensive departures from rate constancy in several other parts of the tree [ , ], calling for the employment of relaxed-clock methods that can explicitly accommodate rate heterogeneity among lineages . 
While there may be consensus regarding relationships across the main primate clades, there is continued disagreement at the species, genus and even family levels.
19860891:21	One of the primary challenges in primate molecular phylogenetics remains the issue that different markers support conflicting trees.
19860891:22	Introgression between congeneric species, occasionally even between species in different (if closely related) genera, is an ever-present possibility, as is the origin of whole species by hybridization.
19860891:23	The macaque example, as analyzed by Tosi et al . , serves as a warning.
19860891:24	Previous attempts to reconstruct the phylogeny of whole orders, even classes, have often used a "supertree" approach .
19860891:25	This method has a number of important weaknesses ; we also point out below that, in Primates, equating trees of different quality has produced some extremely misleading results.
19860891:26	In this study, we draw together data from a number of mitochondrial and nuclear genes to construct data supermatrices, with a view to developing a consensus tree and estimating dates for key divergence events.
19860891:27	Results and Discussion 
This study represents a comprehensive phylogenetic study of the Order Primates, with regard to both taxonomic and gene coverage.
19860891:28	This enables previous phylogenetic assessments of the order, which have been performed at smaller scales, to be placed into context.
19860891:29	Previous estimates of rate heterogeneity and divergence dates, which have been raised in a piecemeal fashion for various primate clades, can now be examined on a wider scale.
19860891:30	Below, we present and discuss the results obtained by Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analysis of three DNA data supermatrices (mitochondrial species-level, mitochondrial genus-level, and nuclear genus-level).
19860891:31	Conclusion 
We present a comprehensive estimate of primate phylogeny using mitochondrial data; a similar nuclear analysis is not possible at present due to lack of sequence data.
19860891:32	The multi-gene approach adopted in this study has afforded the opportunity to investigate phylogenetic inter-relationships amongst primates at a variety of taxonomic levels from species through to infraorders.
19860891:33	Furthermore, the combined data and methods employed have provided a novel opportunity to tackle phylogenetic reconstruction, divergence date estimation and substitution rate heterogeneity.
19860891:34	This study offers a novel reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships across the whole of the Order Primates down to species level and significantly builds upon previous whole-order phylogenies.
19860891:35	It provides substantial support for previous studies in a number of key areas including: the primary divergence of Lorisiformes within Strepsirrhini, the primary divergence of Pitheciidae in Platyrrhini, a sister grouping of African and non-African colobines within Colobinae and of Cercopithecini and Papionini within Cercopthecinae.
19860891:36	Other advances include a better understanding of species-level relationships within the lemurs, macaques and gibbons, and estimates of divergence dates across the whole tree.
19860891:37	In contrast to many molecular studies, but in support of others, our analysis has grouped Tarsius with the Strepsirrhini.
19860891:38	Whilst the majority of evidence supports a haplorrhine grouping for these taxa, the incongruence of some data demonstrates the uniqueness of these primates and the value of continued efforts to reassess phylogeny as new evidence and novel techniques become available.
19860891:39	There are still significant gaps in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships within Lorisiformes and Platyrrhini; crucially a range of molecular sequence data is required for various species within these groups before a convincing resolution can be reached.
19860891:40	The use of data supermatrices in the present study offers several advantages over a supertree approach.
19860891:41	Chief among these is the ability to co-estimate the phylogeny and divergence times.
19860891:42	In a supertree framework, the estimation of divergence times is performed indirectly.
19860891:43	In contrast, in a Bayesian relaxed-clock framework, all divergence dates are estimated from the primary sequence data.
19860891:44	This leads to a more realistic assessment of the uncertainty associated with date estimates, particularly when the analysis is performed using a relaxed-clock model with multiple calibrations.
19860891:45	In turn, knowledge of branch-specific substitution rates and calibration bounds can inform phylogenetic reconstruction .
19860891:46	Other disadvantages of supertree methods, as discussed by Bininda-Emonds , also apply to the present study.
19860891:47	A few apparent inconsistencies are present in the inferred tree, including the failure to achieve reciprocal monophyly for some recently diverged clades.
19860891:48	In the case of the mitochondrial sequence data, this could be due to the use of an effectively single locus, which heightens the risk of incomplete lineage sorting, a situation in which a gene tree is incongruent with the species phylogeny.
19860891:49	The paucity of nuclear sequence data should be surmounted in the near future, with the increasing availability of sequences for multiple loci and even complete genomes . Nuclear sequences, which evolve more slowly than the mitochondrial genome, could also increase the signal to noise ratio, leading to an improvement in the resolution of deeper primate relationships including final agreement regarding the placement of tarsiers.

21603039:0	Introduction 
Method 
The empirical research underlying this paper was performed as part of a project where we have been working as ELSA researcher associated with the nanoscience initiative at the University of Bergen (Norway).
21603039:1	All the conversations with nanoresearchers to be presented were conducted together with our colleague, Fern Wickson, who also took part in subsequent stages of discussion and analysis.
21603039:2	As follows from the above presentation of motivation and theoretical perspective, in this study we have wanted to take the inherent tensions in how the notion of ‘responsible nanoresearch’ is in use in the EC as a starting point for further reflections about what responsible nanoresearch might mean.
21603039:3	The EC-CoC provided the apparently perfect case-study to develop our own thinking around ‘responsible nanoresearch’ by understanding better how the EC-CoC is perceived by nanoresearchers, and to test out our own theoretical position with them.
21603039:4	At the same time we wanted to understand better what responsible nanoresearch looks like from the point of view of those working with the governance of science in the Europe Commission.
21603039:5	As ELSA-researchers, we often find ourselves providing connections between the “world” of governance of science and that of science itself.
21603039:6	Hence, we have not been interested only in the individual nanoresearchers, but also in the research institutions and in tracing responsibility between these two arenas in which it is played out.
21603039:7	The aim has been to challenge own ideas of responsible nanoresearch from both these directions, as well as searching for clues to how responsible nanoresearch might be achieved.
21603039:8	The main part of the approach has consisted in leading a series of conversations with nano-researchers at our university in Bergen, about the EC-CoC.
21603039:9	These conversations form the core of the research.
21603039:10	Secondly, this was complimented by conversations with three representatives from the EC; one nanoresearcher, one employee of the Unit L3 and one social scientist working with science policy.
21603039:11	Talking with individuals who hold positions in the EC, with different kinds of relationships to the EC-CoC, contributed to deepen the understanding of the EC-CoC and of the notion of responsible nanoresearch from various points of view within the European Commission.
21603039:12	While observations from the conversations with nanoresearchers in Bergen, making up the core of the research for this paper, will be presented under “ ” below, the conversations with representatives from the EC mainly serve the purpose of adding that different perspective in the succeeding discussion.
21603039:13	The series of conversations with nanoresearchers were designed so as to cover the plurality existing among the nanoresearchers at our own university.
21603039:14	At the time of the study, we had been working as associated ELSA-researchers in the nanoresearch community at the university for about 2–3 years.
21603039:15	We therefore knew these researchers well from a number of collaborations, teaching activities, seminars and formal and informal meetings over the years, in relationships characterized by mutual trust and respect.
21603039:16	When we approached them to ask if they would be willing to meet us for a formal conversation about the EC-CoC, they all agreed to make an appointment, and to prepare by reading the EC-CoC document.
21603039:17	Depending on the mode of our previous contact with the researchers, we approached them either as individuals or as groups.
21603039:18	In line with the aim to elicit the plurality of positions and perspectives within the research community, it was an advantage to talk to scientists in different settings, and to talk to researchers in various stages of their scientific career.
21603039:19	In the following analysis we do not seek to explore whether these different settings provided different kinds of responses, but see them as contributing to provide diversity.
21603039:20	We spoke individually with three senior researchers, attended a research-group (mix of senior and junior researchers, ten in total) in their regular weekly lab-meeting and met after work hours with a group of 4 Phd-students.
21603039:21	In terms of disciplines, the researchers represent the fields of physics, chemistry and molecular biology, all involved, however, in the interdisciplinary nanoscience research platform.
21603039:22	All of the 17 researchers define themselves as working in basic research or risk-research.
21603039:23	Each of the conversations lasted for about an hour, and we took extensive notes, and in one instance the conversation was also recorded.
21603039:24	During the meeting, the researchers were left relatively free to steer the conversations as they wanted.
21603039:25	However, a hard copy of the EC-CoC document was always there, and we tried to tie the conversation directly to the document and concretely to the text and formulations within it whenever possible and reasonable.
21603039:26	The conversations where conducted over a period of 9 months, from August 2008 to April 2009, and the fact that they were spread out in time allowed us to alternate between exploratory proximity and reflective distance during the time of the study.
21603039:27	We also, in manner of conducting our ordinary tasks at the university, met and collaborated with the conversational partners in other settings over the months that the study took place.
21603039:28	This dialectic approach, where we varied between exploratory conversations on the one hand, and individual reflection and discussion in our research group on the other hand, proved fruitful.
21603039:29	One concrete effect of this open method approach was that, early on in the research, it became evident to us that it was our investigation that drew the attention of the researchers to the EC-CoC for the first time.
21603039:30	Accordingly, we decided that our role as ELSA researchers had to be thematised within the frames of the study.
21603039:31	Indeed, it led to reflections on the implications of the proliferation of this kind of researchers for nanoST in general part of the object of investigation.
21603039:32	Findings from the Conversations 
Three Broad Notions of Responsible Nanoresearch 
This paper pursues the issue of responsible nanoresearch along two lines.
21603039:33	So far, it has focused on an empirical question, namely how nanoresearchers respond to the EC-CoC and what sort of reflections that are triggered when governance enters the sphere of professional responsibility and identity.
21603039:34	While maintaining the perspective of the nanoresearcher, in the final part of the paper we shall try to lift the gaze and discuss responsible nanoresearch on a conceptual level, along the line of three broad notions of responsible nanoresearch.
21603039:35	The first two notions exist as clearly articulated and contrasting notions in the public and academic debates about science and society of the last few decades.
21603039:36	These are also the crystallisation of the main two positions drawn from what was presented above.
21603039:37	We shall argue, however, that the conversations also allow for a third notion of responsible nanoresearch, emphasising mindfulness and Hannah Arendt’s concept of ‘thinking’—providing what we see as an important and perhaps necessary supplement.
21603039:38	In spite of its growing centrality, the notion of responsibility is often left unproblematised and undefined in the policy documents, as pointed out by among others Ferrari and Nordmann . In our view, Pellizzioni  provides a useful analytic disentanglement of the notion of responsibility.
21603039:39	He suggests that it has taken on different emphasis at different times in environmental policy—and with governance it has shifted again.
21603039:40	We find this sorting out of the different meanings of responsibility is valuable, and the analysis is presented here in a very simplified version.
21603039:41	Pellizzioni  points to four ways that the notion of responsibility is used in the context of environmental policy: Care, liability, accountability and responsiveness.
21603039:42	He traces their appearance and emphasis through history.
21603039:43	Until around the 1960s, he writes, the idea of responsibility was that of care driven by ‘before the event’ motifs and ‘in-order-to’ factors.
21603039:44	The welfare state was responsible in the sense that it knew what its citizens needed and its ability to act accordingly was unquestioned.
21603039:45	Increasingly faced with incidents of environmental damage, the emphasis of responsibility (in early environment policies) shifted towards liability dominated by ‘after the event’ motifs and ‘in-order-to’ factors.
21603039:46	It became more about legal instrument (such as for example the polluter pays principle) to assign responsibility for events that had already happened, although the notion of responsibility as argued for from within still prevailed.
21603039:47	As awareness of growing social complexity, accompanied by decline in legitimacy and authority, increased, the emphasis in responsibility shifted towards the dimension of accountability dominated by ‘after the event’ motifs and ‘because’ factors.
21603039:48	This was dominated by the need to justify choices and behaviour in retrospect vis à vis allegation or questions coming from outside/society.
21603039:49	Finally, within a theoretical framework of scientific uncertainty the focus of responsibility has tended to shift towards that of responsiveness dominated by ‘before the event’ motifs and ‘because’ factors.
21603039:50	Responsibility has to do with answerability to an outside demand to take action in order to avoid situations of damage or harm, “ a willingness to understand and confront the other’s commitment and concern with our own, to look for a possible terrain of sharing.
21603039:51	It entails readiness to rethink our own problem definition, goals, strategies, and identity.
21603039:52	” (, p. 557).
21603039:53	Despite the focus here on the willingness to evaluate own goals and identity, it is still a process initiated and motivated from outside.
21603039:54	These different ways to understand or put emphasis in the notion of responsibility resonates with the tension described above, which seems to stem from underlying understandings of what it is that one sees oneself as ultimately responsible towards: performing the role assigned to the professional in contributing to growth and progress—or towards ‘something else’, like for example the continuation of human life on earth , taking part in the contemplative and active life that constitutes the human condition  or being part of the ecological community of beings . We shall now apply Pellizzoni’s analysis to the notions of responsibility found (or indeed wanting) in our conversations with the nanoresearchers.
20140241:0	Introduction 
Synonymous mutations are frequently used as a neutral baseline to detect selection pressures at the amino-acid level . Yet many mechanisms are now known that cause selection pressure on synonymous sites.
20140241:1	Translationally preferred codons are selected for accurate and efficient translation in bacteria, yeast, worm, fly, and even in mammals – . Selection on synonymous sites acts to increase the thermodynamic stability of DNA and RNA secondary structure – to improve splicing efficiency – and to assist protein co-translational folding – . 
Synonymous codon choice can also affect translation initiation.
20140241:2	Most of the sequence elements that control translation initiation (e.g. the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes and the 5′ cap and Kozak consensus sequence in eukaryotes) are located in 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) – where high conservation and AU-richness have been observed – . Yet Zalucki et al. found a significant bias towards usage of the AAA codon at the second amino acid position in Escherichia coli secretory proteins . They proposed that selective pressure for high translation-initiation efficiency accounts for this codon usage bias.
20140241:3	Other studies have demonstrated altered expression levels in E. coli after changing synonymous codons in the region downstream from the start codon – . Kudla et al. synthesized a library of 154 genes of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that had random changes at synonymous sites without any change in the amino-acid sequence . They found that the GFP expression level varied 250-fold across the library.
20140241:4	In this library, the stability of mRNA secondary structure near the start codon explained more than half of the variation in expression level: mRNAs with more stable local structure in this region had reduced protein expression . These observations suggest that translation initiation is facilitated by a choice of synonymous codons that destabilize local mRNA secondary structure.
20140241:5	Here, we analyzed the local mRNA secondary structure at the 5′ end of the coding region in 340 species, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, fishes, birds, and mammals.
20140241:6	We used computational methods to predict the thermodynamic stability of local mRNA secondary structure in sliding windows downstream from the start codon, and used permutation tests to assess deviation from random expectation.
20140241:7	We addressed the following questions: (i) Is there a selection pressure on synonymous sites to reduce the stability of local mRNA secondary structure at the translation-initiation region?
20140241:8	(ii) Is such a selection pressure a general characteristic for all organisms?
20140241:9	(iii) Does 5′ mRNA stability correlate with GC composition, codon usage bias, or gene expression level? (iv) In prokaryotes, does 5′ mRNA stability vary with the optimal growth temperature of the organism?
20140241:10	Results 
Discussion 
We have completed a broad survey of mRNA stability near the translation-initiation region of protein-coding genes.
20140241:11	We have considered the complete genomes of 340 species, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, insects, and vertebrates.
20140241:12	We have found a general tendency for reduced mRNA stability in the first 30–40 nt of the coding sequence.
20140241:13	In this region, mRNA stability tends to be less than expected given a gene's amino-acid sequence and codon-usage bias.
20140241:14	Experimental work had previously suggested that increased local mRNA stability at the translation-initiation region could prevent efficient translation initiation and hence decrease gene expression level . 
We have found that there is variation in the extent to which mRNA stability is reduced both among and within genomes.
20140241:15	Among genomes, GC content of coding sequences is a major predictor of the reduction in mRNA stability.
20140241:16	The higher the GC content, the larger the reduction in mRNA stability at the 5′ end of the coding sequence (i.e., the larger 5′ ).
20140241:17	For prokaryotes, the optimal growth temperature also predicts 5′ . The lower the optimal growth temperature, the larger the reduction in mRNA stability.
20140241:18	Within genomes, 5′ also increases with increasing GC content.
20140241:19	In addition, it increases with increasing codon usage bias and gene expression level.
20140241:20	The region with reduced mRNA stability is located right downstream from the start codon and has a length of 30 to 40 nt (the first two windows in our analysis).
20140241:21	This region is similar to the one identified by Kudla et al. . Kudla et al. studied primarily a library of sequences encoding green fluorescent protein, but they also carried out a computational analysis of mRNA stability across the E. coli genome.
20140241:22	They found that across the genome, was significantly more positive (indicating reduced stability) in the region from nt to than immediately downstream . Our work shows that Kudla et al.'s observation applies to most organisms with known genomes, including bacteria, archaea, and both single- and multi-celled eukaryotes.
20140241:23	Further, by focusing on scores relative to the expectation in permuted sequences, our analysis excludes biases such as amino-acid content or preferred-codon usage as the cause of this signal.
20140241:24	Past the first two windows, decayed quickly towards a negative asymptotic value.
20140241:25	Thus, mRNA stability near the start codon is less than expected, but elsewhere in the gene it is generally higher than expected.
20140241:26	The latter result is comparable to observations made by Chamary and Hurst in the mouse genome and by Seffens and Digby in individual genes from several species.
20140241:27	Interestingly, for many organisms, in windows 3 to 5 dips below the negative asymptotic value further downstream ( and ).
20140241:28	This behavior seems to reflect a selection pressure for particularly stable local mRNA structure right after the translation-initiation region.
20140241:29	This increased stability may compensate for the reduced mRNA stability in the translation-initiation region.
20140241:30	Previous works have identified AT-biased translation enhancers in prokaryotes – and preferred nucleotide sequences regulating translation in eukaryotes within the first 30 to 40 nt of the coding sequence.
20140241:31	The mechanism by which these sequence motifs work is not currently known.
20140241:32	We suggest that the primary mechanism may be destabilization of the mRNA structure near the start codon.
20140241:33	By contrast, some motifs work by known mechanisms unrelated to RNA secondary structure.
20140241:34	For example, alanine is preferred at the second amino-acid position in highly expressed proteins in several organisms and its codon might bind to a complementary sequence in the 18S ribosomal RNA . 
We found that the higher the GC content of a genome, the more was mRNA stability reduced at the translation-initiation region.
20140241:35	This finding makes thermodynamic sense.
20140241:36	GC-rich RNAs tend to fold into more stable structures than AU-rich RNAs, simply because a GC pair has three hydrogen bonds whereas an AU pair has only two.
20140241:37	Thus, assuming that selection targets the same low 5′ mRNA stability in all organisms, we would expect that the decrease in stability is larger in GC-rich RNAs, simply because they start from a more-stable baseline.
20140241:38	Whether selection actually targets the same low 5′ mRNA stability cannot be determined by our analysis.
20140241:39	We found that the mean 5′ increased with increasing GC content.
20140241:40	This increase could imply either that organisms with higher GC content can tolerate a higher 5′ mRNA stability or that the selection pressure to reduce 5′ mRNA stability in those organisms is counterbalanced by other selective forces or mutation pressures that increase GC content.
20140241:41	For prokaryotes, we addressed the question whether the optimal growth temperature affects 5′ . Thermodynamics predict that the lower the temperature at which an organism grows, the stronger should mRNA stability interfere with translation initiation.
20140241:42	In agreement with this prediction, we found that the optimal growth temperature correlated negatively with 5′ . The organisms growing at the lowest temperatures showed the biggest reduction in mRNA stability at the beginning of the coding sequence.
20140241:43	This result was independent of the relationship between 5′ and genomic GC content.
20140241:44	In our data set, the optimal growth temperature was not correlated with GC content.
20140241:45	Even though some authors have argued that GC content correlates with temperature , more recent studies have disputed this finding . Our results agree with these more recent studies.
20140241:46	Within individual genomes, the reduction of mRNA stability at the translation-initiation region was greater in GC-rich genes than in GC-poor ones.
20140241:47	Besides GC content, we found that codon usage bias and gene expression level correlated with 5′ . Because codon usage bias is correlated with gene expression level, in particular in fast-growing microbes , , these two correlations likely reflect the same underlying effect.
20140241:48	The correlation with expression level mirrors the general observation that evolutionary constraints tend to increase with gene expression level , – . Whether expression level, codon usage bias, and GC content contribute independently to 5′ is unclear.
20140241:49	These three quantities tend to all be correlated with each other, and we cannot easily disentangle which of these quantities is most important for reduced 5′ . For example, in mammals, high GC content in genes can increase mRNA levels through increased efficiency of transcription or mRNA processing .
20140241:50	Using principal component regression, we showed that in E. coli yeast, and fly, the three quantities codon usage bias, GC content, and gene expression level all contribute equally to reduced 5′ whereas in humans only GC content and codon-usage bias seem to contribute.
20140241:51	We found reduced mRNA stability near the start codon in a wide range of organisms, including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
20140241:52	Yet warm-blooded animals (birds and mammals) showed no such trend on the whole-genome level, even though their genomic GC content is well within the range in which we found reduced mRNA stability in bacteria, archaea, fungi, insects, and fishes.
20140241:53	We believe that our finding for birds and mammals was caused by the isochore structure of their genomes . Gene GC content in these organisms ranges from 20% to 95% and is much more varied than in organisms without isochores.
20140241:54	The whole-genome average of 5′ may not be meaningful in organisms with isochores.
20140241:55	When we considered only to top 5% most GC-rich genes, we did find a moderate signal of reduced mRNA stability in these organisms as well.
20140241:56	What is the biological mechanism that links mRNA stability near the start codon to efficient protein translation?
20140241:57	There are two possibilities.
20140241:58	First, strong local mRNA secondary structure could interfere with ribosome binding.
20140241:59	Second, it could interfere with start-codon recognition.
20140241:60	We believe that the currently available evidence favors the latter explanation.
20140241:61	In prokaryotes, ribosome binding occurs at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, located a few nucleotides upstream from the start codon . Kudla et al. showed that synonymous mutations near the start codon can regulate protein expression.
20140241:62	They concluded from computational modeling that the primary determinant of protein expression was the stability of local mRNA secondary structure near the start codon, not occlusion of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence by RNA secondary structure . In eukaryotes, translation initiation follows a scanning mechanism.
20140241:63	The 40S ribosomal subunit enters at the 5′ end of the mRNA and migrates linearly until it encounters the first AUG codon . If synonymous mutations near the start codon could affect ribosome entry at the 5′ cap, there should be a correlation between 5′ UTR length and mRNA stability near the start codon.
20140241:64	The further away the start codon is from the 5′ cap, the less should local mRNA stability near the start codon affect ribosome entry.
20140241:65	However, we did not find such a relationship, neither within genomes nor among genomes (data not shown).
20140241:66	Therefore, we suggest that both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, reduced mRNA stability at the translation-initiation region primarily facilitates efficient start-codon recognition.
18922168:0	Background 
The chemical methods to regulate mosquito populations bear adverse impacts of resistant strains and effects on the non-target species . As a sustainable alternative, increasing attention is being paid to control mosquitoes by biological means, including the utilization of natural predators of mosquito immatures . Many of these predators, like the larvivorous fishes , crustaceans Triops newberryii  and Mesoccyclops thermocyclopoides , the belostomatid bugs Diplonychus (= Sphaerodema) annulatus D. rusticus [ - ], notonectid bugs Notonecta maculata  Enithares indica , Anisops bouvieri  and the odonates like Enallagma civile , Anax imperator , Brachytron pratense  and some other species [ - ] have shown potential in regulating mosquito immatures.
18922168:1	Even, the predatory larvae of the mosquitoes Toxorhynchites rutilus  and Tx. splendens  have been efficient in regulating vector and pest mosquito populations, both under field and laboratory conditions . In smaller annual habitats like containers and tree holes, the copepods, especially, Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides , can be effective in regulating population of mosquito immatures.
18922168:2	Of the several predators stated above, coleopteran larvae are one such group that has been explored less compared to other similar controphic insects.
18922168:3	The dytiscid beetles like Rhantus sikkimensis , R. consputus  and Colymbates paykulli, Hydroporus sp, and Ilybus ater  are known to prey upon mosquito immatures.
18922168:4	In ricefields and temporary pools, larvae and adults of dytiscid beetles are dominant predators and have a strong impact in regulating tadpoles and different insect groups [ - ].
18922168:5	Considering the predatory nature of the dytiscid beetles, an assessment of the larvae of Acilius sulcatus Linnaeus 1758 (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) was made as bio-control agent against the filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823, both under laboratory and field conditions.
18922168:6	The dytiscid beetles A.
18922168:7	sulcatus are common to abundant in the ricefield and temporary pool and bogs of West Bengal, India.
18922168:8	Since these habitats are also exploited by mosquitoes fro breeding, the results of the present study will highlight their use in such situations as biocontrol agents.
18922168:9	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Present study revealed that A. sulcatus larva was active feeder and remained active throughout day and night, though it consumed apparently greater [Z = 1.233 (Table value = 1.56); p > 0.05] number of mosquito larvae during light on phase in comparison to light off phase.
18922168:10	In recent years, predation and population regulation of Culex larvae by the dytiscid beetles Rhantus sikkimensis in India  Hydroporus sp, Colymbetes paykulli and Ilybus ater in Sweden .
18922168:11	However, under presence of alternative preys the selection for mosquito by these dytiscid beetles was less prominent compared to R. consputus . In comparison to these beetles, the prey consumption of the larva of A.
18922168:12	sulcatus was found to be higher.
18922168:13	Further, under field conditions, the reduction in the populations of mosquito immatures in presence of the larvae of A.
18922168:14	sulcatus indicates its efficiency as biocontrol agent.
18922168:15	The efficacy of A.
18922168:16	sulcatus was noted to be as good as larvivorous fishes like Xenentodon cancila fry, Gambusia affinis and Poecilia reticulata [ - ].
18922168:17	In the field larval densities reduced gradually after introduction of predator larvae in the mosquito breeding places and a significant difference in larval density was noted after one month from the introduction.
18922168:18	On the other hand, larval densities increased gradually after removal of predator larvae from the treated breeding spots and a significant difference in larval density was noted after one month from their removal.
18922168:19	Insignificant difference in larval density in the control tanks during the period of field experiment excluded the possibility of influence/effect of other factors and confirmed the role of predator in decreasing the larval density of mosquito in treated tanks.
18922168:20	Considering the natural habitats of A.
18922168:21	sulcatus and other aquatic coleopteran insects, the effects of alternative prey on the prey selection and predation ecology need to be evaluated prior to promoting these beetles for biological control.
18922168:22	Like the dytiscid beetles R. consputus and the copepods M. thermocyclopoides positive selection for the mosquito larvae by A.
18922168:23	sulcatus need to be evaluated.
18922168:24	Nonetheless, in conditions of coexistence of multiple species of mosquitoes the larvae of A.
18922168:25	sulcatus consumed the mosquito immatures without discrimination of a particular species.
18922168:26	This is relevant in field conditions where multiple species of mosquitoes will be present.
18922168:27	Conclusion 
The A. sulcatus larva has been effective as predator of mosquito immatures and may be useful in biocontrol of medically important mosquitoes.
18922168:28	From the viewpoint of efficient and sustainable biological control in the field condition, the aquatic predators should have a wide range of adaptability in the habitats apart from the predation of target mosquito larvae.
18922168:29	Further work is necessary to determine the proper methodology of mass rearing and augmentative release of Acilius larva to make this biocontrol procedure possible for wide application.

20018031:0	Background 
The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a rich platform for the study of cardiovascular disease and the application of novel, imaginative analytic strategies.
20018031:1	For Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 16, we use a semi-simulated approach using actual genotypes from the 500 k Affymetrix platform and the 50 k candidate gene chip and building phenotypes on the observed genetic variation.
20018031:2	Because blood lipid levels are a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease , we modeled disease risk on the lipid pathway, including both genetic and environmental determinants.
20018031:3	The FHS has reported that long-term averages of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels were highly heritable (0.66, 0.69, and 0.58, respectively) . Several familial studies also have reported heritabilities for LDL of 0.50, HDL of 0.54, and TG of 0.39 . Dyslipidemia, as a fundamental component of the atherosclerotic process, is a medically correctable risk factor with established efficacious treatments for reducing risk of coronary heart disease .
20018031:4	Thus, we included in our simulation the use and effects of dyslipidemic medications, which have an important role in shaping lipid profiles.
20018031:5	This simulation builds in the long tradition of previous simulations for Genetic Analysis Workshops . 
Methods 
The FHS pedigrees, distributed as GAW16 Problem 2, formed the basis of our simulation . In total, there were 6,476 subjects who had genotypes and simulated phenotypes.
20018031:6	After the simulations began, additional FHS subjects provided broad consent for data sharing; these additional subjects were not included in the simulations.
20018031:7	To ensure comparable data to that which was simulated, we provided a file that defined precisely which subjects were included and their relationships within families.
20018031:8	The ~550 k measured single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, distributed for GAW16 Problem 2 from both the genome-wide scan and the additional candidate gene platform (GeneChip ® Human Mapping 500 k Array Set (Nsp and Sty), and the 50 k Human Gene Focused Panel) comprised the genotypes for GAW16 Problem 3.
20018031:9	Novel fictitious phenotypes were simulated for subjects.
20018031:10	Although family members of the FHS attended various exams at different times, depending on the generation, we modeled our study as if all subjects were recruited at one time, calculated the family member's relative ages at one particular exam, and then assigned a simulated age for everyone at three time points, with 10-year intervals.
20018031:11	The mean age in years (range) for the simulation, by generation and visit, is shown in Table . 
The simulation model is depicted in Figure . There are up to six "major" genes for the lipid phenotypes HDL, LDL, and TG, and 1,000 polygenes for each trait.
20018031:12	Several polygenes have pleiotropic effects (i.e., several of these polygenes affect two or three or trait combinations simultaneously).
20018031:13	The identity and effects of the major genes are documented in Table . The locus-specific heritabilities of the major genes range from 0.1-1.0% under additive (AA:AB:BB, 0:0.5:1), dominant (AA:AB:BB, 1:1:0), or overdominant (AA:AB:BB, 0:1:0; heterozygotes show higher effect than the two homozygotes) modes of inheritance, with minor allele frequencies at least 5%, with one exception ( β 4), for which the minor allele frequency was 1%.
20018031:14	We simulated an overdominant effect ( γ 1) because there appears to be evidence supporting this possibility and this mode of inheritance is rarely, if ever, modeled.
20018031:15	The gene α 4 is pleiotropic for HDL and TG and interacts with β 5 in determining LDL (Figure ).
20018031:16	The interaction accounts for 0.7% of the trait variance, and β 5 has no marginal effect on any phenotype.
20018031:17	The locus-specific effects of the polygenes were on average an order of magnitude smaller, ranging from 0.002-0.15%, with effect sizes extracted from negative exponential distributions.
20018031:18	All polygenes act independently and have additive effects.
20018031:19	HDL, TG, and LDL share 40% of their polygenes in common, and HDL and TG share an additional 20%.
20018031:20	The specific identities of the polygenes, their locations, and their generating effect sizes are provided in the Additional Files , corresponding to HDL, LDL, and TG.
20018031:21	A group of 39 polygenes influencing HDL were clustered within 0.5 Mb on chromosome 11; otherwise, the polygenes for each trait are randomly distributed throughout the genome.
20018031:22	The overall effect of each trait-specific polygenic component was scaled to achieve the target total trait heritabilities of 60%, 55%, and 40% for HDL, LDL, and TG, respectively.
20018031:23	The remaining variance is uncorrelated among family members, with the exception of a simulated dietary effect (variable: diet) on TG levels that accounts for a correlation of 0.05 among family members, regardless of their coefficient of relationship.
20018031:24	The phenotypes generated from this genetic model were scaled to the empirically derived means and variances for the actual HDL, LDL, and TG traits within 13 age strata (in 5-year intervals) and sex as follows: 
where, for example, (HDL|age 5 year interval, sex) represents the mean of HDL in FHS, given a 5-year age interval and sex; (HDL|age 5 year interval, sex) is standard deviation of HDL in FHS, given a 5-year age interval and sex; h α 1 is the square root of simulated heritability for the α 1 SNP (as described in Table ); a α 1 is a simulated effect that reflects in part the penetrance of the α 1 SNP; sign is a random integer number that takes values (-1) or (+1) with the purpose of randomly changing the contribution direction of polygenes; apoly κ represents an instance of each of the 1,000 SNPs effects ( k = 1 to 1,000), selected as polygenes for HDL; hapoly κ is an instance of the of square roots of heritabilities for 1,000 SNPs selected as polygenes for HDL; a ε represents the environmental effect that contributes to HDL; and h ε is the square root of HDL variance explained by environmental causes.
20018031:25	As individuals progressed to the next visit 10 years later, their phenotypes were scaled by the appropriate age-sex means and variance, but there are no genes governing longitudinal trends per se . Instead, we simulated the complicating effects of medication.
20018031:26	The simulated value for LDL at each visit for each subject was checked, and individuals in the upper tail of the distribution were simulated as medicated.
20018031:27	The proportion of subjects that are medicated increased across visits to comprise 2%, 5%, and 15% of the subjects in Visits 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
20018031:28	These proportions were estimated from the FHS data, and reflected the secular increase in the proportion of individuals being treated for elevated cholesterol levels.
20018031:29	The response to treatment is governed by two loci ( δ 1 and δ 2) as pharmacogenetic processes.
20018031:30	The δ 1 variant has a marginal effect on both HDL and TG levels via additive effects but also, individuals that are homozygous for the minor allele are non-responders to the treatment.
20018031:31	Responders (homozygotes and heterozygotes for the major allele) exhibit a 10% increase in their HDL levels and a 15% decrease in TG levels.
20018031:32	Similarly, δ 2 is a variant with an additive marginal effect on LDL, and homozygotes for the minor allele are non-responders to treatment.
20018031:33	Responders exhibit a 30% decrease in LDL levels.
20018031:34	Total cholesterol (CHOL) level is calculated as 0.8*(HDL + LDL + TG/5), and has no independent genetic effects except those influencing the component phenotypes.
20018031:35	Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was simulated as a quantitative phenotype that takes many years to develop.
20018031:36	For this reason, CAC was modeled in two stages.
20018031:37	First, age-independent CAC (CAC AI) was modeled as a function of total CHOL, HDL, and five other genes ( τ 1- τ 5) having direct effects on its development.
20018031:38	CAC AI was simulated under the model 
where ME is a joint genetic effect from an epistatic interaction between τ 1 and τ 2, the effect of τ 1 is purely epistatic (i.e., τ 1 displays only a minimal main effect) while τ 2 displays an additional measurable additive main effect; PE is the joint effect from τ 3 and τ 4, a pair of purely epistatic SNPs, each with no main effect; Het is an effect from τ 5, a SNP that displays heterosis (over-dominance); and ε is the residual variation not explained by the factors mentioned above.
20018031:39	The term ε 300 times a random draw from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (300 × N (0,1)), represents the sum of normal deviations from the mean of each of the modeled genetic effects and "noise" from unmeasured environmental and genetic effects.
20018031:40	Because CAC cannot be negative, CAC AI = 0 if the generated value was negative.
20018031:41	The models for the effects on CAC AI due to the ME and PE genotypes are illustrated in Tables and . The minor allele frequency (MAF) for each of the four SNPs τ 1- τ 4 is ~0.5.
20018031:42	SNP τ 5, which determines the Het effect, has a MAF of 0.2. SNP τ 5 genotype 1/1 (common homozygote) increases CAC AI on average by 25, genotype 1/3 decreases CAC AI by 100, and genotype 3/3 increases CAC AI by 400.
20018031:43	CAC is derived from CAC AI by using a piecewise linear age adjustment: subjects under 20 years have not developed measurable levels of CAC, CAC buildup is linear from the ages of 20 to 60, and for subjects older than 60, CAC = CAC AI.
20018031:44	Table lists estimates of the proportion of the variability of CAC attributable to each of the genetic factors averaged over the 200 replicate datasets.
20018031:45	Whether a subject smoked during the period before a visit influenced the risk of a myocardial infarction (MI).
20018031:46	At first visit, men had a 27% chance to be smokers and women had a 23% chance.
20018031:47	Each smoker had an 8% chance of permanently quitting smoking before each subsequent visit.
20018031:48	The resulting smoking rates are commensurate with rates reported by the Centers for Disease Control for 1998.
20018031:49	The risk of an MI before each visit is determined by CAC and its interactions with smoking and two genetic loci, φ 1 and φ 2.
20018031:50	No MIs were fatal in our data.
20018031:51	Smoking and φ 1 have an interactive effect on risk of MI.
20018031:52	The effect of smoking is to constrict blood vessels, thus increasing the risk that CAC will lead to an MI.
20018031:53	The risk of MI for a smoker with the most common φ 1 genotype (3/3) is the same as that of an equivalent non-smoker whose CAC is 10% higher.
20018031:54	The risk of MI for a smoker with either of the other φ 1 genotypes is the same as that of a non-smoker whose CAC is 40% higher.
20018031:55	The φ 1 genotype has no effect on risk of MI in non-smokers.
20018031:56	Carrying the most common φ 2 genotype (3/3) has the same effect on risk of MI as reducing CAC by 5%.
20018031:57	The effect of any other genotype is the same as increasing CAC by 5%.
20018031:58	The final model for MI risk is 
where ∂ smoke is the joint effect of smoking and φ 1 (0 if a non-smoker, 0.1 if a smoker with genotype 3/3 at φ 1, 0.4 if a smoker with another genotype); and the value of the event variable is -0.05 if the φ 2 genotype is 3/3 and 0.05 otherwise.
20018031:59	The MAFs for φ 1 and φ 2 are ~0.3.
20018031:60	MI_risk was calculated for each visit and a draw from a uniform distribution determined whether the risk resulted in an MI.
20018031:61	The SNPs for CAC and MI event were chosen from the 50 k SNPs in the Gene Focused Panel based on desired MAF, completeness of genotyping, and lack of linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs.
20018031:62	The specific identities of the SNPs τ 1- τ 5, φ 1 and φ 2, and their chromosomes are listed in Table . 
Results and discussion 
The phenotypic simulated files are named simphen#.txt,
20018031:63	where # stands for a number from 1-200, representing the replication number.
20018031:64	The simulated data are archived in the dbGAP of the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the name "GAW16 Framingham and Simulated Data" . The 200 replications of the data include the indexing variable "shareid" that matches exactly with the same shareid of the Framingham Heart Study and can be used to merge the simulated phenotypic data with the FHS genotypic data.
20018031:65	The phenotypic variables provided are sex, simage (simulation age), diet, rx (antihyperlipidemic medication use), LDL, HDL, TG, CHOL, CAC, SMOKE, and MIevent, each associated with a number (1, 2, or 3) to identify respectively variables that were simulated for Visit 1, Visit 2, or Visit 3.
20018031:66	We tested all the simulated traits and causative SNP heritabilities as well as the respective association models.
20018031:67	Analyzing and interpreting data obtained as part of a genome-wide association study presents numerous challenges, as well as the promise of improved understanding of the genetic factors influencing complex traits.
20018031:68	For validation and a detailed analysis of the simulated model see the Online Supplemental Materials for GAW16 . Many genome-wide association studies have been published recently, and many more are being carried out on virtually every conceivable phenotype of biomedical or public health importance.
20018031:69	While the rate of development of genetic technologies has propelled us to this point, development and evaluation of statistical and analytic techniques is still underway, with many issues not yet satisfactorily resolved.
20018031:70	Nonetheless, important discoveries have been reported.
20018031:71	We hope that the simulated GAW16 Problem 3 provides data with which investigators can test the strengths and limitations of their statistical analytic approaches and software.

null:0	Introduction 
Previous studies have focused on the accuracy of the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination performed in the emergency department (ED), but have not evaluated FAST performed in the field setting (field FAST).
null:1	We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of field FAST by comparison with FAST performed in the ED.
null:2	Methods 
A total of 1,380 trauma patients were admitted to our hospital by air ambulance between April 2005 and October 2009.
null:3	We compared the sensitivity and specificity of field FAST with those of FAST in the hospital setting.
null:4	The presence of pericardial and intraperitoneal fluid was confirmed by the medical records.
null:5	Results 
Of these patients, 317 blunt trauma patients (mean age, 43.9 ± 23.8 (SD) years) were examined by field FAST and enrolled in the study; all participants were also examined by FAST in the ED.
null:6	The mean Injury Severity Score was 16.1 ± 15.4 (SD).
null:7	Forty-seven patients (14.8%) were ultimately diagnosed with pericardial and intraperitoneal fluid.
null:8	Field FAST detected 12 of these cases.

18629371:0	Introduction 
In the early 1900s, a German chemist named Adolph Windaus determined atheromatous plaque from human aortas contained 20-fold higher concentrations of cholesterol than normal aortas.
18629371:1	Soon after, the Russian pathologist Nikolai Anitschov strengthened this observation by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet and creating the first animal model of atherosclerosis ( ; ).
18629371:2	In 1955, a biophysicist named John Gofman used ultracentrifugation to separate plasma lipoproteins by density and correlated risk of myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.
18629371:3	Henceforth, the ‘lipid hypothesis’ proposed that elevated LDL-C, elevated triacylglycerols (TG), and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were causally associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
18629371:4	In 1977, the Framingham Study showed that elevated LDL-C and reduced HDL-C levels independently predict one’s risk for developing cardiovascular disease.
18629371:5	Since the first Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) recommendations in 1988 , guidelines have increasingly focused on aggressive management of elevated LDL-C in populations at risk for CHD.
18629371:6	According to the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) ATP III guidelines published in 2001, patients with established CHD, non-coronary atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, or greater than two major cardiac risk factors with a calculated Framingham risk score of greater than 20% should have an LDL-C goal of less than 100 mg/dL . Subsequently, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) and Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) trial reported incremental 22% and 16% reductions, respectively, in the risk of cardiovascular events with LDL-C levels lowered below 100 mg/dL.
18629371:7	Based on these data, an “optional” target of therapy focusing on aggressive LDL-C lowering less than 70 mg/dL for patients with known coronary disease or CHD equivalent status has been proposed.
18629371:8	However, despite lowering LDL-C to levels recommended by the NCEP in 90% of treated patients, an overall reduction of only 20%–35% in the rate of cardiovascular events has been observed in randomized trials.
18629371:9	Moreover, nearly 15% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have LDL-C levels less than 100 mg/dL at presentation, suggesting that previously cited LDL-C targets remain too high or the benefit of very aggressive LDL-C lowering is quite limited.
18629371:10	The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial showed a 2.2% absolute and a 22% relative risk reduction for major cardiovascular events in patients receiving high dose compared to low dose atorvastatin.
18629371:11	The mean LDL-C levels were 77 mg/dL in the high dose statin group versus 100 mg/dL in the low dose statin group.
18629371:12	Thus, while great emphasis has been placed on the importance of LDL-C lowering in CVD risk reduction, there is growing interest directed at raising HDL-C levels for further risk reduction.
18629371:13	At present, no approved therapies increase HDL-C levels by any comparable magnitude to therapies designed to lower LDL-C levels.
18629371:14	This review provides a detailed update on HDL-C as a therapeutic target for CVD risk reduction.
18629371:15	HDL-C and coronary heart disease 
Substantial epidemiologic evidence suggests a negative linear correlation between HDL-C levels and the incidence of CHD.
18629371:16	First proposed by, an inverse relationship between HDL-C and cardiovascular disease was not well established until the Framingham study in the 1970s.
18629371:17	This analysis of 2815 men and women aged 49–82 years identified HDL-C as a powerful risk factor inversely associated with the incidence of CHD.
18629371:18	Similarly, in the early 1980s, the Prospective Cardiovascular Munster (PROCAM) study evaluated 4559 male participants aged 40–64 years and found a strong negative linear correlation between the incidence of CAD and HDL-C levels (CHD risk ratio of 4.0 for HDL-C <25 mg/dL versus 1.0 for HDL-C >65 mg/dL, p < 0.001).
18629371:19	Data from four studies (Framingham Heart Study, the Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence Mortality Follow-up Study, Lipid Research Clinic Primary Prevention Trial, and Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial) estimate a 2% reduction in cardiovascular risk for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum HDL-C (Gordon et al 1989; ; ).
18629371:20	Individuals with low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women) are at increased risk of CVD, restenosis following coronary balloon angioplasty and cardiovascular death.
18629371:21	One of the first trials demonstrating the benefit of raising HDL-C and lowering TG levels in individuals with low baseline HDL-C levels was the Helsinki Heart Study (HHS), in which 4081 men with dyslipidemia were randomized to receive gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily) or placebo.
18629371:22	At 5 years of follow-up, gemfibrozil therapy increased HDL-C levels by 11% and reduced total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and TG levels by 10%, 11%, and 35% respectively.
18629371:23	Gemfibrozil therapy reduced the primary end point of cardiac death or non-fatal MI by 34% (27.3 vs 41.4/1,000, p < 0.02) with the greatest reduction found in patients with low HDL-C and high TG at baseline.
18629371:24	The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) compared treatment with lovastatin versus placebo for the prevention of a first major coronary event in adults with average TC and LDL-C levels, but low baseline levels of HDL-C.
18629371:25	Lovastatin decreased both TC and LDL-C levels by 18% and 25%, respectively, while increasing HDL-C levels by 6%.
18629371:26	After more than 5 years of follow-up, the absolute risk in the primary composite end point of fatal or non-fatal MI, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death was reduced in absolute terms by 2.2% in men and 1.2% in women with a relative risk reduction of 37%.
18629371:27	This study was the first primary prevention study to show that individuals with HDL-C <40 mg/dL received the greatest benefit, suggesting the lower cutpoint HDL-C of 35 mg/dL in ATP II should be raised to 40 mg/dL in ATP III.
18629371:28	These clinical trials confirm an increased risk associated with low serum levels of HDL-C and the beneficial effects of pharmacotherapy in adults with low HDL-C in primary prevention.
18629371:29	Patients with manifest CHD also benefit from raising HDL-C and lowering TG.
18629371:30	The Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) compared treatment with gemfibrozil versus placebo in more than 2500 men with established CHD, average LDL-C levels (<140 mg/dL), and low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dL).
18629371:31	After a mean follow-up of 5 years, gemfibrozil decreased TG levels by 31% and increased HDL-C levels by 6%, while levels of LDL-C remained quantitatively unchanged; there was a relative risk reduction of 22% (17.3% vs 21.7% p < 0.006) in CHD death and non-fatal MI in the treatment group.
18629371:32	Gemfibrozil therapy was associated with a 24% relative risk reduction in the composite end point of nonfatal MI, stroke, and CHD death (p < 0.001).
18629371:33	The Scandanavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group (4S) was a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating simvastatin (20–40 mg/day) in 4444 men and women aged 35–70 years over a median follow-up period of 5.4 years.
18629371:34	Simvastatin therapy decrease TC and LDL-C (25% and 35%, respectively) and increased HDL-C by 8% compared to placebo.
18629371:35	Simvastatin treatment resulted in a 30% relative risk reduction in overall mortality (8.2% vs 11.5%, p = 0.0003) and reduced non-fatal MI, ischemic heart disease death, and coronary revascularization.
18629371:36	The Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study (BIPS) was a blinded, placebo-controlled trial of bezafibrate therapy in 3122 patients with previous MI or angina pectoris and baseline LDL-C <180 mg/dL, HDL-C <45 mg/dL, and TG <300 mg/dL.
18629371:37	At 5–7 years of follow-up, bezafibrate increased HDL-C more than 15% and decreased TG levels by 25%.
18629371:38	The overall relative reduction in the primary end point of 9% was not statistically significant; however, a 40% relative risk reduction was observed in patients with baseline TG >200 mg/dL, suggesting fibrates may be beneficial in patients with known CAD and elevated TG levels.
18629371:39	Based on the epidemiologic data available, the NCEP ATP III guidelines raised the cut-point for low HDL-C levels from 35 mg/dL to 40 mg/dL, thereby identifying a larger number of adults at risk for developing CHD.
18629371:40	Current guidelines define “high” HDL-C levels as above 60 mg/dL.
18629371:41	The definition of “optimal” HDL-C will likely undergo further modification as data becomes available.
18629371:42	HDL-C metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) 
By transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver for excretion in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), HDL-C may retard the progression of atherosclerosis.
18629371:43	In animal studies, exogenous infusions of HDL-C or apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo AI), the major apolipoprotein associated with HDL-C, prevents atherosclerosis from developing or progressing ( ; ).
18629371:44	Similar findings have been reported in animal models of Apo AI gene over-expression.
18629371:45	Harnessing this unique ability of HDL-C requires further insight into the basic mechanisms of HDL-C metabolism.
18629371:46	HDL-C metabolism involves numerous enzymes and unique nuclear transcription regulatory proteins intimately linked to other lipoproteins.
18629371:47	HDL-C is a macromolecule containing lipids and proteins that transport water-insoluble fats in blood.
18629371:48	A phospholipid (PL) monolayer containing free cholesterol (FC) and apolipoproteins (Apo) surrounds a non-polar lipid core containing FC and TG.
18629371:49	Apo AI and AII are the major protein components of HDL-C.
18629371:50	Apo AI is produced by the liver and intestines and constitutes 70% of HDL-C protein content.
18629371:51	Apo AII is produced only by the liver and constitutes 20% of HDL-C protein content.
18629371:52	While Apo AI is ubiquitously associated with HDL-C, Apo AII is found in about 60% of HDL-C molecules.
18629371:53	Apolipoproteins serve as receptor ligands and enzymatic catalysts for all circulating liporoteins.
18629371:54	Clinical observations of premature CHD in patients with inherited disorders of metabolism resulting in low circulating HDL-C levels, such as homozygous Apo AI/CIII deficiency and hypoalphaproteinemia support the association between low serum HDL-C levels and atherosclerosis.
18629371:55	Conversely, individuals with inherited defects resulting in low serum HDL-C levels have variable or no premature CHD (eg, Tangier disease, Apo AI Milano, and familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency), highlighting the complexity of HDL-C metabolism ( ; ).
18629371:56	Characterized in 1968 by Glomset, RCT can be divided into four phases.
18629371:57	Phase one: nascent HDL-C acquires free cholesterol 
The nascent form of circulating HDL-C rich in Apo AI, termed discoidal pre-β HDL, removes FC and PL from peripheral cells throughout the body by interacting with a membrane associated protein ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues, known as ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1).
18629371:58	Pre-β HDL is rich in Apo AI and serves as a template for the generation of lipid-rich HDL-C.
18629371:59	Pre-β HDL is generated by either de novo secretion from hepatocytes or the intestinal mucosa, direct dissociation from chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LL), or as a by-product of HDL-C particle interconversion.
18629371:60	Once generated, pre-β HDL receives PL and FC from peripheral cells by associating with the surface protein ABCA1, which is expressed by the liver and intestinal mucosa.
18629371:61	Patients with Tangier Disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by two non-functional ABCA1 alleles and extremely low levels of HDL-C, exemplify the significance of ABCA1 in HDL-C metabolism.
18629371:62	Heterozygous individuals with a partial reduction in functional ABCA1 have a corresponding 50% decrease in serum HDL-C levels.
18629371:63	Animal models further support the critical role of ABCA1 in RCT.
18629371:64	ABCA1-deficient mice generated by targeted gene ablation in DBA-1J embryonic stem cells demonstrated a 99.5% and 99.8% reduction in serum HDL-C and Apo AI levels, respectively.
18629371:65	In this model, loss of ABCA1 correlated with increased accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, an integral component of atherosclerotic plaque.
18629371:66	Conversely, overexpression of ABCA1 in transgenic mice is associated with increased TC, HDL-C levels, and Apo AI with enhanced cholesterol efflux and reduced levels of atherogenesis.
18629371:67	Finally, crossing transgenic mice overexpressing ABCA1 with athero-susceptible transgenic mice, such as LDL receptor (LDLr) or Apolipoprotein E knockout (KO) models, reduced atheromatous progression.
18629371:68	ABCG1 is another member of the ATP-binding cassette family that promotes efflux of PL and FC from macrophages to mature HDL-C rather than pre-β HDL Macrophages deficient in ABCG1 also have impaired FC efflux and accumulate excess cholesterol.
18629371:69	Taken together, these data suggest that both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are potential therapeutic targets to raise HDL-C and promote RCT.
18629371:70	Transcription of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 is regulated by members of a steroid superfamily of nuclear receptors known as the Liver X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) heterodimer.
18629371:71	When activated by oxysterols from FC this heterodimer stimulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene expression, thereby enhancing cholesterol efflux ( ; ).
18629371:72	The heterodimer is also regulated by the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α and γ, which are closely linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.
18629371:73	PPAR-α and PPAR-γ agonists have been shown to upregulate LXR and ABCA1 expression and promote macrophage cholesterol efflux ( ; ).
18629371:74	Synthetic LXR agonists also promote cholesterol efflux in vivo and promote regression of atherosclerosis in mice.
18629371:75	Phase two: lecithin: acyl CoA transferase (LCAT) esterifies free cholesterol 
As FC is acquired from peripheral tissues, pre-β HDL matures from an incipient discoidal form into a larger spherical molecule.
18629371:76	Newly acquired FC undergoes esterfication to form cholesteryl esters (CE) which migrate to the center of the discoidal pre-beta HDL molecule.
18629371:77	The spherical morphology of mature α-HDL-C promotes further HDL-C metabolism and cholesterol efflux.
18629371:78	Cholesterol esterification prevents transfer of FC back to the periphery, thereby potentiating further RCT.
18629371:79	Mediating this necessary step in HDL-C maturation is the enzyme LCAT, which is synthesized by the liver.
18629371:80	Circulating LCAT esterifies lecithin and FC on both HDL-C and Apo B lipoproteins.
18629371:81	The phospholipid component of HDL-C appears to mediate binding to LCAT, while the apolipoprotein component activates the enzyme.
18629371:82	Recent evidence suggests that increased glycation of Apo A1 in subjects with diabetes progressively decreases the rate of LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification.
18629371:83	Familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) and fish-eye disease (FED) are distinct inherited syndromes associated with absent or impaired LCAT expression, respectively.
18629371:84	Low HDL-C levels and corneal opacification characterize both diseases, while individuals with FLD also suffer from anemia and renal failure.
18629371:85	Variable degrees of premature atherosclerosis have been observed in these populations.
18629371:86	Conversely, over expression of human LCAT in transgenic animal models correlates with a 7-fold increase in serum HDL-C, increases in Apo AI levels, and a marked reduction in atheromatous plaque burden.
18629371:87	These findings suggest that LCAT over expression may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of CHD.
18629371:88	Phase three: cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates exchange of cholesterol esters between HDL-C and Apo B lipoproteins 
The enzyme cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) exchanges CE from HDL-C for TG in LDL-C and VLDL.
18629371:89	Newly acquired CE in VLDL and LDL-C is then taken up by the hepatic LDLr for excretion as bile.
18629371:90	Found predominantly in the liver, spleen, and adipose tissue, expression of CETP is enhanced by hypercholesterolemic diets via activation of a sterol regulatory protein and through binding of oxysterols to the LXR/RXR receptor.
18629371:91	Heritable CETP deficiencies in the Japanese population are associated with significant increases in large HDL-C particles and smaller LDL-C particles with a lower affinity for LDL-C receptors.
18629371:92	Heterozygotes with a 40% decrease in CETP levels had a mean increase in HDL-C of 30% and no significant change in LDL-C levels, while homozygotes with complete loss of CETP levels had a greater than 100% increase in HDL-C and 40% decrease in LDL-C and Apo B levels ( ; ).
18629371:93	Despite these findings the correlation between low CETP levels and reduced CHD risk remained elusive as heterozygotes deficient in CETP continue to manifest atherosclerotic coronary disease.
18629371:94	Two population studies have associated high CETP levels with an increased risk of CHD.
18629371:95	A nested case control study known as the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort study suggested an increased CHD risk in patients with elevated TG and elevated CETP levels.
18629371:96	Data from the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) study also associated high CETP levels and rapid progression of established CHD in men.
18629371:97	In this study, treatment with pravastatin significantly improved lipid and angiographic parameters in patients with high baseline CETP independent of baseline lipids, suggesting plasma CETP levels may be a marker of response to statin therapy.
18629371:98	The role of CETP in modulating atherogenesis is complicated by dual pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic effects of transferring CE and TG between lipoproteins.
18629371:99	Potential proatherogenic properties of CETP activity include: 1) TG-laden HDL-C particles may undergo enhanced renal excretion thereby reducing total circulating HDL-C levels and RCT, 2) CE-laden VLDL and LDL-C particles may be acquired by peripheral macrophages and promote atherosclerosis, and 3) CETP also transfers TG from VLDL to LDL-C thereby generating small atherogenic LDL particles ( ; ).
18629371:100	However, complete abolition of CETP activity results in large, cholesterol-laden, dysfunctional HDL-C with reduced cholesterol efflux RCT capacity ( ; ; ).
18629371:101	Furthermore, CETP activity may be anti-atherogenic if CE-laden lipoproteins are bound by the LDLr for hepatic uptake and excretion.
18629371:102	CETP activity may promote RCT by stimulating LCAT activity and regenerating pre-β HDL.
18629371:103	For this reason, partial inhibition of CETP activity has been the focus of novel therapeutic strategies employing CETP inhibition as discussed below.
18629371:104	Phase four: HDL-C catabolism 
As CE accumulate in its central core, pre-β HDL-C matures into larger HDL-C particles known as HDL-3 and HDL-2.
18629371:105	These larger molecules undergo hepatic catabolism and excretion in bile.
18629371:106	HDL-C catabolism is mediated by 4 mechanisms: 1) hepatic uptake of larger HDL-C particles via hepatic scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) receptors for excretion as bile, 2) metabolism of mature HDL-C by hepatic lipase (HL) to smaller particles devoid of lipid and rich in Apo AI, 3) renal uptake of smaller HDL-C particles mediated by apo-E receptors such as cubulin, or 4) LDLr-mediated hepatic uptake of LDL-C and VLDL-C after acquiring CE via CETP activity ( ; ).
18629371:107	Pleiotropic effects of HDL-C: beyond RCT 
The vasoprotective properties of HDL-C extend beyond its ability to initiate RCT.
18629371:108	Substantial evidence supports the contention that HDL-C and Apo AI prevent oxidative damage, inhibit systemic inflammation, promote vascular reactivity and integrity, and prevent thrombosis ( ; ; ; Bonnefant-Rousselot et al 1999; ).
18629371:109	Approaches to raising HDL-C levels: lifestyle modifictions 
Approaches to raising HDL-C levels: standard pharmacotherapy 
While dietary and lifestyle modifications can raise HDL-C levels, their effect on cardiovascular outcomes may result from beneficial effects on non-HDL-C lipid components such as LDL-C.
18629371:110	At present, standard pharmacotherapy to raise HDL-C levels includes niacin, fibrates, and statins.
18629371:111	Approaches to raising HDL-C levels: emerging therapeutics 
Based on preclinical data, multiple strategies to enhance the beneficial effects of HDL-C are being considered.
18629371:112	HDL-C delipidation therapy, exogenous Apo AI mimetics, CETP inhibition, LXR/RXR agonists, selective and non-selective PPAR agonists ( ; ), and drugs targeting HDL-C catabolism ( ; ) are among some of the novel emerging therapies harnessing the anti-atherogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-endothelial functions of HDL-C.
18629371:113	Summary 
A considerable body of evidence supports the correlation between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular risk.
18629371:114	However, trials evaluating HDL-C targeted therapies are limited, in part due to a lack of pharmacologic agents specifically designed to raise HDL-C and our limited ability to measure HDL-C effectiveness.
18629371:115	As a result, there is not enough data to support guidelines recommending aggressive increases in HDL-C levels.
18629371:116	With this in mind, evaluating the clinical efficacy of emerging HDL-C targeted therapies will be of paramount importance.
18629371:117	Given the complexity of HDL-C metabolism, serum levels of HDL-C may not be an adequate indicator of efficacy.
18629371:118	At present, plasma HDL-C measurements have a ± 10% margin of error, which could lead to errors in measurement of up to 4 mg/dL.
18629371:119	The functional properties of circulating HDL-C levels, the kinetics of HDL-C metabolism, and the variable effects of HDL-C subfractions on atherogenesis are ignored by current laboratory measures of HDL-C.
18629371:120	While measuring HDL-C subfractions are not recommended at present, recent data suggests that increased Apo AI plasma levels and Apo AI:Apo B ratios correlate with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.
18629371:121	As a crude marker of RCT, measuring sterol content in fecal matter indirectly reflects the amount of cholesterol excreted by the liver as bile.
18629371:122	Emerging therapies such as Apo AI mimetics and LXR agonists increase fecal sterol excretion (FSE), while CETP inhibition with torcetrapib fails to affect fecal sterol content.
18629371:123	The clinical significance of FSE as a marker of RCT remains uncertain.
18629371:124	At present, volumetric IVUS in combination with standard HDL-C measurement is our best measure of plaque stabilization or regression.
18629371:125	Novel approaches using high-speed multislice CT, cardiac MRI, and intracoronary MRI may replace IVUS.
18629371:126	Clinical trials using both surrogate endpoints such as volumetric IVUS and carotid IMT in combination with hard clinical endpoints may be required to evaluate the efficacy of emerging HDL-C based therapies.
18629371:127	During the next 10 years, many clinical trials will evaluate the effects of HDL-modification therapy.
18629371:128	While the past decade has focused on lowering levels of LDL-C and non-HDL-C to reduce atherosclerotic progression and CVD events, the next decade may prove that HDL-focused therapy induces regression of luminal atherosclerosis and improves CVD outcomes.
18629371:129	We eagerly await the completion of the ongoing clinical trials employing a variety of novel strategies to raise HDL-C and possibly halt the progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

16734889:0	Background 
The publication of a microarray analysis of selected Neisseria lactamica strains by Snyder and Saunders  has raised some interesting questions regarding the distribution of genes between pathogenic Neisseria species and the non-pathogenic N. lactamica especially with regard to previously reported "virulence genes."
16734889:1	This paper has also highlighted the difficulties in comparing microarray data from complementary yet distinct investigations and places particular emphasis on discrepancies with one of our own publications .
16734889:2	This comparison has raised general issues for discussion and a number of points for clarification that form the basis of this response.
16734889:3	Initially, the two papers may appear to take similar microarray-based approaches to address the general subject of specific gene distribution between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Neisseria species.
16734889:4	Indeed, there are a number of similarities in the practical methods used, as would be expected for any microarray-based analysis, which makes the reported discrepancies all the more surprising.
16734889:5	However, there are also a number of important distinctions to be made between the two studies, primarily based on experimental design and data analysis, which we believe greatly influence the interpretation of the results.
16734889:6	Experimental design 
Snyder and Saunders determined gene presence in a collection of 13 N. lactamica strains, with a particular focus on genes previously described as virulence genes, and also reported the presence of a subset of genes in a range of commensal Neisseria species.
16734889:7	The microarray analysis was performed using a pan- Neisseria microarray with standard labelling and hybridisation protocols.
16734889:8	Each N. lactamica strain was directly compared to two other strains in a loop design that incorporated a dye-swap although data was analysed in a channel-independent intensity-based manner.
16734889:9	Stabler et al . determined gene presence or absence in a collection of 38 Neisseria strains, including both pathogenic species and non-pathogenic commensal species, to establish the phylogenetic relationship of strains that showed favourable correlation to other typing methods.
16734889:10	Genes present in all 18 N. meningitidis serotype B strains or present in 7 commensal strains were identified to compare the distribution of these genes in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.
16734889:11	It is important to note that this differs to the goal of this study suggested by Snyder and Saunders.
16734889:12	The microarray analysis was performed using a pan- Neisseria microarray with standard labelling and hybridisation protocols.
16734889:13	Each Neisseria strain was directly compared to N. meningitidis MC58 in a common reference design and data was analysed in a channel-associated ratio-based manner.
16734889:14	In terms of the microarray platforms used, there are insufficient differences to explain the reported discrepancies.
16734889:15	Clearly, the microarrays utilised by the two studies were of independent design and construction so the gene representation, reporter element sequences and PCR product amplicons will differ.
16734889:16	However, given the rigorous approaches to design and construction of both arrays, these important but subtle differences are unlikely to account for the level of discordance reported.
16734889:17	Even the strikingly similar hybridisation and washing conditions should produce a comparable level of stringency, which would be one obvious methodological reason for such widespread disagreement in the presence/absence calling of genes.
16734889:18	The major difference in the experimental design of the two studies comes from the comparisons made in each study and how these comparisons were executed.
16734889:19	By their very nature, microarray comparative genomics studies are always limited by the gene content represented on the arrays and by the number and representation of strains analysed.
16734889:20	In both cases, the arrays were essentially limited in content to the sequenced pathogenic Neisseria and therefore any novel genes present only in N. lactamica or other commensal species were not surveyed.
16734889:21	Likewise, the strains selected in each study were considered by the authors to be representative and suitable for the intended investigation.
16734889:22	It is evident that the analysis of additional strains may affect conclusions; Snyder and Saunders noted this with the inclusion of another N. lactamica strain that was not part of their initial MLST set and accounted for 72% of the strain specific genes they reported.
16734889:23	However, the distinct selection of strains for the two studies still fails to fully explain the scale of discrepancies reported by Snyder and Saunders.
16734889:24	One point to note would be that no pathogenic strains were included in the comparison by Snyder and Saunders whereas Stabler et al. compared all strains directly to a pathogen, namely the N. meningitidis MC58 common reference.
16734889:25	This is important to note with regard to the execution of the comparisons for the data analysis approaches discussed in the following section.
16734889:26	Data analysis 
When considering the above points, in balance with other reasonable explanations, it would appear that data analysis and subsequent interpretation represents the key area in which the two groups adopted fundamentally different approaches that may help to explain the discrepancies observed.
16734889:27	Snyder and Saunders employed an intensity-based method that analysed the two channels of a two-colour microarray independently whereas Stabler et al. used a ratio-based method that analysed the two channels of a two-colour microarray in combination.
16734889:28	Snyder and Saunders used a metric (pON) that reflects the probability of there being a hybridisation signal for each spot in each channel independently.
16734889:29	Whilst this seems a reasonable approach it takes no account of any relative intensity levels; a gene may be called present in two strains if the pON threshold is exceeded in both yet the relative intensity level may be significantly higher in one strain than the other.
16734889:30	For example, for a pathogen gene that was highly divergent in N. lactamica there may still be a low but sufficient signal intensity above background to call the gene as present in N. lactamica using the pON metric, yet this level of hybridisation would be insignificant when compared to the signal intensity achieved with a pathogen; therefore a more accurate call for this gene should be absent or highly divergent rather than present.
16734889:31	This also raises the issue that the PMT gain settings during scanning may have an impact on the number of genes passing the pON threshold and thus being assigned as present.
16734889:32	If this were true then a normalisation strategy would need to be employed to account for this to ensure the definition of presence is consistent across different arrays and strains and is not dependent on scanning.
16734889:33	Furthermore, the comparison of absolute intensities for different genes can be affected by factors such as the concentration, length, and Tm of reporter elements.
16734889:34	The authors have essentially adopted a one-colour approach to the analysis of two-colour data, although generally some form of normalisation and an attempt to address the issue of relative intensity would be included.
16734889:35	However, in their study relative intensities would not have been informative as no pathogens were included in the comparison.
16734889:36	Stabler et al. approached data analysis in a more common approach for two-colour data by first removing unreliable low intensity data based on image analysis QC flags, normalisation of ratio data to remove any systematic effects and applying ratio cutoffs to determine genes present or absent in comparison to the control strain hybridised to each array as a common reference.
16734889:37	The GACK software used to set dynamic ratio cutoffs and make the 'present', 'divergent' or 'absent/highly divergent' calls was set at its most conservative, classified as 'present' if the estimated probability of presence (EPP) = 100% and 'absent/highly divergent' if EPP = 0% with 'divergent' genes between these two extremes.
16734889:38	Snyder and Saunders wrongly indicate that the calls of absence by Stabler et al. were based purely on a lack of hybridisation; if this were the case then we would agree with the other possible technical reasons for this that they describe in detail.
16734889:39	In actual fact, the calls of absence by Stabler et al. are based on the ratio of intensities for the test strain channel and the common reference strain control channel.
16734889:40	Therefore, the call of absence depends on direct comparison to the positive signal intensity for the same spot which serves as an internal control.
16734889:41	This presents one of the great strengths of two-colour analysis that helps to circumvent the highlighted problems of missing or poorly performing reporter elements as the same reporter is being used in each channel of the comparison.
16734889:42	These fundamental differences in data analysis present the most likely source of discrepancies between the two studies as all subsequent interpretations are based on the issue of gene presence in different strains.
16734889:43	Snyder and Saunders were likely to overestimate gene presence and unable to discriminate conserved genes from highly divergent genes as relative intensities are not taken into account nor any direct comparison to pathogens.
16734889:44	In contrast, Stabler et al. are likely to underestimate gene presence due to the perhaps overly strict criteria applied to gene selection, that is, the need for a 100% certainty of gene presence in every strain within a group, that would exclude any gene just missing these thresholds in a single strain.
16734889:45	Given these two likely extremes it is not surprising that so many discrepancies were reported.
16734889:46	Data interpretation 
The final interpretation of data is clearly dependent on the methods used to determine gene presence as outlined above.
16734889:47	Many of the discrepancies reported by Snyder and Saunders were related to comparison with the microarray data of Stabler et al. but also extended to other studies identifying "virulence genes" or pathogen-specific genes.
16734889:48	Whilst we want to avoid an extended reanalysis and interrogation of both datasets, Snyder and Saunders make critical misrepresentations of Stabler et al. data that need to be addressed in more general terms.
16734889:49	One section discussed in detail by Snyder and Saunders relates to the genes presented by Stabler et al. in Table 3.
16734889:50	This list of genes was produced by identifying genes present in all N. meningitidis serotype B strains and excluding genes classified as absent in all commensal strains analysed.
16734889:51	The extremely stringent method employed was purposefully chosen due to the relatively low numbers of strains compared in this study and the desire to avoid any false positives.
16734889:52	Whilst there is agreement with Snyder and Saunders on the known strain-specific genes, reflecting confirmed gene absence, there is less agreement on a significant number of genes that will most likely differ in the degree of sequence divergence and thus relate to the methods used to determine gene presence.
16734889:53	Confidence in our own data comes from the fact that the relative intensities of these genes are in the order of 500 times lower in the commensals than the pathogens when compared to the common reference, suggesting these genes are highly divergent and thus likely to encode functionally distinct proteins.
16734889:54	Table 3 in Stabler et al. is also discussed in relation to the pathogen-specific genes reported by Snyder and Saunders in Table 3 as 5/6 genes were not reported by Stabler et al.
16734889:55	However, it is incorrect and misleading to conclude that lack of genes in this list equates to presence in commensals as suggested.
16734889:56	The reason for these genes not appearing in Stabler et al. Table 3 was due to them not meeting the strict criteria for inclusion rather than indicating presence in commensals.
16734889:57	The data for these genes also demonstrates excellent differential distribution between pathogens and commensals and so is in agreement with the findings of Snyder and Saunders.
16734889:58	This does highlight that perhaps the analysis stringency of Stabler et al. should be reduced to ensure that potential genes are not missed although this would increase the risk of more false positives.
16734889:59	Summary 
This response has hopefully highlighted some of the issues that influence the interpretation of microarray data from different groups.
16734889:60	To a non-specialist reader this may seem bewildering but it is important to appreciate that the application of apparently similar experimental approaches can lead to very different conclusions and the need to understand the basis of this.
20813035:0	Introduction 
Genomic studies have established four major breast cancer intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like) and a normal breast-like group that show significant differences in incidence, survival and response to therapy [ - ].
20813035:1	However, as gene expression studies evolve, further subclassification of breast tumors into new molecular entities is expected to occur.
20813035:2	In 2007, we identified a new molecular subtype, referred to as claudin-low, using 13 samples . These distinct tumors were found in both human and murine breast tumor data sets and were characterized by the low gene expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3, 4 and 7 and E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein.
20813035:3	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44 +/CD24 -/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype , and the expression of this CD44 +/CD24 -/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy . Overall, these studies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC features.
20813035:4	In this study, we comprehensively characterize the claudin-low subtype using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data sets and present the pathological and chemotherapy response characteristics of this subtype of "triple negative" breast cancers.
20813035:5	In contrast to the basal-like subtype, we provide evidence that claudin-low tumors are more enriched in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, immune system responses, and stem cell-associated biological processes.
20813035:6	The molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype in tumors and cell lines reveals a breast cancer differentiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial mammary developmental cascade.
20813035:7	Materials and methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Here, claudin-low tumors were comprehensively characterized, and many important biological and clinical features were identified.
20813035:8	Specifically, we addressed four topics for claudin-low tumors including (1) molecular features, (2) clinical and histological characteristics, (3) relation to established breast cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models and (4) differentiation status based on analyses of purified normal mammary epithelial cell subpopulations.
20813035:9	Molecular characterization of the claudin-low subtype reveals that these tumors are significantly enriched in EMT and stem cell-like features while showing a low expression of luminal and proliferation-associated genes.
20813035:10	Among these molecular characteristics, EMT and stem cell features have recently been linked to one another [ , ].
20813035:11	Indeed, expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors SNAI1  or TWIST1  or repression of E-cadherin  in mammary epithelial cells increases the number of stem cells, and these and other EMT-inducing transcription factors such as ZEB2 and TWIST2, as well as the mesenchymal marker vimentin, are expressed at higher levels in CD44 +CD24 -/low stem cell-like cells than in more differentiated epithelial CD44 -CD24 + cells .
20813035:12	Consistent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors  (Figure Figure S2 in Additional file ).
20813035:13	Thus, our data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the most enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence staining, it appears that these mesenchymal features are present within epithelial cells, which is a feature not seen in normal breast tissues.
20813035:14	Acquisition of EMT and/or stem cell-like biological processes has been associated with therapeutic resistance [ , ].
20813035:15	We observed that claudin-low tumors do show a lower pCR rate than basal-like tumors (Figure ); however, the pCR rate of claudin-low tumors was roughly equivalent to that of the HER2-enriched subtype (without anti-HER2 therapies) and much higher than luminal A or luminal B tumors.
20813035:16	Thus, as has been described for basal-like tumors , claudin-low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity, yet patients with these tumors still have poor survival outcomes overall (Figure ).
20813035:17	A potential explanation for this similar scenario of basal-like and claudin-low tumors is that chemoresistant cells with TIC or mesenchymal properties are present at diagnosis in these two tumor subtypes as suggested by our immunofluorescence dual staining (Figure S9 in Additional file ).
20813035:18	This is also in concordance with a previous immunohistochemical study of 491 breast tumors where high expression of mesenchymal markers (i.e., vimentin, N-cadherin) and low expression of CDH1 were found almost exclusively in the triple-negative subgroup of tumors .
20813035:19	However, our treatment response data suggest that these tumor cells with mesenchymal properties within basal-like and claudin-low subtypes might not have the same treatment sensitivity to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy.
20813035:20	Thus, further studies are needed to better characterize the treatment sensitivity of claudin-low and basal-like tumors to specific chemotherapeutics and/or targeted therapies.
20813035:21	The claudin-low nine-cell line centroid predictor developed here will assist immediately in identifying the claudin-low subtype and its possible predictive value in any neoadjuvant clinical trial with associated microarray data.
20813035:22	However, we acknowledge a potential caveat of the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor, which is that tumors with high stromal content might also be identified as claudin-low.
20813035:23	It is possible that the signature set of genes that are high in claudin-low tumors (and cell lines) are also high in nonepithelial cells, including fibroblasts and other mesenchyme-derived cells.
20813035:24	Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the claudin-low tumors identified in this study are tumors with low epithelial and high myofibroblast content.
20813035:25	It is also possible that this signature is one that can occur within epithelial cells, within stromal cells, or both.
20813035:26	Special attention to the percentage of tumor cellularity of the sample being analyzed and/or strategies that can differentiate tumor cells with mesenchymal properties (i.e., immunoflourescence assays) from normal or tumor-associated fibroblasts with mesenchymal properties are needed for the further evaluation of this signature.
20813035:27	Finally, from a translational point of view, it is interesting to note that the publicly available NCI-60 in vitro drug-screening database includes six breast cancer cell lines, four of which are claudin-low (BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T) and two of which are luminal (MCF-7 and T47D).
20813035:28	Among them, MDA-MB-435 cells have been shown to have melanoma characteristics , which is still a controversial topic . Nonetheless, there is a need to develop better screening programs of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines that resemble the basal-like subtype, as this subtype is missing from the NCI-60 set.
20813035:29	Invasive ductal, metaplastic and medullary or medullary-like claudin-low carcinomas share important biological relationships as defined by gene expression, suggesting that yet to be discovered common oncogenic changes might exist.
20813035:30	Metaplastic and medullary carcinomas both have a high incidence of methylation of BRCA1 , and ~50% of breast tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers show medullary-like features . In addition, MDA-MB-436 and SUM1315MO2 claudin-low cell lines have mutations in BRCA1 .
20813035:31	Moreover, we have shown that BRCA1 mutant basal-like SUM149PT cell line has a small subpopulation of cells with mesenchymal/claudin-low-like features, and that these cells give rise to the basal-like cells that dominate these cultures.
20813035:32	These data suggest that BRCA1 deficiency, which has been implicated in the differentiation of MaSC or bipotent progenitors into ER-positive luminal cells , might also contribute to the development or progression of undifferentiated claudin-low tumors and cell lines.
20813035:33	Although we have not performed functional tumor cell repopulating assays on human claudin-low tumors to show their enrichment for TICs because of the low incidence of these tumors (i.e., ~7 to 14%), there is, however, evidence that the claudin-low cell lines identified here show stem cell properties and may be highly enriched for TICs.
20813035:34	For example, Charafe-Jauffret et al.  reported that in addition to having EMT features and high expression of stem cell markers such as ALDH1, many of these cell lines contain functional TICs.
20813035:35	This is in concordance with another report  that showed that MDA-MB-231, SUM159PT and SUM1315MO2 have a high proportion (>90%) of CD44 +/CD24 -/low cells, and that the CD44 +/CD24 -/low subpopulation obtained from these cell lines was capable of self-renewal, forming tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice, and were more resistant to chemotherapy.
20813035:36	Lim et al.  delineated a human mammary epithelial hierarchy by performing cell sorting on the basis of two cell surface markers (CD49f and EpCAM) and a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including gene expression profiling of different subpopulations of the normal breast.
20813035:37	Using their microarray data, we developed a genomic differentiation predictor that classifies breast tumors on the basis of their differentiation status along a continuous MaSC → pL → mL epithelial hierarchy.
20813035:38	We observed that the information provided by the differentiation status adds prognostic value even when considered with intrinsic subtype and the classical clinical variables.
20813035:39	However, as developmental studies further characterize the normal mammary differentiation hierarchy, approaches such as the one reported here can be improved.
20813035:40	For example, much less is known about other cell types in the normal breast, such as the myoepithelial progenitors and other potential intermediate progenitors, which may be responsible for the development of other rare breast cancer subtypes such as medullary carcinomas.
20813035:41	Finally, a similar genomic approach based on FACS data coming from other developmental studies such as the ones by Lim et al.  or Raouf et al.  might prove useful in leukemia  or other solid tumors , where similar differentiation hierarchies have been identified, and thus this differentiation predictor algorithm may show benefit in cancers other than breast cancer.
20813035:42	Integration of the claudin-low tumor subtype together with the known intrinsic subtypes delineates a differentiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial development.
20813035:43	These data point to different cells of origin for each intrinsic subtype, or different stages of developmental arrest for each subtype with a common cell type of transformation, or some combination of the two as different processes may be occurring for each different subtype.
20813035:44	Indeed, Lim et al.  suggested that the potential cell of origin of the basal-like subtype in BRCA1 carriers might be the pL instead of the MaSC.
20813035:45	Alternatively, as suggested by our in vitro analyses of the SUM149PT cell line, BRCA1-mutated basal-like tumors might arise from transformation of a MaSC that is similar to claudin-low tumors or cell lines, but the claudin-low tumors stay arrested in this undifferentiated state, while MaSC or claudin-low cells in basal-like tumors are able to divide asymmetrically and give off differentiated progeny that then arrest at the pL state . The therapeutic implication of the claudin-low subtype will require additional retrospective and prospective evaluations, but what does appear clearer is that the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer may be reflective of distinct stages of mammary epithelial cell development and that the claudin-low tumors (and cell lines) show the least differentiated phenotype.
20813035:46	Conclusions 
It has become appreciated that breast cancer is not one disease, but in fact represents multiple disease types, each of which may require a unique treatment.
20813035:47	In this article, we characterize an important new disease group, namely the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, and show that these tumors have a poor prognosis and features of mesenchymal and mammary stem cells.
20813035:48	We also provide new tools for the identification and study of this subtype in tumors and cell lines.

21039561:0	Introduction 
The bottom-up effects of plants against herbivores indicated that plants have evolved a wide range of direct and indirect defensive strategies.
21039561:1	Plants defend themselves against insects directly through feeding (e.g. physical barriers or toxins) ( ; ) and indirectly through attracting natural enemies of herbivores ( ; ; ; ).
21039561:2	Both direct and indirect plant defences are constitutive and inducible, while induced strategies may be favoured over constitutive ones because of the low cost.
21039561:3	Some studies support a trade-off between direct and indirect defences because of resource limitation.
21039561:4	For example, plant species with a strong direct defence may not invest in indirect defence through the emission of specific volatiles.
21039561:5	In addition, direct defence traits, for example, secondary plant compounds and physical barriers, may also have negative impacts on natural enemies of insect herbivores.
21039561:6	However, a recent study revealed that there is no conflict between direct and indirect plant defences in a highly specialized herbivore–natural enemy system involving a brassicaceous plant species.
21039561:7	To enhance plant resistance against insect pests, defence genes from plants and nonplant origins have been introduced into major crops ( ; ; ).
21039561:8	Although transgenic plants, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-expressing crops, can effectively suppress population densities of target insect pests, concerns are often raised about the long-term and wider ecological risks associated with the release of genetically modified plants.
21039561:9	Rarely considered are the ecological consequences of transgenic plants on tritrophic interactions among plants, herbivorous insects and natural enemies ( ; ).
21039561:10	In addition, the potential effects of direct defence of genetically modified plants on the efficiency of their indirect defence, and vice versa, are not well characterized, which is probably because of the lack of genotypes that differ exclusively in the same defensive trait.
21039561:11	Tomato, Solanum lycopersicum is an economically important vegetable worldwide and a commonly used model plant for biologists.
21039561:12	It has long been used to study defence-related signalling pathways and gene expressions ( ; ).
21039561:13	Accumulating evidence from tomato and other model systems supports the hypothesis that the jasmonate family of oxylipins plays an important role in mediating herbivore-triggered direct and indirect plant defences ( ; ).
21039561:14	For example, impairing or silencing genes related to oxylipin signalling pathways render the mutants or transformants more susceptible to herbivores ( ; ; ; ; ; ) and less attractive to natural enemies under both laboratory and field conditions ( ; ; ; ; ).
21039561:15	Similarly, genetic engineering of terpenoid metabolism or overexpression of a single gene involved in terpenoid production enables the plant to attract more natural enemies (predator, parasitic wasp or entomopathogenic nematode) ( ; ; ).
21039561:16	However, in most of these studies, the direct and indirect defences were investigated independently, and only a few examined their relationship in a tritrophic system, for example, a tomato, spider mite and predator mite system.
21039561:17	Furthermore, the ecological consequences of genetically modified plants were rarely characterized under natural conditions.
21039561:18	Here, we investigated the roles of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway in regulating plant–insect interaction in a tritrophic system, including the behavioural responses of herbivore and parasitoid and the defensive signals in wild-type (WT) plants and JA mutants; in addition, the interaction of direct and indirect plant defences was analysed.
21039561:19	We used a transgenic tomato line ( 35S::prosys ) with constitutive JA signalling, and a tomato mutant with defective JA biosynthesis ( spr2 ).
21039561:20	Our study showed that, although spr2 mutant plants are compromised in direct defence against the larval leafminers and in attracting parasitoids, they are less attractive to adult flies compared with WT plants.
21039561:21	Moreover, in comparison to other genotypes, the 35S::prosys plant displays greater direct and constitutive indirect defences, but reduced success of parasitism by parasitoids.
21039561:22	These results indicate that there are distinguished ecological trade-offs between JA-dependent direct and indirect defences in tritrophic interactions under more natural conditions.

19419559:0	Background 
Obesity has a profound relationship with disability and, at severe levels, is itself disabling in terms of mobility and exercise capacity.
19419559:1	Excessive body weight is an independent risk factor for various conditions many of which are disabling (i.e. stroke, diabetes, osteoarthritis, etc).
19419559:2	Furthermore, many persons with an existing disability may become obese often due to impaired mobility and activity limitations.
19419559:3	As the prevalence of obesity is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, obesity-related disabilities will eventually become a serious threat to national health systems, specially if, in regard to children and adolescents, they occur in early life and continue for a longer life span.
19419559:4	Despite this evidence, supported by more than 100 papers published in the last two years with the key-words "obesity and disability", the physiopathological determinants of the obesity-related disability have been scarcely investigated.
19419559:5	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most frequent cause of syndromic obesity and occurs in 1 in 25,000 live births.
19419559:6	Its major clinical features include muscular hypotonia, childhood-onset obesity, short stature, small hands and feet, scoliosis, hypogonadism and developmental delay, resulting from a loss of the paternal copy of chromosome15q11-q13.
19419559:7	The syndrome has two phases.
19419559:8	Initially, PWS is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems and a failure to thrive.
19419559:9	This is followed by hyperphagia and weight gain between the ages of 1 and 6, leading most PWS subjects to develop morbid obesity.
19419559:10	Both hypotonia and obesity affect the development of motor and functional skills that children usually learn at that age . PWS children's ability in sitting, kneeling, standing and walking is delayed compared with children with the same age.
19419559:11	These patients develop their typical gait pattern already influenced by obesity.
19419559:12	In adult life, the progressive effects of obesity on joints, small feet, hypotonia and the other orthopaedic problems produce further gait deviations . 
Typically, PWS patients present with reduced lean body mass and increased fat to lean mass ratio not only if compared with lean subjects but also in relation to simple obese patients . Body composition abnormalities of PWS subjects resemble that of individuals with severe growth hormone deficiency or even of frail elderly people . In this respect, administration of growth hormone has been shown to increase lean body mass and decreases fat mass, and to improve physical strength, and agility .
19419559:13	However, long-term treatments appear to only partially compensate the lean mass deficit . 
Decreased muscle mass represents the proximate cause of the hypotonia but the pathogenesis of this condition is unclear.
19419559:14	Neuromuscular studies and muscular ultrasound analysis are usually normal . Histologic and ultrastructural evaluation of muscle fibers in PWS are scarce.
19419559:15	Sone  reported histochemical abnormalities such as fiber size variation of both type 1 and 2 fibers, type 2 fiber atrophy, increased number of type 2C fibres and decreased number of type 2B fiber, thus suggesting that primary muscle pathology play a role in hypotonia and weakness.
19419559:16	Other studies demonstrated an abnormal proportions of type 2 muscle fiber subtypes[ - ] 
In addition to such relative sarcopenia and abnormal muscle fibres composition, PWS patients show a reduced pattern of spontaneous physical activity . Evidence exists that a short (up to 10 minutes) daily muscle training programs in a home setting may increase lean mass and spontaneous physical activity, as assessed by DEXA and pedometer registration, respectively . Adequate increase in muscle mass in response to enhanced physical activity seems to point to the diminished spontaneous physical activity as the main cause for decreased muscle mass in PWS subjects, but further research is needed.
19419559:17	Together with the determination of muscle mass and fibres composition, objective characterization of muscle function may ultimately help identifying specific deficits amendable with tailored rehabilitation programs and providing baseline and outcome measures.
19419559:18	From a functional perspective, to date there are only few papers providing quantitative data of lower limb muscle strength in non-syndromal obese subjects [ - ].
19419559:19	Physical strength and functional capacities of PWS subjects has been previously performed by manual non-instrumental testing  and with a modified Bruininks-Oseretsky test .
19419559:20	The literature fails to provide objective instrumental data regarding physical capacities in PWS.
19419559:21	The objective characterization of muscle function could quantify specific strength deficits and provide baseline and outcome measures in the rehabilitation of PWS.
19419559:22	In this wake, the aim of our study was therefore to provide some preliminary reference data of lower limb muscle strength in a group of adult patients with PWS using a dynamometer.
19419559:23	In order to ascertain whether differences in performance are related solely to excessive body weight, the results were compared with those obtained both in patients affected by non-syndromal obesity and in a group of normal-weight subjects.
19419559:24	Methods 
Results 
Discussion and conclusion 
Our results provide an objective functional picture characterizing the muscle function of PWS and obese population as compared to normal-weight control subjects.
19419559:25	The novel aspect of our study is the determination of objective measures of lower limbs muscle strength in PWS and the comparison with non-syndromal obese patients.
19419559:26	Efficient lower limb muscles are the key to independent mobility and strength of the flexor and extensor muscles is highly correlated with the capacity to execute daily tasks safely . The relationship between strength and mobility tasks is curvilinear, suggesting that other factors than muscle function contribute to mobility, still muscle strength is considered the most important factor to enhance mobility .
19419559:27	It has been shown that reduced muscle strength relative to body weight induces earlier fatigue of the quadriceps muscles in the obese which, in turn, reduces shock attenuation and increases the loading rate and variability at the knee during gait . Quadriceps muscle strength is known to be an important factor governing the vibration dampening of the lower limb  and its weakness is known to be a risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis [ - ].
19419559:28	Lower rates of musculoskeletal loading have been found in strength-trained females when compared with sedentary females walking at similar speeds, suggesting that increased muscular strength may enhance shock attenuation . Despite the implications of such biomechanical data, there is scanty evidence of functional quantification in overweight patients.
19419559:29	Physical strength in PWS has been previously analyzed only by means of non-instrumental functional tests . In our study, the H, O and PWS populations appear to be clearly stratified with regard to muscle strength, and PWS showed the lowest absolute peak torque for knee flexor and extensor muscles at all three angular velocities as compared to H (-47%) and O (-55%) (Tab.
19419559:30	2).
19419559:31	Our data show that PWS were the least performing subjects.
19419559:32	Reduced muscle tone, early childhood obesity, an impaired muscular trophic response could negatively interfere with muscular strength and coordination development, as well as with motor planning skills and account for the lowest absolute strength measured.
19419559:33	On the other hand, it is not possible to exclude that the impairment of lower limb muscle function associated with PWS may be secondary to different mechanisms from those observed in patients with non-syndromic obesity, e.g. primary muscle pathology.
19419559:34	The comparison of syndromal and non-syndromal obese subjects suggests that other factors than obesity per se seem to contribute to reduced muscular strength in PWS.
19419559:35	However, we did not measure physical activity levels in PWS since surveys and recall instruments are scarcely reliable in a population that has difficulty recalling such information . 
Our PWS had a significantly higher BMI as compared to non-syndromal obese patients (p < 0.01).
19419559:36	When PWS strength data were normalised for BW a 70% and a 50% reduction in PT as compared to H and O, respectively, was evident.
19419559:37	The percentage strength loss of PWS as compared to O appears unaffected by normalization, suggesting that other factors than obesity contribute to reduce muscular strength in PWS, while the difference between PWS and H increased after taking BW into account.
19419559:38	Non-syndromal obese subjects produced greater absolute isokinetic torque than their lean counterpart, which is in line with recent reports . Absolute strength is higher in O than H possibly due to a higher absolute fat-free mass rate in O, which is correlated to BMI.
19419559:39	It could be therefore hypothesised that obese patients retain a greater muscle mass in response to a greater loading, which could act as training stimulus.
19419559:40	However, when data are normalized per BW, O showed significantly lower knee flexors and extensors strength as compared to H. 
Normalization per BW instead of the more common normalization per fat-free mass was chosen to represent in some way the load bearing on the muscles, which is in actual fact one of the major biomechanical constraint in obese subjects.
19419559:41	In our opinion, normalization per BW may provide a realistic picture of the functional capacity of obese patients with regard to their BW.
19419559:42	In other terms, such normalization may appropriately reflect the disabling degree of the motor limitation of obese subjects and represent a more meaningful indicator of physical capacity.
19419559:43	In fact, it has been shown that muscle power, hence strength under dynamic conditions, normalized per BW is reliably related with functional performance in obese patients . 
Duvigneaud  and Maffiuletti  reported that muscle strength per unit of fat-free mass was similar in obese and non-obese adolescents, suggesting that obesity has little or no effect on quadriceps muscle function characteristics.
19419559:44	Expectedly, by normalizing per fat-free mass, which is an indirect indicator of muscular mass, strength differences between obese and controls disappear.
19419559:45	Another reason for discrepancy with our data may be related to the different age of the patients.
19419559:46	Interestingly, the same authors  speculated that the reduced functional capacity of obese adolescents during motor tasks involving squatting and kneeling could be secondary to the obese producing their maximal strength at shorter muscle length (40° knee flexion) rather than at 80° knee flexion, where their lean counterparts obtained the peak values .
19419559:47	However, our data on the angle at which peak strength was achieved are in contrast with those previous observations, with PT angles non significantly different among PWS, obese patients and controls, except for the knee extensors at higher angular speed (240°/s) and knee flexors at lower speed (60°/s), where PWS seem to obtain peak strength values at greater knee angles than O and H.
19419559:48	We decided to measure strength under three conditions of angular velocities (low: 60°/s, moderate: 180°/s, high: 240°/s) to provide a comprehensive profile of individual muscular strength and power . 
The significant speed × group interaction we found in PT is probably the result of the lower absolute extensor decline in the PWS group (-32.4
19419559:49	Nm) than H (-52.4
19419559:50	Nm) and O (-59.8
19419559:51	Nm).
19419559:52	A similar decline was observed in flexors' PT: -19.4
19419559:53	Nm in PWS group, -33.2
19419559:54	Nm in H and -33.9
19419559:55	Nm in O.
19419559:56	When normalizing per body weight the same behavior was evident.
19419559:57	Even more, we observed a more evident strength gap at higher angular velocities in both knee flexion and extension.
19419559:58	This seems to suggest that muscle power more than strength might be reduced primarily in PWS and in obese as compared to normal-weight subjects.
19419559:59	Muscle power is highly correlated with mobility tasks, describing more of the variance than does isometric strength in these tasks.
19419559:60	Short-term performance, such as raising from a chair, however, showed higher correlations with muscle strength rather than power .
19419559:61	This is probably due to the fact that strength per se rather than the rate at which force is generated is important in such tasks.
19419559:62	However, muscular power output depends from a combination of factors including muscle strength and fibres composition and neural drive.
19419559:63	In addition to strength data, bioptic evidence on fibers composition and functional investigation on motor units recruitment in PWS and obese patients will be needed to unveil the physiological basis of our results.
19419559:64	In line with the above mentioned studies , we observed that the knee flexion strength values were on average half of those reported for extension in the O and H groups, with significant differences for all reported parameters (P < 0.01).
19419559:65	The same results were obtained in PWS subjects.
19419559:66	The ratio between flexor and extensor muscle strength appears to be altered in the O and PWS populations as compared to H. Specifically, the lower ratio in the O group is due solely to higher extensor strength as compared to H.
19419559:67	This could be explained by a training effect on the anti-gravitary muscles (i.e.: extensors) caused by the exposure to higher body weight.
19419559:68	The same effect could account for the ratio value in the PWS population, although their muscle strength values were approximately half of those observed in O.
19419559:69	It has been previously reported that the stimulation of motor activity, through its positive action on lean mass, muscular strength and energy balance, may contribute to increase the physical performances of patients with PWS . In this wake, our study provides some initial reference values for further research on muscle function of adult patients with PWS.
19419559:70	A possible bias of our study is the low sample size which decreases its external validity.
19419559:71	It should however be beared in mind that PWS is a rare syndrome and muscle strength is gender-specific.
19419559:72	We decided to limit our investigation to female subjects and therefore only a small number of PWS patients could be recruited.
19419559:73	In general, few data are reported in the recent literature on the obesity-disability relationship, even if obesity should be acknowledged as a cause of disability.
19419559:74	BMI is certainly related to the individual functional capabilities , but should not be considered the only measurement of obesity-related physical impairment.
19419559:75	In this context, there is a need for functional measurements that can be more predictive of the actual individual physical capacities.
19419559:76	The objective characterization of muscle function performed in this study provides baseline and outcome measures that may quantify specific strength deficits amendable with tailored rehabilitation programs and monitor effectiveness of treatments.

20062723:0	Introduction 
Patients with patellofemoral instability with trochlear dysplasia may be treated with trochlear osteotomy.
20062723:1	We report a case of a patient with symptomatic bony patellofemoral impingement after a failed trochlear osteotomy.
20062723:2	She was subsequently treated with patellofemoral arthroplasty.
20062723:3	Case presentation 
A 33-year-old Dutch Caucasian woman was referred to our clinic with signs of painful bony impingement of the left patellofemoral joint.
20062723:4	One year before presentation, she underwent a trochlear osteotomy of the left knee for recurrent patellofemoral instability with signs of trochlear dysplasia (Figure ).
20062723:5	There was no patella alta.
20062723:6	Conservative treatment with physical therapy, activity modification, and taping had failed to relieve the patellofemoral instability.
20062723:7	There was no history of any previous surgical procedures or trauma.
20062723:8	In reviewing the operative records no complications during or directly after trochlear osteotomy were noted.
20062723:9	Trochlear osteotomy was performed through a lateral parapatellar approach with the knee in full extension, allowing the patella to be retracted medially.
20062723:10	After incomplete subchondral osteotomy of the anterior aspect of the lateral condyle with curved osteotomes, the articular cartilage of the anterior aspect of the lateral condyle was elevated in one piece to a height of 8 mm.
20062723:11	Height was maintained by inserting a wedge shaped bone graft from the iliac crest and osteosynthesis with 2 screws.
20062723:12	Patellofemoral stability was assessed through a full range of motion, and considered adequate.
20062723:13	The synovial lining and lateral retinaculum were closed.
20062723:14	No additional medial soft tissue surgery was performed.
20062723:15	Direct postoperative partial weight bearing was advised with crutches, after 6 weeks full weight bearing was allowed.
20062723:16	Five months later she still had persistent pain on the anterior aspect of the left knee without a history of trauma or patellar dislocation since the procedure.
20062723:17	Radiographic examination demonstrated nonunion of the trochlear osteotomy with dislocation of subchondral bone resulting in an irregular patellofemoral joint (Figure ).
20062723:18	Arthroscopy was performed with removal of the screws.
20062723:19	Since patellofemoral joint preserving surgery was considered inadequate, she was referred to our hospital for further treatment.
20062723:20	On physical examination there was painful limited range of motion with 90 degrees of flexion.
20062723:21	No signs of infection were observed.
20062723:22	There was obvious quadriceps muscle wasting.
20062723:23	Palpation of lateral retinaculum and lateral condyle was painful.
20062723:24	Moving from flexion to maximal extension, the patella was found to wobble at approximately 30 degrees of flexion.
20062723:25	A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the left knee demonstrated the irregular condyle (Figure ).
20062723:26	Because of incapacitating pain, patellofemoral joint replacement was advised.
20062723:27	Using a medial parapatellar incision, the knee joint was inspected.
20062723:28	The anterior aspect of the lateral condyle was deformed with grade 4 cartilage degeneration.
20062723:29	The remaining trochlea was dysplastic (Figure ).
20062723:30	Inspection of the patella showed no clear medial and lateral facets, with only the odd facet readily visible.
20062723:31	On the lateral side a 1 × 1 cm grade 4 lesion was present.
20062723:32	The femorotibial compartments showed no degenerative changes.
20062723:33	Patellofemoral arthroplasty was performed using the Journey PFJ (Smith&Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee) (Figure ).
20062723:34	The irregular anterior femur was resected using the standard cutting blocks.
20062723:35	Condylar support for the prosthesis was adequate.
20062723:36	Postoperative rehabilitation was uneventful, and at last follow-up at 6 months the patient demonstrated good function of the left knee with 140 degrees of flexion.
20062723:37	There were no signs of patellofemoral instability and she experienced only slight anterior knee pain.
20062723:38	Conclusion 
Patellofemoral instability may result from anatomical deficiencies in one of three anatomical structures that stabilise the patellofemoral joint: the trochlear groove geometry, the medial and lateral retinacula including the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), and the alignment of the extensor apparatus including the quadriceps muscles, patellar tendon and tibial tuberosity.
20062723:39	If nonoperative treatment fails, surgical treatment should aim to correct the identified anatomical deficiencies . 
Trochleaplasty for recurrent patellar dislocation with associated trochlear dysplasia was first described in 1994 by Bereiter and Gautier . The surgical procedure consists of chiselling off the medial and lateral condyles together with the trochlea as one piece in a proximal to distal fashion . The osteochondral part remains fixed to the femur through a distally pedunculated flake.
20062723:40	The trochlear groove is then deepened, and the osteochondral flap is seated and fixed in the newly created groove.
20062723:41	Further soft tissue procedures aimed at enhancing patellofemoral stability may be required.
20062723:42	Recently, good long-term results have been reported, with no patients experiencing recurrence of dislocation .
20062723:43	However, the outcome with respect to patellofemoral pain was less predictable.
20062723:44	In the series described by Von Knoch et al. pre-operative pain was present in 78% of knees, and became worse in 33% of knees after trochleaplasty . The reported complications include patella baja and a tendency for patellar subluxation.
20062723:45	Alternatively, with trochlear osteotomy only the lateral trochlea is incompletely osteotomized and levered to raise the lateral articular surface 6-8 mm . The elevation of the lateral osteotomy is maintained by inserting a wedge shaped bone graft from the iliac crest with or without additional osteosynthesis.
20062723:46	Koëter et al. reported satisfactory 4-year follow-up results in 17 knees . Complications included subluxations in a patient with generalized hyperlaxity, and persistent pain in a patient who was subsequently treated with patellofemoral arthroplasty.
20062723:47	Others noted a high complication rate with 4 of 5 patients significantly improved after 7-years follow-up . 
Our patient had had a trochlear osteotomy with non-union and probably fracture of the osteochondral flake resulting in a painful patellofemoral joint with osteoarthritis.
20062723:48	Because of the deformation of the lateral condyle, patellofemoral joint preserving surgery was considered inadequate.
20062723:49	Total knee arthroplasty was considered too aggressive a treatment for what is, in effect, a disease confined to the anterior compartment.
20062723:50	Patellofemoral arthroplasty is a successful treatment option for patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis, with long-term outcomes in young patients similar to those achieved in older patients . 
We consider patellofemoral arthroplasty a salvage procedure for failed surgical treatment for trochlear dysplasia.

15960806:0	Background 
Whole-genome sequences of Arabidopsis and rice have provided a fundamental platform for the discovery of gene content and function in dicot and monocot plants.
15960806:1	Research on the model species has provided a wealth of knowledge on universal biochemical and genetic processes, as well as the development of analytical tools that are applicable to other plant species [ - ].
15960806:2	The availability of abundant, high-throughput sequence-based markers is the key for detailed genome-wide trait analysis.
15960806:3	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are the most common sequence variation and a significant amount of effort has been invested in resequencing alleles to discovery SNPs.
15960806:4	In fully sequenced small-genome model organisms SNP discovery is relatively straightforward, although high-throughput SNP discovery in natural populations remains both expensive and time-consuming . 
A number of recent studies have reported the use of oligonucleotide arrays, including expression arrays, for SNP detection in a highly parallel manner . In these studies, whole genomic DNA was demonstrated to work very well for simple organisms such as yeast , and even complex, albeit relatively small genomes, such as Arabidopsis .
15960806:5	However, the application of oligonucleotide arrays for SNP detection in large genomes, such as human, has relied on prior complexity reduction using PCR-based enrichment . The use of oligonucleotide arrays for simultaneous genotyping and gene-expression analysis using RNA target has also been reported in yeast . While there is arguably little need for enhanced SNP discovery in yeast, the real power of the approach came from coupling genotyping and gene expression analysis.
15960806:6	For large-genome species, including crops such as wheat and barley, full-genome sequences may not be available in the near future.
15960806:7	This has been compensated to some extent by model species that have allowed conserved biological processes to be studied.
15960806:8	However, while Arabidopsis and rice provide insights into universal genetic, structural and developmental processes, they fail to address many topics relevant to crop-plant species, such as yield, yield stability and quality.
15960806:9	Rice has a long history as a genetic model that has been strengthened by release of draft genome sequences . As a result of conservation of synteny at the genomic level it has been promoted as a model for the grasses .
15960806:10	However, unlike the temperate cereals such as wheat and barley, rice cultivation occurs under short days and rather specific environmental conditions, its end uses are distinct and numerous exceptions to conserved synteny have now emerged [ - ].
15960806:11	Together, these highlight the limitations of rice as a universal genetic model for the cereal grasses.
15960806:12	Wheat and barley together constitute one third of world cereal production . Barley in particular is cultivated throughout the world, in environments as diverse as arctic regions of Northern Europe, subtropical regions of Africa and the highlands of the Andes and the Himalayas . Barley breeding has created varieties tailored mainly for animal feed, malt production and human food . Ultimately, environmental and agronomical variation is based on genetic (sequence) diversity of the barley genome, with expression of agronomic traits closely linked to environmental adaptability.
15960806:13	With genome sizes of around 5,200 megabase pairs (Mbp) for barley  and around 16,100 Mbp for bread wheat  and genomic structure consisting of gene islands interspersed with highly repetitive retrotransposon sequences , access to sequence-based markers is currently provided through highly developed expressed sequence tag (EST) resources . 
The most important traits in crop species are generally polygenic.
15960806:14	These have traditionally been studied using biparental mapping populations and a large pool of mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and/or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers .
15960806:15	However, with the strong trend towards genome-wide association analyses based on linkage disequilibrium (LD)  there is a clear need for robust high-density and high-throughput markers that can be effectively deployed, often in closely related elite germplasm.
15960806:16	While the number and distribution of markers for LD studies in barley remains to be empirically determined, SNP markers offer both the sequence specificity and throughput necessary for the success of this approach.
15960806:17	SNP discovery in large-genome species is currently limited to identifying SNPs in silico in EST assemblies and resequencing of EST-derived unigenes in relevant germplasm , and scaling-up such approaches requires significant investment of both time and funding [ - ].
15960806:18	An approach that would allow parallel screening of the whole 'gene space' for SNPs is therefore highly desirable.
15960806:19	An Affymetrix GeneChip that allows simultaneous expression analysis of 22,000 transcripts has recently become available for barley . Transcription provides a native mechanism for the enrichment of gene sequences.
15960806:20	Polymorphisms present in DNA are transcribed into the messenger RNA and can potentially affect the hybridization to the GeneChip probes, if present in a region complementary to the probe.
15960806:21	Polymorphisms generated during mRNA processing, such as alternative splicing and polyadenylation, could also affect hybridization of the target RNA.
15960806:22	Here we report the use of the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip to identify single-feature polymorphisms (SFP), which include not only SNPs but also the processing polymorphisms mentioned above, in barley transcript profiling data from cultivars Morex and Golden Promise.
15960806:23	The statistical algorithm presented here allowed us to distinguish genotype-dependent hybridization differences at the probe level once overall gene-expression level was accounted for, leading to the identification of 10,504 SFPs.
15960806:24	Results 
Discussion 
Affymetrix GeneChips designed for gene-expression analysis can be utilized for genome-wide identification of sequence polymorphisms . Whole-genome DNA has been used as a hybridization target in yeast  and in Arabidopsis  to identify SFPs using expression arrays.
15960806:25	While such an approach was valid in yeast and a small-genome model plant, the transfer of this approach to cereal crop plants with up to 100-fold larger genome sizes is problematic.
15960806:26	The number of genes in barley is likely to be comparable to the estimated number of genes in Arabidopsis and rice .
15960806:27	However, the amount of repetitive DNA in barley will dilute the gene-specific signal in the target labelled DNA.
15960806:28	Until now, PCR-based artificial enrichment for a subset of sequences has been used to tackle the complexity of large genomes [ , ].
15960806:29	Using RNA as a hybridization target provides a natural way of enriching for gene sequences while maintaining all the sequence diversity present in transcribed sequences.
15960806:30	However, sequence polymorphism effects on hybridization are concealed within the overall variation in gene-expression levels and tissue-dependent and genotype-dependent differential gene expression.
15960806:31	Additional complexity comes from posttranscriptional sequence polymorphisms, such as alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation.
15960806:32	New array designs that tile probes across genes and intergenic regions will help unravel this complexity as nucleotide polymorphisms may affect single features while alternative transcripts may more often affect adjacent features.
15960806:33	We present here a statistical approach that allows us to reliably discern the probe-level differential hybridization between two genotypes that is often caused by sequence polymorphisms once variation in overall gene-expression level is normalized.
15960806:34	Our approach allows the use of expression array data generated from different tissue types, and thus increases its versatility and applicability to the wide range of currently available oligonucleotide microarray data.
15960806:35	The analysis algorithm was applied to gene-expression microarray data generated from two barley genotypes with six tissue types each for a total of 36 array hybridizations.
15960806:36	At a stringent 0.1% FDR, 10,504 SFPs were identified.
15960806:37	Comparison to the available sequence-verified SNP data suggested that 67% of the known SNPs were predicted, confirming a good sensitivity. Approximately 40% of the SFP probes that were sequence-verified did not reveal any polymorphisms at the sequence level; thus, the FDR was up to 13-fold higher compared to the rate for Arabidopsis genomic DNA hybridizations . The higher false-positive rates can be at least partly explained by variation in mRNA structure (for example, alternative splicing and polyadenylation) between tissues, and possibly between genotypes, which would lead to differential hybridization to probes but could not be detected by sequencing.
15960806:38	A recent study using an EST collection concluded that at least 4% of barley genes may undergo alternative splicing ; however, more experimental data may be required to correctly model the rate of probe level variation in plant gene-expression data.
15960806:39	For practical application the balance between the cost of replicates and the number of replicates necessary to maintain sensitivity is important.
15960806:40	We therefore analyzed the microarray data comparing just three replicates of each tissue type from the two genotypes (Table ).
15960806:41	Overall sensitivity decreased, but remained above 50%.
15960806:42	Remarkably, the false SNP discovery rate was better for single tissue comparisons, probably because variation in mRNA transcript processing among tissues was eliminated.
15960806:43	Certain molecular marker applications require the precise nature of sequence changes to be known.
15960806:44	The conventional approach to SNP discovery is based on resequencing alleles, which is particularly inefficient if the polymorphism levels are low.
15960806:45	Prescreening for polymorphisms using, for example, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)  or Eco-TILLING , allows a reduction in sequencing costs, but these approaches are time-consuming, relatively expensive and rely on PCR.
15960806:46	SFP detection in gene-expression microarray data allows parallel screening of a large proportion of all the organisms' gene space in one experiment.
15960806:47	The stringency of SFP calls can also be adjusted for a particular application, that is, decreasing stringency will result in additional calls at the expense of higher false-positive rates.
15960806:48	Gene-expression levels are currently being treated as quantitative traits and transcript abundance variation is being mapped as quantitative trait loci (QTL) . Incorporating SFP effects into calculations will improve accuracy of gene-expression studies and will facilitate correct assessment of allele-specific gene-expression differences.
15960806:49	Furthermore, an SFP identified in a coding region of a gene that is differentially expressed in an allele-specific manner represents a marker linked to the regulatory regions of the gene, and as such may help distinguish between cis and trans effects in allele-specific gene expression [ - ].

21331187:0	INTRODUCTION 
Diltiazem hydrochloride (DH) is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes vascular smooth muscle and dilates coronary arteries by altering the calcium flux into the cell.
21331187:1	It has been used widely in the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
21331187:2	Conventional oral dosage forms of DH are intended to administer dose of 30 mg for four times a day or 60 mg thrice a day.
21331187:3	Thus, attempts have been made to develop twice a day of oral sustained release dosage formulation for achieving better patient compliance and relative constant blood levels.
21331187:4	It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism.
21331187:5	The systemic bioavailability of the immediate-release preparation is approximately 40%-50%, with an elimination half-life of 3.5-7 h.
21331187:6	Sustained-release DH has been reported to reduce tachycardia without inducing excessive bradycardia and does not significantly reduce baseline heart rate below 74 beats/min.
21331187:7	Because of its low bioavailability and short half-life attempts have been made to develop sustained release products and a reduced dosing frequency.
21331187:8	In the last few decades, many types of peroral-modified/controlled release formulations have been developed to decrease dosing frequency and enhance patient compliance, reduce fluctuation in circular drug levels, facilitate a more uniform effect, and improve the clinical efficacy of the drug.
21331187:9	These formulations are designed to deliver the drugs at a controlled and predetermined rate, thus maintaining their therapeutically effective concentrations in the systemic circulations for prolonged periods of time.
21331187:10	There are a few reports on the formulation of oral-controlled release products of diltiazem employing coated beads, pan coating, microencapsulation, and complexation.
21331187:11	But due to growing interest in the development of homogeneous monolithic drug delivery system for various routes of administration, a very attractive type of dosage form like ‘microspheres’ is required.
21331187:12	Microspheres are solid approximately spherical particles ranging from 1 to 100 mm in size to provide advantages over sustained release tablets such as ready distribution over a large surface area, predictable and reproducible drug release kinetics, delocalization of total dose in GIT, reduced side effects of drug, and independent drug release rate on gastric transit time.
21331187:13	Oral multi-unit dosage forms like microspheres have received much attention as modified/controlled drug delivery systems to attribute more uniformly in the gastro-intestine tract, thus resulting more uniform drug absorption and reducing patient-to-patient variability.
21331187:14	The multi-particulate systems can be filled into hard gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets.
21331187:15	It has been reported that the selection of the proper microencapsulation technique and of the excipients, such as polymers as carriers, coaters, and emulsifiers, is very popular in the preparation of the modified release microspheres of the drug.
21331187:16	In last few years, a number of studies have been made on the compression of microparticles, such as microspheres, microcapsules, and microsponges into tablets, and the effects of excipients and of the compression on the drug release rate from these formulations have been investigated.
21331187:17	However, not a single study has been done on the filling of the matrix type microspheres of DH as compared to few studies on the tableting of the matrix type microspheres of DH.
21331187:18	Natural biodegradable polymeric-based microspheres as a drug carrier are widely used as they improve the safety and efficacy of drug delivery, drug targeting to specific cells or organs, and better patient compliance.
21331187:19	Egg albumin can be used as a carrier for microsphere formulation of drugs as it has properties of protein binding and physical entrapment, the passive and facilitated release process of various types of incorporated drugs from the albumin matrix.
21331187:20	To overcome rapid dissolution of highly soluble polymer ‘egg albumin’ in aqueous environment, different cross-linking methods have been used for microsphere preparation.
21331187:21	Ethylcellulose, which is one of the most widely used water-insoluble polymers, in modified release dosage forms, was chosen as the matrix-forming polymer due to its good compressibility, excellent physicochemical stability, and minimum toxicity.
21331187:22	Hence, the purpose of the present research was to develop microspheres of DH to reduce its dosing frequency using egg albumin as a biodegradable, biocompatible carrier and an ethylcellulose as a coating polymer by the w/o emulsion thermal cross-linking method with a goal of delivering the same dose of the drug through microspheres in a capsule taken once rather than two or three times a day.
21331187:23	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
CONCLUSION 
From the present investigation it was concluded that ethylcellulose-coated egg albumin microsphere, can be considered as an effectively coated carrier for the design of a controlled drug delivery system of highly water-soluble DH.
20976291:0	Introduction 
Many animals use signals to communicate their social status to conspecifics (Fugle et al. ; Senar and Camerino ; Molles and Vehrencamp ; Martín et al. ), and these signals may allow individuals to perceive each other's status while avoiding costly fights (Rohwer ).
20976291:1	Many status signals appear inexpensive to produce (Horn et al. ), and the social control hypothesis suggests that social interactions maintain the evolutionary stability of status signals (Rohwer ; Maynard Smith and Harper ; Tibbetts and Dale ).
20976291:2	Cheating is limited because signalers often test one another, and subordinates that exaggerate their status become involved in costly fights they cannot win.
20976291:3	Thus, social control ensures honest signaling because low-quality individuals signal at a low level to prevent high-quality individuals from “punishing” them.
20976291:4	Originally formulated to explain plumage variation in flocks of wintering birds (Rohwer ), the social control hypothesis may also explain honest signaling in a mating context.
20976291:5	In three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) and red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ), males reduce their signal expression when in the presence of superior competitors (Candolin ; Parker and Ligon ), and this may allow females to identify high-quality mates.
20976291:6	Because the social control hypothesis suggests that social interactions can contribute to honest sexual signaling, this hypothesis is similar to indicator models (Zahavi ) in which the evolutionary stability of honest mating signals is maintained by the costs of producing or maintaining them.
20976291:7	Bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchidae) are a unique system for studies of the social control of mating signals.
20976291:8	Males of most species build and decorate stick structures, called bowers, to attract the females with whom they mate.
20976291:9	Females prefer to mate with males that own well-decorated and well-constructed bowers (Borgia ; Uy and Borgia ; Madden ; Coleman et al. ), though other male and bower characteristics may also influence female choice (Loffredo and Borgia ; Coleman et al. ; Robson et al. ).
20976291:10	Because bower decorations are external to the birds, males can rapidly change the size of their mating signals, and in Spotted Bowerbirds ( Ptilonorhynchus maculatus ), low-quality males reject decorations added to their bowers, most likely to prevent rivals from destroying their bowers completely (Madden ).
20976291:11	Because low-quality males reduced their signal expression to prevent “punishment” from rivals, these results suggest that social control facilitates honest sexual signaling.
20976291:12	However, the honesty of male mating signals in bowerbirds could also be influenced by a different form of male–male competition: decoration theft.
20976291:13	In satin bowerbirds ( Ptilonorhynchus violaceus ), there was a positive correlation between the number of decorations at a male's bower and the number of decorations he stole from other males (Borgia and Gore ; Wojcieszek et al. ), and in great bowerbirds ( Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis ), the number of decorations at a male's bower was related to the male's ability to prevent theft from his own bower (Doerr ).
20976291:14	Thus, honest sexual signaling may result from direct competition over resources (decoration theft hypothesis) rather than from a male's signaling restraint (social control hypothesis).
20976291:15	Additional studies are needed in a single species to quantify the relative importance of decoration theft and socially controlled signals and to identify the environmental conditions that may favor one form of male–male competition over another.
20976291:16	In this study, I examined whether the numbers of decorations at bowers are socially controlled in the great bowerbird.
20976291:17	First, I supplemented males with decorations to determine whether they rejected supplemental decorations.
20976291:18	If the numbers of decorations at bowers are socially controlled, then males should reject most decorations added to their bowers, and there should be a positive correlation between the numbers of decorations at bowers before and after supplementation.
20976291:19	Next, I supplemented males with decorations to determine whether they experienced increased bower destruction from rivals.
20976291:20	If decoration numbers are socially controlled, then bower destruction should increase during supplementation, and males that naturally have few decorations should experience a greater increase in destruction rate when supplemented than males that naturally have many decorations.
20976291:21	Because a previous study suggests that decoration theft may facilitate honest signaling in this species (Doerr ), I also documented the occurrence of decoration theft and examined how this affects the interpretation that decoration numbers at bowers are socially controlled.
20976291:22	Finally, I conducted these experiments in two populations, one in which objects of potential use as decorations were relatively common in the environment and one in which they were relatively rare, so I also discuss whether environmental conditions may favor one form of male–male competition over another.
19479275:0	Introduction 
Heart rate variability (HRV) is related to lifestyle in adults.
19479275:1	Regular physical exercise in adults has beneficial effect on autonomic control of the heart, with decreased resting heart rate often accompanied with increase in HRV (Hottenrott et al. ; Tuomainen et al. ). Disturbed sleeping patterns or lack of sleep effect HRV.
19479275:2	Shift workers and patients with sleep apnoea have deranged HRV (Furlan et al. ; Gula et al. ). Smoking impairs the sympatho-vagal balance and decreases the HRV in healthy adults (Alyan et al. ; Karakaya et al. ) and in heavy smokers vagal modulation of the heart is blunted (Barutcu et al. ). 
In adolescent HRV decreases with augmented BMI (Rabbia et al. ) as it does with blood glucose levels (Singh et al. ) and risk factor influence on autonomic heart rate control is present before manifest cardiovascular disease (Jensen-Urstad et al. ).
19479275:3	The relationship between HRV and lifestyle is not well studied in children and adolescents and it is not known at what age the relationship is established.
19479275:4	There is a modification of HRV with age, which reflects the evolution of the autonomic nervous system (Silvetti et al. ). LF, HF and total power increase from 0–6 years, followed by a decrease to adulthood (Finley and Nugent ).
19479275:5	Early life individual differences in HRV can be explained by hereditary factors (Singh et al. ), diabetic neuropathy (Colhoun et al. ) or an underdeveloped ANS in prematurely born children (Longin et al. ). 
Decreased HRV is associated with risk for cardiac events in adults (Tsuji et al. ) and is a predictor of imminent hypertension (Schroeder et al. ; Singh et al. ).
19479275:6	A decreased HRV is related to an increased risk of death and HRV could have a predictive value for life expectancy and health (Tsuji et al. ).
19479275:7	Our hypothesis is that HRV changes due to lifestyle factors precedes or parallels the development of cardiovascular disorders, i.e. it should present also in healthy adolescents, where long-term effects of poor lifestyle has not yet generated manifest cardiovascular disease.
19479275:8	To this end we investigated whether there is an impact of lifestyle (physical activity, eating habits, sleeping pattern and smoking) on autonomic heart rate control in healthy adolescents, i.e. at an age when lifestyle-associated cardiovascular disorders are not yet frequent.
19479275:9	The impacts of cardiovascular risk factors (systolic blood pressure, p-glucose and BMI) on HRV were also studied.
19479275:10	Methods 
High school students (66 girls and 33 boys) with mean age 16.5 years at the first measurement (age range 15 years 11 months–17 years 7 months) constituted the original sample.
19479275:11	The subjects were recruited from high schools: in a small rural town, in the Stockholm city, in a northern affluent suburb and in a less affluent southern suburb with a large immigrant population.
19479275:12	The first author met the students and gave oral and written information about the study and an informed consent form was signed by the student and at least one parent.
19479275:13	The measurements had the same order in all subjects.
19479275:14	The measurements were repeated after 6 months to evaluate the stability of the intra-individual HRV.
19479275:15	When both measurements were completed, the students were offered two cinema tickets each.
19479275:16	About 80% of the students informed participated and no one was denied participation.
19479275:17	The participation ratio was similar for all schools.
19479275:18	The main reasons to decline participation were fear of blood sampling and not wanting to miss school hours.
19479275:19	Exclusion criteria were diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and more than 5% missing or distorted data in any registered HRV segment.
19479275:20	The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet.
19479275:21	The measurements were carried out at the school nurses offices by four nurses and one physician.
19479275:22	The subjects were sitting upright, in silence and no body movements were allowed during the procedure.
19479275:23	None of the subjects had clinical signs or symptoms of infectious disease.
19479275:24	Use of tobacco or intake of tea, coffee, caffeine containing soft drinks or beta stimulant asthma medication was not allowed 1 h prior to the measurements.
19479275:25	The HRV registration was preceded by 15 min of rest.
19479275:26	HRV was measured during 2 min × 2, in between which blood pressure was checked.
19479275:27	This was a modified version of a 12-min protocol (von Scheele et al. ). 
SDNN was used as a time domain measure and HF and LF as frequency domain measures.
19479275:28	In spectral analyses variability distributes as a function of frequency (Camm ).
19479275:29	HF (0.15–0.4 Hz) is related to vagal activity and includes the respiratory sinus arrhythmia when the breathing rate is normal.
19479275:30	LF (0.04–0.15
19479275:31	Hz) is a quantitative marker for sympathetic modulations, but in some studies it is viewed as reflecting both sympathetic and vagal activity (Berntson et al. ).
19479275:32	The equipment was a I-330-C-2 Physiological Monitoring System (J&J Engineering; Poulsbo, WA), and c-Stress customized software (PBM Systems, Stockholm, Sweden).
19479275:33	The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from electrodes placed on the left and right wrist with a sampling rate of 1,024 Hz.
19479275:34	Inter-beat intervals were calculated online using an R-wave peak detection algorithm and stored on a PC for off-line processing.
19479275:35	Fourier analysis was performed on 2-min segments of detrended data passed through a Hamming window.
19479275:36	The HRV mean values were logarithmically transformed.
19479275:37	Inter-beat intervals were scanned manually for ectopic beats and artefacts, which were replaced with cubic spline interpolation.
19479275:38	Lifestyle was self-reported in a form with five-point scales.
19479275:39	Sleeping patterns were described by frequency of going to bed later than midnight (“never”, “seldom”, “1 time/week”, “2 times/week”, “>2 times per week”), food habits by the frequency of missing breakfast and/or lunch (“never”, “seldom”, “1-2 days/week”, “3–4 days/week” or “every day”), physical exercise by the frequency of exercising with hard breathing and sweating (“never”, “seldom”, “once a week”, “twice a week” and “more than twice a week”).
19479275:40	Smoking was defined as daily smoking or not.
19479275:41	Socio-demographic data was represented by school, number of parents in the household, parent unemployment and parent ethnicity.
19479275:42	Capillary p-glucose and b-haemoglobin were analysed with a portable Heamocue Glucose and Haemoglobin System (Banauch et al. ; Vanzetti ). Weight and length were measured and BMI calculated.
19479275:43	The same equipment was used throughout the whole study for measuring weight and blood pressure.
19479275:44	Results 
Discussion 
The main finding of the present study was that self-reported physical activity but not eating habits, sleeping patterns or smoking predicted HF, LF and SDNN and heart rate in a healthy study population of adolescents.
19479275:45	Of the cardiovascular risk factors only p-glucose showed a weak but significant prediction power for LF in the second measurement, but BMI and systolic blood pressure did not predict HRV.
19479275:46	No main effects were noted for gender except that heart rate was significantly lower in boys.
19479275:47	SDNN showed no gender difference in the present study, but data are being reported as higher in adolescent boys compared to girls (Silvetti et al. ).
19479275:48	However, the present data was in line with the Silvetti study in that boys had a lower heart rate and that vagus-associated parameters of HRV showed no gender differences.
19479275:49	In adults regular aerobic exercise results in reduction in heart rate, reflecting an increase in autonomic efferent activity with enhanced vagal influence on the cardiac rhythm (Hottenrott et al. ).
19479275:50	This is in line with the present findings of adolescents.
19479275:51	The effect of physical exercise on different HRV parameters is less clear-cut in previous studies.
19479275:52	Low to moderate intensity exercise is associated with favourable changes in HRV in middle aged men (Tuomainen et al. ), but limited influence of physical training on HRV has also been reported (Buchheit and Gindre ).
19479275:53	High intensity intermittent training in children during 7 weeks does not affect HRV (Gamelin et al. ). Physical activity in the present study is self-reported as a lifestyle parameter and probably reflects a longer duration of regular training than 7 weeks, which may explain the impact on HRV.
19479275:54	Sleeping patterns are not related to HRV, which is in contrast to what has been reported in adult samples (Furlan et al. ).
19479275:55	This may reflect that our sleep measure was less directed towards sleep deprivation and rather measured a shift in diurnal rhythm.
19479275:56	The fact that smoking did not correlate to HRV may be a lack of sensitivity, as the subjects were few and had not smoked for extended periods, combined with the low reliability in self-reported tobacco use in this age group (Hennrikus et al. ).
19479275:57	The lack of correlations between BMI and systolic blood pressure versus HRV are also probably due to lack of sensitivity, as few subjects suffered from obesity or hypertension in the sample.
19479275:58	Multiple regression models in the second measurements showed a weak predictive power of p-glucose on LF.
19479275:59	Our data support (Faulkner et al. ) in that HRV data allows for the early identification of subclinical cardiac autonomic changes in youth.
19479275:60	The inferential power of the study is limited by that the sample encompassed only of 99 subjects, that we had some loss of data and the group did not represent a fully randomised population sample.
19479275:61	However, the repeated measures design demonstrated that the reported regressions were robust within the sample.
19479275:62	The present findings support that even a short registration without any standardised interventions can capture HRV differences of possible predictive and clinical value.
19479275:63	Five-minute Holter recordings in a non-laboratory setting has been shown to be stable over 2 months and generate individually characteristic HRV data (Sinnreich et al. ).
19479275:64	Our data show stable results with 4-min registrations over a period of 6 months.
19479275:65	The registering of HRV only during 4 min (and not 24 h) has obvious advantages for screening purposes.
19479275:66	The HRV measurement device is portable and easily managed.
19479275:67	In conclusion, we have reported that HRV is related to self-reported physical activity in adolescents and thereby life style factors influence HRV at an age preceding the development of manifest lifestyle-related cardiovascular disorders.
19479275:68	Within the age range of 15 years and 11 months to 17 years and 7 months, physical activity, but not sleeping pattern, eating habits or smoking was a predictor for HF, LF and SDNN.
19479275:69	Of the cardiovascular risk factors, only p-glucose showed a weak predictive power for LF on one occasion.
19479275:70	Whether the impact of physical exercise on HRV in adolescents is associated with a prognostic benefit regarding overall mortality, needs to be studied further.
19479275:71	It would be of interest to target the impact of increased physical activity in young individuals with high exposure to known risk factors for cardiovascular disease using both HRV and future morbidity as endpoints.
19479275:72	The present findings support that an ambulatory short registration of HRV can have possible predictive and clinical value.

21234414:1	Introduction 
Diabetes Mellitus is one of the leading causes of death, illness, and economic loss in the United States . Not surprisingly, an extensive amount of research is ongoing which is directed at the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of this crippling disorder . Animal experimentation has a long history in the field of diabetes research.
21234414:2	To induce diabetes in animals, toxic chemicals such as streptozotocin  and alloxan  are popularly used.
21234414:3	Transgenic rodent models of diabetes are gaining popularity.
21234414:4	A major criticism of using rodents is that, due to their short life span, they may not develop the clinical complications seen in humans that have been diabetic for a number of years.
21234414:5	Cats, dogs, swine, and nonhuman primates are occasionally used . Rabbits are a potentially overlooked, manageable species for chronic diabetes experiments.
21234414:6	They are considered lower on the phylogenetic scale than cats, dogs, swine, and nonhuman primates, and they have an average life-span of 5–8 years which is significantly longer than rodents.
21234414:7	Studies have demonstrated that rabbits possess characteristics desirable in a laboratory animal model including convenient size, longer life span, strain specific, have good temperaments, are easily handled and are relatively inexpensive . We searched PubMed and in the past decade more than 1000 studies have been conducted using rabbits as a model of diabetes .
21234414:8	However, most of these experiments used rabbits that were diabetic for only several weeks to 2 months . Studies of these durations have severely limited diabetic research capabilities as many complications of diabetes require years to develop . In this study, we created a long-term rabbit model of type 1 diabetes mellitus with reasonably good health for experimental usage for one year or longer.
21234414:9	This paper reports our management strategies and physical, biochemical, and histological findings of these rabbits.
21234414:10	2.
21234414:11	Methods 
The study was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in research, and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville, an AAALAC accredited program.
21234414:12	A total of 32 young (8–10 weeks, 2.13 ± 0.24 kg), male New Zealand white rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus (Myrtle's Rabbitry, Thompson Station, TN) were divided into two groups.
21234414:13	The first group consisted of 20 animals with chemically induced type 1 diabetes mellitus; the second group consisted of 12 age-matched control (orthoglycemic) animals.
21234414:14	Animals were singly housed in stainless steel caging with slotted floors (40 × 60 × 80 cm) in a temperature (16–22°C) and humidity (30–70%) controlled room on a 12 : 12 hour light : dark cycle.
21234414:15	Cage pans were cleaned three times per week and cage racks were cleaned once weekly.
21234414:16	Laboratory Rabbit Diet HF 5326 (LabDiet, PMI Nutrition International) supplemented with certified timothy hay cubes (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) and filtered tap water was provided ad libitum through an automated watering system from arrival throughout the end of the study.
21234414:17	Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of fresh vegetables at least once weekly, dumbbells and stainless steel rattles (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ).
21234414:18	Vendor microbiological monitoring health reports indicated that the rabbits were serologically negative for the following pathogens: CAR Bacillus, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Pasteurella multocida, Treponema cuniculi, and Oral Papilloma Virus.
21234414:19	The rabbits were also negative for Bordetella bronchiseptica, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and Clostridium piliformis.
21234414:20	Animals were free of internal and external parasites.
21234414:21	Before any experimental manipulations were initiated the rabbits were allowed to acclimate for at least 7 days.

4. Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is by far the largest group of diabetic rabbits kept for one year or longer for scientific research.
21234414:24	A long-term diabetic animal model has many potential benefits.
21234414:25	Our experience has shown that, with careful management, alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits can be kept for one year or longer in reasonably good health.
21234414:26	The biochemical and histological changes indicated well-developed diabetes.
21234414:27	Many studies have been conducted in diabetic rabbits over short periods of time in the past several decades.
21234414:28	However, short-term diabetic rabbits have severely limited the diabetic research capabilities because human diabetes lasts for decades and many diabetic complications take years to develop.
21234414:29	A PubMed search revealed only a few reports in which diabetic rabbits were kept alive for 3–6 months for pharmacology or growth factor studies  . Only one article was found in which 3 rabbits were kept for 12 months to study the aortic intima-media of alloxan-diabetic rabbits . Due to many medical complications, the management of long-term diabetic rabbits is labor intensive, expensive, and technically demanding which reduces the incentive to perform these studies over long periods of time.
21234414:30	The toxin-induced diabetic rabbits were first administrated alloxan by Dunn and Mcletchie  who by studying the crush syndrome in rabbits investigated the effects of a series of uric acid derivatives including alloxan with regard to kidney damage.
21234414:31	The animals which received alloxan became comatose after 12 hours, and were hypothermic with high blood urea and low blood glucose values.
21234414:32	Shortly after the injection there was a marked hyperglycemia.
21234414:33	Histological examination revealed early signs of expected kidney damage.
21234414:34	An unexpected finding was a partial or total necrosis of the pancreatic islets.
21234414:35	Other tissues showed no damage, and alloxan was gradually adopted to generate diabetes in animals.
21234414:36	Over the course of our study, alloxan-induced diabetic animals exhibited classic symptoms of human diabetes, such as hyperglycemia, glucosuria, polydipsia, and polyuria, loss of body weight despite polyphagia, hyperlipemia, ketonuria, and acidosis.
21234414:37	Following the administration of alloxan there is a characteristic response in blood glucose level . In the first 2 hours, blood glucose rises.
21234414:38	This transient hyperglycemia is thought to be due to sudden glycogen breakdown in the liver . The reason for the breakdown of liver glycogen during this phase is unknown, but may be a secondary effect of epinephrine release.
21234414:39	The second phase is a hypoglycemic phase which may be severe enough to lead to death if it is not prevented or treated with supplemental glucose . The hypoglycemia is due to a sudden outpouring of insulin from dying beta cells . The hypoglycemia generally appears after 6 hours . Hypoglycemia is more pronounced in fasted animals . 
The susceptibility to both toxic and diabetogenic doses of alloxan varies widely not only in different species but also among animals of the same species .
21234414:40	The range of the safe diabetogenic dose of alloxan in a particular animal is quite narrow and even light overdosing may be toxic and result in death.
21234414:41	This loss is likely due to kidney tubular cell necrotic toxicity, in particular when high doses of alloxan are administered .
21234414:42	The dose of alloxan (100 mg/kg) utilized in this study is diabetogenic and less toxic.
21234414:43	However, this dose does not necessarily produce stable diabetes in rabbits . Sixty percent of the rabbits in this study required a second dose of alloxan to maintain persistent hyperglycemia, and all of these animals survived until the end of the experiment.
21234414:44	The recovery from diabetes has been proposed to be the consequence of either a multiplication of beta cells that survive the initial alloxan injection or the formation of new beta-cells from the duct epithelium of the exocrine portion of pancreas . Another possible explanation is that there may have been a stress-induced hyperglycemia at the time of the initial alloxan injection initiated by handling of the animals.
21234414:45	It has been shown that hyperglycemia can provide protection against alloxan-induced injury .
21234414:46	It has also been shown that male rabbits are more likely to experience stress-induced hyperglycemia than female rabbits  and this may have contributed to the high percentage of rabbits requiring a second dose of alloxan.
21234414:47	In future studies we plan to measure the blood glucose level of the rabbits immediately prior to the administration of alloxan to be able to better predict those animals that may require a second dose of alloxan as well as increase the amount of handling that they receive during the acclimation period in an attempt to decrease the percentage of rabbits that require a second dose.
21234414:48	Since untreated diabetics have higher complication rates than regulated diabetics, we chose to treat the rabbits in this study with insulin to increase the survival time of the rabbits, but we did not fully regulate the diabetes.
21234414:49	Normal blood glucose levels were maintained a mean of 8 hours per day, and a hyperglycemic state was maintained for a mean of 16 hours per day.
21234414:50	Therefore this model may more closely represent a model of poorly regulated diabetes because glucose fluctuation has been shown to cause more tissue damage than stable hyperglycemia .
21234414:51	Based on the severity of hyperglycemia, we divided the rabbits into three groups, those that had mild, moderately severe, and severe diabetes.
21234414:52	Each group exhibited certain characteristic physiologic changes throughout the course of the study.
21234414:53	In the mild diabetic group, body weights increased rather quickly, the biochemical values were usually in the normal range, the animals BG returned to levels <300 mg/dl and they required a second injection of alloxan.
21234414:54	In the severe diabetic group, body weights increased very slowly and biochemical values were mostly abnormal including elevated BUN, anemia due to renal dysfunction , dyslipidemia , and at times ketoacidosis . In the moderately severe diabetic group, the changes observed were a combination of the above two groups and their blood glucose levels were more manageable.
21234414:55	In addition to hyperglycemia in the long-term diabetic rabbits, we observed other characteristics of diabetes.
21234414:56	While all of the rabbits in this study gained body weight, the gain in the diabetic rabbits was less than the gain observed in the age-matched animals.
21234414:57	Prior to alloxan administration, their body weights ranged from 2.0 to 2.5 
21234414:58	kg.
21234414:59	After one year, they only increased to 3.5–4.0 kg, a weight comparable to a normal 4-5-month old rabbit.
21234414:60	However, the body weight of age-matched nondiabetic rabbits in this study increased to more than 5.0 kg after one year which is consistent with the normal growth rate provided by the vendor.
21234414:61	The increase in body weight in this study, albeit small, appeared to be different from many of the previous studies in which diabetic rabbits lose weight.
21234414:62	A large number of previous studies utilized rabbits that were 3-4 months of age and were considered to be young adults.
21234414:63	Our finding of an increase in body weight is similar to that reported by Goseki et al.  who utilized young rabbits that were 10 weeks of age similar to those used in our study.
21234414:64	Because body weight change is a reflection of whole body function, maintenance of appropriate body weight might be an important factor for the rabbits to survive long-term in the diabetic state.
21234414:65	Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased in all diabetic rabbits in this study.
21234414:66	These findings are in agreement with previously published studies . We also found a few diabetic animals that suffered from anemia.
21234414:67	These rabbits all had poor renal function, which is similar to clinical human patients due to a decrease in erythropoietin production by the damaged kidneys . 
 The histological changes observed in animals kept for one year were typical of diabetic damage.
21234414:68	In addition to pancreatic islet damage, microscopic cross-sections of the pancreatic arteries showed thickening of vessel walls which indicates atherosclerosis in this organ.
21234414:69	In the aorta, microscopic sections of the aortic media demonstrated mild spot calcifications in small areas which are also indicative of atherosclerosis.
21234414:70	Similar changes were also seen in the kidney, in which the afferent glomerular arteriole wall was markedly thickened and the lumen was narrowed.
21234414:71	Glomerular atrophy was also present in the kidney.
21234414:72	In the liver, lipid accumulated in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes as vacuoles.
21234414:73	All of these histological changes are consistent with those seen in long-term diabetics which may not be present in animals that are diabetic for shorter periods of time.
21234414:74	One of the most common complications of human diabetes is ulceration of the extremities, which has been subjected to numerous experimental studies.
21234414:75	However, all of these studies suffer from several limitations that make it difficult to extrapolate animal results to clinical settings.
21234414:76	One is the time during which the animal has been diabetic, and another is the etiology of diabetic ulcers.
21234414:77	It is well known that human diabetic ulcers are the result of years, even decades of diabetes mellitus.
21234414:78	Neuropathy, vasculopathy, immune dysfunction, and biochemical abnormalities all contribute to the development of chronic wounds in diabetic patients . To date, none of the animal models used for diabetic wound research have all of the same features of human diabetic wounds with the exception of hyperglycemia.
21234414:79	The length of time that rabbits have been maintained in a hyperglycemic state in the majority of rabbit wound healing studies has been very limited, with the shortest being several days and the longest being two months.
21234414:80	These short periods of persistent hyperglycemia simply cannot reproduce the changes observed in human diabetes.
21234414:81	In order to test whether the time of hyperglycemia had any effect on wound healing, we compared wound healing times in diabetic rabbits and age-matched nondiabetic animals at two weeks and one year.
21234414:82	To date little is known about the difference between wound healing in short-term hyperglycemia and long-term diabetes . In the present study, short-term hyperglycemia (2 weeks) appeared to delay the healing process to a degree as compared to nondiabetic rabbits, but this difference was not statistically significant.
21234414:83	However, in the one-year diabetic rabbits, the closure time of wounds was significantly longer than age-matched nondiabetic wounds.
21234414:84	Our results appear to indicate that wound healing time is proportionate to the length of diabetic times.
21234414:85	A state of systemic hyperglycemia, as seen in diabetes, may influence wound closure in numerous ways.
21234414:86	Several hypotheses have been described in the literature such as the formation of glycation end products , hyperosmolarity , and altered insulin signaling in various ways .
21234414:87	However, hyperglycemia alone plays a limited role in the status of many nonhealing chronic wounds, while other pathophysiological changes take much longer to develop.
21234414:88	If a rabbit's life span is 5–8 years, one year may be comparable to 15–20 years of human life, although such an approximation is an oversimplification.
21234414:89	The biochemical and histological changes found in this study provide some evidence to mimic human diabetic changes; an animal model that is diabetic for a longer period of time than that which is more commonly published provides more features closer to human diabetic changes.
21234414:90	In summary, with careful management which includes adaptive and repeated injections of alloxan, accurate adjustment of insulin dose, monitoring body weight and biochemical values, performing blood glucose curves, and adjusting insulin dosage as soon as animals exhibit abnormal symptoms, alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits can be kept for one year or longer in reasonably good health.
21234414:91	Such a model may prove useful in scientific research on diabetes.
21851698:0	Introduction 
Botulism is caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe.
21851698:1	Botulinum toxin is an exotoxin produced during the growth and autolysis phase of the organism under anaerobic conditions . Eight known botulinum toxins, A, B, Ca, Cb, D, E, F and G, have been identified.
21851698:2	Disease in cattle is produced primarily by types C and D.
21851698:3	Clostridium botulinum types C and D produce potent toxins in carrion, feed contaminated with dead rodents, birds or reptiles, or any rotting material [ , ].
21851698:4	This study is the first confirmation, by direct toxin isolation, of Clostridium botulinum type C and Clostridium botulinum type D in cattle, in Turkey.
21851698:5	Materials and methods 
The study was conducted on a Holstein Friesian breeding farm near the town of Bandirma in Balikesir.
21851698:6	The herd consisted of 105 cattle.
21851698:7	Clinically, 26 cattle including milking cows were found to be suffering from different degrees of suspected botulism.
21851698:8	They ranged in age from four to eight years and had been ill for between two and eight days.
21851698:9	A routine clinical examination of the animals, including body temperature, pulse, respiratory rates and ruminal movements, was performed.
21851698:10	The neurological examination included an assessment of each affected animal's mental status, gait, pupillary light reflexes, anal reflexes, tongue reflexes, swallowing reflexes, tail tone and sensitivity to pricking with a needle.
21851698:11	In the detailed history, the owner reported that the milking cows' feed, in addition to grain, haylage and silage, included ensiled poultry litter.
21851698:12	It was reported that dry cows, heifers and calves were unaffected.
21851698:13	These animals were fed different rations, without poultry litter.
21851698:14	Routine haematological values, including haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocyte, total white cell and platelet counts, were determined by a haemocell counter (Cell Dyn 3500; Abbott Inc., USA).
21851698:15	The concentrations of serum urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine kinase (CK) and, potassium (K) were assessed (Reflotron; Boehringer&Monnheim Inc., Germany).
21851698:16	The levels of total protein, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were determined in serum by spectrophotometer (Labospec; Germany).
21851698:17	As a first step in the definitive diagnosis of botulism, ruminal contents and serum from all affected animals and their feed materials were collected, immediately cooled and frozen as soon as possible.
21851698:18	In addition, the contents of the small and large intestines were sampled from five dead animals.
21851698:19	Samples were sent to the Veterinary Control and Research Institute (Pendik, Istanbul).
21851698:20	A definitive diagnosis was performed by mouse inoculation test, as described by , on samples of feed material including grain, haylage, silage, ensiled poultry litter, serum, ruminal and intestinal contents from affected animals.
21851698:21	For toxin typing, a neutralisation test was performed by demonstrating mouse lethality on intraperitoneal injection of the specimen extracts with specific botulinum antitoxins A through E.
21851698:22	The mice were observed for clinical signs of botulism including respiratory distress, progressive paralysis or death over a period of four days . The neutralisation was considered successful if the animals with the homologous antiserum survived and if those with the heterologous antiserum died.
21851698:23	Initially, feed contaminated with poultry litter was removed from the meal.
21851698:24	The cattle were treated with the intravenous administration of 10 to 15 litres of lactated Ringers solution and 5% dextrose per day (Eczacibasi, Istanbul, Turkey), and oral administration of activated charcoal (Eucarbon; Santa Farma Inc., Istanbul, Turkey) at a rate of 1 g/kg PO.
21851698:25	After about 30 minutes, sodium sulphate (1 g/kg PO) was administered.
21851698:26	In addition, 0.005 mg/kg neostigmine (Neostigmin; Adeka Inc., Istanbul, Turkey)was administered subcutaneously.
21851698:27	In view of the risk of aspiration pneumonia, cefquinome (Cobactan, Intervet Inc., Istanbul, Turkey) was administered intramuscularly to each animal at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight, each day for five days.
21851698:28	Results 
In all the affected cattle, the appetite, ataxia, inability to rise, loss of tongue tone, decreased upper eyelid and tail tone, salivation, decreased ruminal movements were observed to varying degrees (Table ).
21851698:29	Eleven of the cattle, based on auscultation of the lungs.
21851698:30	In addition, cattle that were recumbent adopted a posture wherein the head was turned back against the flank, similar to that seen with hypocalcaemia (Figure ).
21851698:31	In the terminal stages of the disease, all the cattle were recumbent, had hypothermia and their respiration was laboured.
21851698:32	Haematological results were within normal limits, except for haematocrit, total white cell count and differentials in some animals.
21851698:33	Twelve of the cattle had leucocytosis (mean: 15.2 ± 0.9 × 10 9 cells/L, normal reference range: 4-12 × 10 9 cells/L ) along with neutrophilia (mean: 13.1 ± 0.9 × 10 9 cells/L, normal reference range 0.6-4 × 10 9 cells/L ).
21851698:34	In addition, 15 of the cattle had a high hematocrit (mean: 47.5 ± 2.1%, normal reference range: 24-46%).
21851698:35	There was a slight increase in the activities of AST (272.5 ± 21.3 U/L, normal reference range: 60-150 U/L) and CK (mean 315.9 ± 25.8 U/L, normal reference range: 46-169 U/L) in 14 of the recumbent animals.
21851698:36	In addition, the concentrations of serum urea (mean: 68.2 ± 6.9 mg/dL, normal reference range: 6-27 mg/dL), creatinine (mean: 3.4 ± 0.3 mg/dl, normal reference range: 1-2.7 mg/dL), total protein ( mean: 8.1 ± 0.4 g/dL, normal reference range: 6.6-7.8 g/dL) and potassium (mean: 6.4 ± 0.4 mEq/L, normal reference range: 3.9-5.8 mEq/L) were high in recumbent cows.
21851698:37	Other biochemical parameters were normal.
21851698:38	Serum samples, and feed materials such as grain, haylage and silage, were negative for botulinum toxin by mouse inoculation bioassay.
21851698:39	However, botulism was confirmed when mice were injected with specimen extracts including the ruminal, intestinal contents, and the ensiled poultry litter.
21851698:40	These mice developed the 'wasp-waist' sign, respiratory distress, progressive paralysis and death within 24 hours.
21851698:41	Only type C and type D antitoxins afforded protection, evidenced by survival of the mice.
21851698:42	Consequently, C. botulinum type C and D toxins were identified in all affected animals by mouse inoculation bioassay (Veterinary Control and Research Institute, Pendik, Istanbul) by using the filtered ruminal, intestinal contents and the feed material containing ensiled poultry litter.
21851698:43	In spite of therapy, there was no clinical improvement in the animals.
21851698:44	Progressive paralysis, with difficulty swallowing, occurred.
21851698:45	By day eight, a total of 26 cows had died.
21851698:46	No pathognomic changes were observed at necropsy, except for aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary oedema.
21851698:47	Discussion 
Botulism is a potentially lethal paralytic disease caused by Clostridium botulinum .
21851698:48	This bacterium grows best in neutral or alkaline conditions and produces toxins in anaerobic environments such as decaying vegetable matter and animal carcasses.
21851698:49	Where cattle subsist on a phosphorus-deficient diet, exhibit osteophagia and ingest carrion, the disease is likely to occur in outbreak form.
21851698:50	Types C and D are particularly well associated with carrion feed contaminated with dead rodents, cat, birds, or reptile, or any rotting material, and types C and D cases occur as outbreaks in cattle fed poultry litter [ , , ].
21851698:51	In this study, C botulium type C and D toxins were found in the ruminal, intestinal contents, serum and the ensiled poultry litter.
21851698:52	Ensiled poultry litter was considered as the likely source of the toxins.
21851698:53	The most distinctive symptoms of botulism type C or D intoxication are ataxia, progressive paralysis, dysphagia, salivation, bradycardia, loss of tongue tone, decrease in the muscle tone of the tail and rumen, dilated pupils presence of dry and hard faeces in the rectum and a characteristic recumbency [ , , ].
21851698:54	Loss of tongue tone is considered to be the most specific and sensitive clinical sign for botulism in cattle.
21851698:55	These signs are associated with the irreversible binding of botulism neurotoxins at the presynaptic site of the neuromuscular junction.
21851698:56	This binding inhibits the release of acetylcholine, resulting in flaccid paralysis.
21851698:57	Cattle affected from botulism in this report had similar clinical signs including hyporeflexia, decreased tongue tone, decreased pupillary and anal reflexes, ataxia, recumbency, salivation, constipation and difficulty swallowing (Table ).
21851698:58	In this clinical study, tentative diagnosis of botulism was based on the animals' history, and clinical findings.
21851698:59	Other diseases that have similar clinical signs, such as listeriosis, paralytic rabies, tick paralysis, hypocalcaemia, poisoning by organophosphates or carbamates, were considered in the differential diagnosis . To definitively diagnose a suspected outbreak of C. botulinum intoxication, however, the neurotoxin must be detected in serum, ruminal fluid, or the tissue of affected animals.
21851698:60	The mouse inoculation test is still the most reliable method for diagnosing botulism . Therefore, a definitive diagnosis was confirmed via the mouse toxicity test, by the identification of type C and type D toxins from ensiled poultry litter and ruminal and intestinal contents of affected cattle.
21851698:61	Enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) are also available for identifying neurotoxins but are currently less sensitive than the mouse inoculation test.
21851698:62	An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used for types C and D toxin  and for antibodies to types C and D toxins . 
None of haematology results were indicative of botulism [ , ].
21851698:63	Serum urea and creatinine concentrations, indicators of glomerular filtration, were moderately high in cattle with botulism in this case, probably due to loss of normal ability to urinate, atonic bladders  and dehydration as a result of reduction in water intake .
21851698:64	Similarly, a high haemotocrit and total protein levels may have resulted from dehydration.
21851698:65	Slight increases in the activities of AST and CK, which source from muscle, may be associated with recumbency.
21851698:66	Twelve of the cattle in this study had leucocytosis along with neutrophilia.
21851698:67	These changes probably resulted from complications such as aspiration pneumonia associated with respiratory paralysis and stress.
21851698:68	Recovery from botulism types C and D is extremely rare.
21851698:69	Therapy is mainly palliative and should include fluid and nutritional support, along with general nursing care.
21851698:70	Antibiotics should not be routinely administered in animals with botulism unless a secondary infection such as aspiration pneumonia is suspected.
21851698:71	Antibiotics that have been associated with neuromuscular weakness, including aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and penicillin, should be avoided . In addition to supportive care, the cattle in this study received activated charcoal, sodium sulphate and neostigmine.
21851698:72	By day eight of treatment, a total of 26 cows had died.
21851698:73	Death usually occurs between one and four days after the onset of clinical symptoms, but can take up to 14 days.
21851698:74	The prognosis in cattle with botulism is poor .
21851698:75	Although polyvalent antitoxin is useful in the early stages of botulism , it was not administered to the affected cattle in this study, because Clostridium botulinum type C and D antitoxins are not produced in Turkey and were unavailable.
21851698:76	Clinical reports describing outbreaks of type C and type D botulism in cattle, sheep and goats have come from many countries: the Netherlands , South Africa , Canada , Germany , Ireland , Brazil , the US  and Switzerland . C. botulinum type C and type D, however, has not been reported previously in cattle in Turkey.
21851698:77	Therefore, this study, which represents the first confirmation by direct detection of C. botulinum type C and type D toxins in cattle in Turkey, is important.

15967824:0	RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are essential for determining cellular survival/death after an apoptotic insult through the intrinsic pathway.
15967824:1	Loss of Bax or Bak alone, two proapoptotic multi-BH-domain proteins, has relatively little effect on mouse development, with the exception of the male infertility found in Bax −/− mice.
15967824:2	Loss of BH3-only genes results in increased cell accumulation and resistance to apoptosis, which often is cell type– or stimulus-specific.
15967824:3	For example, Bim is required for cytokine withdrawal and calcium flux–induced apoptosis, whereas Puma is essential for DNA damage–induced apoptosis transduced via the tumor suppressor p53.
15967824:4	The combined loss of Bak and Bax has dramatic consequences for mouse development and apoptosis signaling through the intrinsic pathway.
15967824:5	Although these data demonstrate the impact of deleting two multi-BH domain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, the consequences of removing a proapoptotic multi-BH domain family member plus a BH3-only gene have not been studied in vivo.
15967824:6	To date, the only related study examined the in vitro effect of deleting Bax and the BH3-only protein, Noxa.
15967824:7	Combined loss of Bax and Noxa conferred upon cultured fibroblasts increased protection against DNA damage–induced apoptosis as compared with loss of either protein alone.
15967824:8	However, there was no synergistic effect in Bax/Noxa DKO thymocytes that were UV irradiated.
15967824:9	These data suggest that Bax and Noxa interact with each other in a cell type–specific manner.
15967824:10	Here we demonstrate that Bax/Bim DKO mice display webbed paws, indicative of a developmental defect in apoptosis.
15967824:11	A similar defect was observed in Bak/Bax DKO mice, although the role of Bim in the developing footpad of these mice was not examined.
15967824:12	However, Bak/Bim DKO mice were born with normal digits.
15967824:13	These data indicate that Bax and either Bak or Bim are required for proper formation of the interdigital tissue.
15967824:14	Moreover, these data suggest that in the absence of Bax and Bim, Bak and the remaining BH3-only proteins are not sufficient for the induction of programmed cell death in the developing footpad.
15967824:15	However, in Bak/Bim DKO mice, Bax must be activated by a BH3-only protein, and this activation does not require the formation of higher-order complexes of Bax and Bak.
15967824:16	Taken together, these data suggest that Bak and Bim may act at the same level in the developing footpad.
15967824:17	Because BH3-only proteins function upstream of Bak/Bax in apoptosis signaling ( , ), this result indicates that Bim is the predominant activator upstream of Bak in programmed cell death of interdigitating cells.
15967824:18	Bax/Bim DKO mice with increased contribution of 129Sv background genes displayed a more severe phenotype, including growth retardation, malocclusions of the incisors, and premature death.
15967824:19	Dramatic influence of genetic background on the phenotype of mice lacking apoptosis-regulatory genes was observed previously.
15967824:20	For example, caspase-3–deficient mice are embryonic lethal on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129Sv background, but survive on an inbred C57BL/6 background.
15967824:21	Thus, one has to be cautious when interpreting small differences between KO and control mice that are kept on a mixed genetic background.
15967824:22	Our work demonstrates clearly that Bax/Bim DKO mice display a novel phenotype compared with Bax −/−, Bim −/−, or Bak/Bax DKO mice; this indicates an overlapping function for Bax and Bim in the development of teeth.
15967824:23	Few studies have examined the role of the Bcl-2 protein family in the development of myeloid cells.
15967824:24	A recent study demonstrated that cultured granulocytes lacking Bim or overexpressing prosurvival Bcl-2 are resistant to cytokine withdrawal in culture.
15967824:25	Our data suggest that the proapoptotic genes Bak and Bax are differentially required for myeloid progenitor cell survival/differentiation in the bone marrow of Bim −/− mice.
15967824:26	Even though Bim is a proapoptotic gene, Bim −/− mice have normal myeloid progenitor potential (unpublished data), but they have an unexpected reduction in total numbers of CD11b +Gr-1 − and CD11b +Gr-1 + bone marrow cells.
15967824:27	Bax, but not Bak, deficiency in Bim −/− mice is able to restore normal numbers of CD11b +Gr-1 − bone marrow cells through an unknown mechanism.
15967824:28	In contrast, deficiency in Bak and Bim mice completely restored the CD11b +Gr-1 + population in Bim −/− mice to the levels found in WT mice.
15967824:29	These data suggest that the functional redundancy displayed by Bak and Bax is cell type–specific.
15967824:30	Moreover, loss of Bim negatively affects developing myeloid cells, but the combined loss of Bax and Bim paradoxically suppresses myeloid progenitor potential (unpublished data).
15967824:31	Thus, in bone marrow, Bax, Bak, or Bim may function to promote the survival or differentiation of myeloid cells.
15967824:32	Together, these data indicate that expression of Bax or Bak differentially influences various myeloid cell fates in bone marrow of Bim −/− mice.
15967824:33	In contrast to bone marrow, Bak/Bim DKO and Bax/Bim DKO mice display a marked increase in circulating monocytes and neutrophils as compared with WT, Bak −/−, and Bax −/− mice.
15967824:34	Additionally, the myeloid populations in Bak/Bim DKO and Bax/Bim DKO mice resemble Bim −/− mice in peripheral blood.
15967824:35	Although there is a decrease in the numbers of F4/80 + peritoneal cells in Bim −/− mice as compared with WT, Bax −/−, and Bax/Bim DKO mice, there is a concomitant increase in lymphocytes in the peritoneum of Bim −/− and Bax/Bim DKO mice (unpublished data).
15967824:36	These data suggest that deficiency in Bim affects the ratio of macrophages/lymphocytes, at least in certain tissues.
15967824:37	Similarly, in liver and spleen, Bak/Bim DKO and Bax/Bim DKO mice have normal numbers of tissue macrophages.
15967824:38	These data suggest that Bak, Bax, or Bim do not affect extravasation or recruitment of monocytes into a subset of tissues.
15967824:39	Thus, an increase in the monocyte pool through a decrease in apoptosis is not a prerequisite for abnormally elevated numbers of macrophages in tissues.
15967824:40	Because in Bak/Bax DKO and Bax/Bim DKO mice there is a normal complement or reduction in myeloid precursor cells, respectively, and because there is no difference in the numbers of tissue or peritoneal macrophages, these data suggest that the increase in peripheral blood monocytes in Bak/Bim DKO, Bax/Bim DKO, or Bim −/− mice may be due to enhanced lifespan in peripheral blood.
15967824:41	The abnormal increase in the number of monocytes in peripheral blood of Bak/Bim DKO, Bax/Bim DKO, or Bim −/− mice may result in a negative feedback loop that reduces the number of myeloid cells in bone marrow.
15967824:42	Previous studies demonstrated that Bim, but not Bax, single-gene KO mice have abnormally increased numbers of B lymphocytes in spleen.
15967824:43	In Bax/Bim DKO mice, the increased numbers of CD19 + cells in bone marrow may be due to enhanced B cell production in bone marrow or increased survival of B cells within the marrow.
15967824:44	Alternatively, it is possible that increased numbers of B cells in peripheral blood may recirculate into bone marrow.
15967824:45	We did not observe an increase in the B cell population in bone marrow of Bak/Bim DKO or Bim −/− mice.
15967824:46	In contrast, combined deficiency in Bak/Bim or Bax/Bim exert a greater effect on the number of B cells compared with WT, Bax −/−, Bak −/−, and Bim −/− mice in peripheral blood.
15967824:47	However, the B cell population in Bak/Bim DKO and Bax/Bim DKO mice resemble Bim −/− mice.
15967824:48	Collectively, these data suggest that the overlapping role of Bak and Bax may be dependent on individual cell types within a given tissue.
15967824:49	Although not examined in this study, because Bim is critical for deletion of autoreactive B cells and because mice lacking Bim develop systemic lupus erythematosus–like disease (at least on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129Sv genetic background; reference ), it is possible that Bak/Bim DKO or Bax/Bim DKO mice may develop autoimmune disease, even on an inbred C57BL/6 background.
15967824:50	Taken together, the increase in B cells observed in Bak/Bim and Bax/Bim DKO mice is further evidence that Bim is central for the maintenance of B cell homeostasis.
15967824:51	Although Bim may activate Bak or Bax to regulate the development of B cells and to maintain their homeostasis in the periphery, Bim seems to act preferentially on Bax, but not on Bak, in thymocytes.
15967824:52	Defects in development of thymocytes in Bim −/− mice are not exacerbated by loss of Bax.
15967824:53	Bim −/− mice and Bax/Bim DKO mice display fewer double-positive thymocytes than WT animals.
15967824:54	This decrease in double-positive thymocytes may be attributed to enhanced maturation of thymocytes, which leave the thymus at a faster rate or it may be due to a negative feedback loop in the thymus triggered by the abnormally increased numbers of T cells in the periphery.
15967824:55	Conversely, mice lacking Bak and Bim show a thymic profile comparable to WT mice.
15967824:56	Together, these data suggest that although the expression of Bak and Bax overlap in the thymus, their functions are not redundant in Bim −/− mice.
15967824:57	In the thymus, Bak may not be activated by another BH3 protein or Bak is not sufficient to proceed with the process of negative selection in the absence of Bax and Bim.
15967824:58	In contrast, to compensate for the loss of Bak, mice lacking Bak and Bim may show increased activation of Bax, which may be responsible for the normal thymic populations.
15967824:59	In this situation, monomers of Bax or the increased levels of unbound Bcl-2–like prosurvival proteins may function to reduce the accelerated maturation observed in Bim −/− mice.
15967824:60	However, the latter possibility seems to be unlikely because overexpression of Bcl-2 in thymocytes induces a phenotype that resembles that found in Bim −/− mice.
15967824:61	It is still unclear why in the absence of Bim, Bax and Bak seem to be inactivated, whereas in mice deficient for Bak and Bim, Bax may be activated.
15967824:62	One possibility may be that in the thymus, Bak may function as a prosurvival protein, which previously was shown to occur in neurons.
15967824:63	Future studies are required to delineate the role of Bak and Bax in the selection and maturation processes of thymocytes in the absence of Bim.
15967824:64	The combined loss of Bak and Bax confers remarkable resistance to apoptosis induced by intrinsic apoptotic stimuli.
15967824:65	This inhibition is sustained over time because thymocytes or lymphocytes from Bak/Bax DKO mice do not undergo cytokine withdrawal-induced death over a 4-d period.
15967824:66	During apoptosis, Bax or Bak become activated by BH3 proteins; this has been postulated to occur through a direct interaction between these two groups of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members or through BH3 protein–mediated sequestering of prosurvival Bcl-2–like proteins.
15967824:67	The activated Bax or Bak causes permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (directly or indirectly), where it oligomerizes into higher-order species; this results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
15967824:68	Recent studies using KO mice provided insight into the functional interactions between BH3-only proteins, multi-BH domain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and antiapoptotic Bcl-2–like proteins.
15967824:69	Unlike deficiency in Bax or in the BH3-only gene, Bik, deficiency in Bim is able to rescue the defects observed in mice lacking Bcl-2.
15967824:70	These data suggest that Bcl-2 does not function solely to prevent the activation of Bax (but also must inactivate Bak function).
15967824:71	These data also suggest that one of the roles of Bim may be to block the function of Bcl-2.
15967824:72	Bcl-2/Bim DKO lymphocytes treated with certain intrinsic apoptotic stimuli (e.g., cytokine deprivation) undergo much less apoptosis than Bcl-2 −/− cells.; the Bcl-2/Bim DKO lymphocytes are as resistant to apoptotic stimuli as Bim −/− lymphocytes.
15967824:73	However, because Bcl-2/Bim DKO and Bim −/− cells still undergo apoptosis in response to certain apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA damage, these data indicate that factors in addition to Bim and Bcl-2 can regulate lymphocyte death.
15967824:74	In this scenario, other BH3-only proteins, such as Puma or Noxa, may activate Bak or Bax or inhibit Bcl-2–like prosurvival proteins, such as Bcl-x L or Mcl-1.
15967824:75	Because deficiency in Noxa alone or Noxa plus Bax failed to protect thymocytes against Xray irradiation, these data indicate that Noxa may not cooperate with Bax in this cell death pathway.
15967824:76	Here we show that Bim acts through Bak or Bax to induce thymocyte apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation or treatment with etoposide.
15967824:77	We show that thymocytes lacking Bak and Bim or Bax and Bim display a marked reduction in apoptosis, although not a complete inhibition as observed in thymocytes lacking Bak and Bax.
15967824:78	These data demonstrate that in cultured thymocytes, Bak and Bax act redundantly in the apoptotic process.
15967824:79	Our data does not preclude the possibility that the lack of Bak and Bim or Bax and Bim results in an increased level of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins, but we have not found any evidence for this.
15967824:80	Recent studies have shown that the BH3 peptide from Bim or Puma bind with very high affinity to all antiapoptotic Bcl-2–like proteins, whereas the BH3 domain regions from the other BH3-only proteins exhibited more selective binding.
15967824:81	This may indicate that Bim and Puma activate Bak/Bax function indirectly through binding and neutralization of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members.
15967824:82	Another recent study supports the possibility that Bim may act directly on Bak/Bax.
15967824:83	Bim BH3 peptide, but not the Puma BH3 peptide, was sufficient to induce the conformational change, oligomerization, and activation of Bak and Bax to permeabilize mitochondrial membranes.
15967824:84	Thus, future genetic studies (e.g., generation of mice lacking Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, or Bim) are necessary to determine whether Bim has an active role in apoptosis through activation of Bak or Bax or functions to sequester Bcl-2–like proteins.
17761080:0	INTRODUCTION 
Gaining safe access to the body cavity is a critical first step for a successful laparoscopic surgery.
17761080:1	Traditional trocar tip designs use retractable sharp bladed tips (pyramidal or single blade) to penetrate the body wall by cutting through the fascia and muscle layers.
17761080:2	More recently, conical trocar tip design for tissue dilation (radially or axially) to achieve access has been introduced.
17761080:3	In the gynecological and general surgical literature, the radially dilating trocar has been shown to be associated with less wound pain than that produced by the bladed trocar.
17761080:4	The dilating trocars have been shown in animal studies to create a smaller abdominal wall wound compared with the bladed trocar wounds.
17761080:5	Also, some authors have reported that it is not necessary to close the fascial wound created by a dilated trocar.
17761080:6	The trocar tip design and fascial wound closure may be some of the factors associated with trocar-site pain and the risk of complications including the development of a trocar-site hernia.
17761080:7	We performed a prospective study in patients undergoing urologic laparoscopy, specifically transperitoneal laparoscopic renal surgery, to compare 4 currently available disposable trocars with different tip varieties for postoperative pain and complications in a randomized double-blind (ie, patient and postoperative evaluator) setting.
17761080:8	METHODS 
Our medical school Human Studies Committee approved the study protocol.
17761080:9	Patients' ≥18 years old undergoing laparoscopic transperitoneal renal procedures were invited to participate in the study.
17761080:10	Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized and blinded to receive one of the 4 types of 12-mm study trocars.
17761080:11	All the trocars were inserted after pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle.
17761080:12	The procedures performed included radical or total nephrectomy, 36 nephron-sparing surgery, pyeloplasty, and renal cyst decortication.
17761080:13	A standardized lateral 5-mm, noncutting, metal trocar (Storz EndoTIP, Storz Inc., Tuttlingen, Germany) was placed in each case and used as a standard reference point to normalize the patients' pain scores with other trocar sites.
17761080:14	Evaluation of pain is challenging due to its intrinsically subjective nature and pain threshold variation from person to person.
17761080:15	Additionally, there could be variation of pain at different anatomic sites.
17761080:16	As such, the study was designed to assess trocar-site pain for only the flank approach with a standardized “diamond” configuration for the placement of trocars.
17761080:17	Normalization of pain scores was performed by calculating the mean pain score for the lumbar trocar site and normalizing it to the 5-mm lateral port pain score for each individual patient according to his pain assessment score along the visual analog pain scale (VAS).
17761080:18	The pain scores at the other trocar sites were correspondingly normalized to the 5-mm lateral port site, to eliminate the individual differences in the pain threshold among the participants.
17761080:19	Based on the pain scores from previously published research protocols, we expect pain scores (VAS) with radially dilating trocars, single-bladed trocars, and pyramidalbladed trocars to be 3.5, 6.2, and 6.2, respectively.
17761080:20	With an SD of 2.5 and to achieve a power of 81%, the study required 14 patients in each arm to detect differences with a significance of P=0.05.
17761080:21	As such, 56 patients were incorporated into the study.
17761080:22	The pain score analysis was carried out with the paired t test using ANOVA data analysis for variable parameters.
17761080:23	RESULTS 
A total of 221 trocar insertions were performed in 56 patients.
17761080:24	Additionally, 12 hand-assist devices were deployed during some of the procedures.
17761080:25	There were 165 trocar sites for evaluation in the study including 43 PB, 41 SB, 38 AD, and 43 RD trocar sites.
17761080:26	The mean patient body mass index was 31.3 (range, 20 to 62) and was similar among all 4 trocar study groups.
17761080:27	The mean patient age was 58 years (range, 19 to 90) and included 30 males and 26 females.
17761080:28	The mean operative time was 263 minutes (range, 75 to 525) with an average estimated blood loss of 234mL (range, 10 to 3500).
17761080:29	The lower abdominal quadrant was used for primary port insertion in 37 (66%) cases.
17761080:30	The mean pain scores at 3 hours, 24 hours, and 1-week postoperatively were not statistically significant among different trocar varieties at 24-hour evaluation.
17761080:31	The mean pain scores at 12-mm “pure” trocar sites not used for morcellation or specimen extraction were statistically significantly lower than the pain scores at morcellation, hand-assist device, or specimen extraction sites (P<0.05, adjusting for multiple comparisons) at 3-hour, 24-hour, and 1-week postoperative evaluations.
17761080:32	Also, the morcellation sites had significantly lower mean pain scores than did the hand-assist device sites (P<0.05, after adjusting for multiple comparisons), at 3-, 24-hour, and 1-week postoperative evaluations.
17761080:33	Also at 1- and 3-month postoperative evaluations, no statistically significant differences were noted in the mean pain scores between “pure” trocar, morcellation, and hand-assist device sites.
17761080:34	Closure of the fascial layer was not routinely performed with the RD or AD trocars on 82% of occasions.
17761080:35	The fascial layer of the dilating trocar sites was closed on 6 occasions (7%) for frequent trocar slippage, and all the bladed trocar sites were closed.
17761080:36	There was no statistically significant difference in the mean pain scores between the fascially closed 90 and unclosed sites 75 at 3-hour (VAS 3.8 and 3.4, P=0.13), 24-hour (VAS 4.1 and 3.9, P=0.9) and 1-week (VAS 2.9 and 2.8, P=0.7) postoperative time points, respectively.
17761080:37	Anatomically, in our series, the umbilical and upper and lower quadrant trocar sites caused a similar degree of pain; however, the 5-mm lateral trocar site caused significantly less pain (P<0.05) than did the other sites.
17761080:38	No injuries occurred to intraabdominal vessels or bowel caused by any of the trocar types.
17761080:39	A superficial liver injury occurred due to a Veress needle insertion with the sleeve of an RD trocar during primary access.
17761080:40	The bleeding was controlled by compression with Gelfoam on the bleeding site for a few minutes.
17761080:41	The postoperative bleeding or bruising at the port site by different study trocars was not significantly different.
17761080:42	Eight (4.8%) minor complications occurred: bleeding from the trocar site in 7 (4.2%) and wound infection in 1 (0.6%).
17761080:43	Bleeding resulted from primary trocar access in only a single case; the remaining bleeding episodes occurred from secondary access sites.
17761080:44	Four bleeding episodes resulted from PB trocars, and the remaining 3 resulted from one of each of the other 3 trocar varieties.
17761080:45	No epigastric vessel injury occurred.
17761080:46	Bleeding was controlled by full-thickness abdominal wall suturing using a Carter-Thomason device in one case caused by a PB trocar.
17761080:47	In 2 cases, fascial suturing using a Carter-Thomason device was used to control bleeding caused by a PB trocar.
17761080:48	A single bleeding episode each caused by PB, SB, RD, and AD trocars at the peritoneal surface was controlled by bipolar electrocautery.
17761080:49	A solitary wound infection occurred at the umbilical PB trocar site in a patient who had previous splenectomy.
17761080:50	Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the wound, which was treated with cephalexin.
17761080:51	Thirty (14 AD and 16 RD) dilating trocars were inserted at the 12-mm midline umbilical site.
17761080:52	Fascial closure was not performed at 21 umbilical sites created by the dilating trocars (10 AD and 11 RD sites).
17761080:53	Gas leakage events and trocar “slippage” occurred more often with the RD trocar compared with the other 3 trocars combined (12 and 10, respectively) (P<0.05).
17761080:54	Device malfunction episodes with the RD trocar were more frequent than with the other trocars combined (P<0.05).
17761080:55	This was mainly due to the problems with the handling of the reducer mechanism, and dislodgment of the trocar during removal of the EndoGIA stapler.
17761080:56	However, device malfunction did not directly contribute to any of the trocar-related complications.
17761080:57	There were no trocar-site hernias during a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range, 14 to 36).
17761080:58	DISCUSSION 
Previous studies have suggested that RD trocar sites are less painful compared with bladed trocar insertion sites.
17761080:59	,, However, in our randomized study, no statistically significant difference occurred in the trocar-site pain between different 12-mm trocars, whether the trocar tip was bladed or the dilating type (P>0.05).
17761080:60	In this regard, it is of note that our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to directly compare axial, radial, and cutting trocars in a prospective manner.
17761080:61	Interestingly, and possibly further validating our findings, is the observation that pain at the morcellation, specimen extraction, and hand-port sites was statistically significantly higher than pain at the 12-mm pure trocar sites not used for morcellation or specimen extraction.
17761080:62	Also, of note, the morcellation sites were less painful than the hand-assist device sites in the early postoperative period (P<0.05).
17761080:63	The fascial layer of the dilating trocar sites was closed on 6 occasions (7%) for frequent trocar slippage.
17761080:64	Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis, fascial closure compared with unclosed sites was not associated with increased discomfort.
17761080:65	Pain is a subjective complex symptom, and no significant difference in pain between different types of trocars in our study contrary to findings in other studies could be partly due to the nature of the procedure and location of trocar sites.
17761080:66	Renal laparoscopy is a complex procedure that on many occasions requires an incision or insertion of a hand-assist device to extract the specimen.
17761080:67	The incision pain from specimen extraction site, morcellation, or hand-assist device site may “alter” or “mask” the pain at the trocar sites.
17761080:68	Also, postoperative abdominal discomfort or distension may alter the trocar-site pain.
17761080:69	Nevertheless, in our randomized study, only patients undergoing renal laparoscopy were selected, and trocar site configuration was standardized.
17761080:70	Also, the individual trocar-site pain was “normalized” to a standard lateral 5-mm nondisposable trocar site.
17761080:71	Studies have shown trocar-related access injuries can account for up to half of the reported laparoscopic complications.
17761080:72	– Turner reviewed the results on the safety of RD trocars (the Step system) from 11 studies.
17761080:73	There were 15 000 RD trocar insertions with no major vascular injuries and no deaths reported.
17761080:74	In our randomized study, all 4 disposable trocar types were found to be safe with no major complications.
17761080:75	Eight minor complications occurred, which included 7 bleeding sites from the abdominal wall that were easily controlled by standard surgical techniques with no significant blood loss.
17761080:76	Sharp and coworkers searched MEDLINE and FDA Medical Device Reporting databases for reports of complications associated with optical access trocars not reported in the medical literature.
17761080:77	Seventy-nine serious injuries were cited during general surgical and gynecological procedures; 26 were due to Optiview nonbladed and 53 to Visiport bladed trocars.
17761080:78	With the nonbladed trocar, 6 major vessel injuries and 12 bowel perforations occurred with one associated mortality.
17761080:79	With the bladed system, 31 major vessel injuries and 6 bowel injuries occurred, with 3 associated deaths.
17761080:80	Thomas and coauthors reported on their use of optical access trocars with a recessed blade at its distal tip in 1283 urologic procedures.
17761080:81	They reported 4 (0.31%) injuries including 1 small-bowel injury, 1 mesenteric injury, and 2 epigastric vessel injuries.
17761080:82	Nonetheless, in our opinion, the AD trocar access (ie, Optiview, Ethicon Inc.) is superior due to several features.
17761080:83	First, it is safe and its shaft is constructed such that it securely remains in position once placed across the abdominal wall.
17761080:84	Second, fascial closure is not required thereby reducing the operative time and cost.
17761080:85	Lastly, the Optiview transparent trocar sheath allows the withdrawal of the trocar through the abdominal wall without completely dislodging the trocar.
17761080:86	Studies have also reported that the application of optical trocar systems can reduce the complications related to primary trocar insertion.
17761080:87	,
The incidence of abdominal wall hernias with metal bladed trocars, despite fascial closure, is approximately 1% (range, 0.02% to 5%).
17761080:88	,, Bhoyrul and coworkers demonstrated in a porcine model that the defect in the abdominal wall caused by the RD system was 52% smaller in width than the defect caused by the cutting trocar.
17761080:89	In keeping with the laboratory findings, clinical studies with RD trocars have shown no hernias, despite no fascial closure of these sites.
17761080:90	However, more recently Nakada and coworkers reported a case of hernia through a nonmidline site created by a nonbladed 12-mm trocar where fascial closure was not performed.
17761080:91	Shalhav and coworkers assessed the safety of fascial nonclosure at the nonmidline 12-mm AD trocar sites in patients undergoing renal surgery.
17761080:92	With a mean follow-up of 4.8 months, there were no hernias in all 20 patients with fascial nonclosure compared with 20 matched patients who had fascial closure.
17761080:93	However, these studies, as with ours, may underestimate the incidence of trocar-site hernias because the evaluations were frequently performed by telephone interview.
17761080:94	Of note, even though the midline trocar-site fascial layer (without muscle cover) was not routinely closed, no symptomatic hernia has occurred among 30 dilating trocars placed in this location in our study.
17761080:95	CONCLUSION 
All 4 disposable trocar varieties were safe and yielded similar postoperative pain scores with or without the trocar-site fascial wound closure.
17761080:96	Dilating access devices do not need fascial closure, and thereby can save operative time.
17761080:97	Device malfunction due to reducer mechanism problems and trocar dislodgment was more often seen with RD trocars.
17761080:98	The 12-mm trocar sites resulted in statistically significant less postoperative pain than the hand-assist device or morcellation wound sites in the early postoperative period.
17761080:99	With a minimum follow-up of 1.5 years, no symptomatic hernias have been related to these trocars.
17761080:100	Based on these findings, the AD trocars have become our trocar of choice.
21596782:0	INTRODUCTION 
Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs), and it functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the diverse biological effects of estrogens, including development, maintenance of female reproductive functions and the etiology of breast cancer.
21596782:1	NRs consist of a variable N-terminal region, a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a conserved ligand binding domain (LBD).
21596782:2	ERα and other NRs bind to hormone response elements in their target promoters and regulate the expression of a variety of target genes through the recruitment of co-regulators (co-activators and co-repressors) that mediate local chromatin remodeling as well as communications with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated basal transcription machinery.
21596782:3	The p160 co-activators (e.g. SRC-1, GRIP1 and AIB1) interact directly with hormone-activated NRs and serve as protein scaffolds for the assembly of multicomponent co-activator complexes on target promoters.
21596782:4	p160 co-activators recruit secondary co-activators, including histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP, histone methyltransferase CARM1 and CoCoA, and act synergistically with secondary co-activators to enhance NR function.
21596782:5	Mediator, another multisubunit co-activator complex, is believed to act as a molecular bridge between NRs and Pol II-associated basal transcription machinery.
21596782:6	Recently, we identified cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) as a CoCoA binding protein.
21596782:7	CCAR1 interacts with ERα and cooperates synergistically with components of the p160 co-activator complex.
21596782:8	CCAR1 is important for estrogen-induced expression of ERα target genes and estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells.
21596782:9	CCAR1 associates with components of the Mediator complex and facilitates recruitment of Mediator complex to the promoter of target genes by providing a physical link between p160 co-activator and Mediator complexes.
21596782:10	In addition, CCAR1 binds to and cooperates synergistically with β-catenin as a secondary co-activator for LEF1.
21596782:11	Thus, CCAR1 is a physiologically relevant part of several transcriptional activation processes.
21596782:12	In addition to co-regulators, post-translational modifications are also crucial for the regulation of NR function such as DNA binding, interaction with co-regulators, stability and subcellular localization.
21596782:13	For example, ERα is acetylated by p300 at several lysine residues in the hinge region, and the acetylation enhances DNA binding and trans -activation activities of ERα.
21596782:14	Although, a previous report suggested that the acetylation of ERα is reversed by cellular deacetylases, including Trichostatin A (TSA)-sensitive enzymes (classes I and II deacetylases) and nicotinamide-sensitive enzymes (class III deacetylases such as SIRT1), their roles in ERα-mediated transcription is still largely unknown.
21596782:15	To further characterize the mechanism by which CCAR1 contributes to transcriptional activation, we used a biochemical approach to identify CCAR1-associated proteins and found deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1; also known as KIAA1967 and p30 DBC) as a CCAR1-interacting protein.
21596782:16	DBC1 was originally cloned from a region 8p21 that was homozygously deleted in breast cancer.
21596782:17	Recently, DBC1 has been reported as a negative regulator of SIRT1.
21596782:18	DBC1 interacts with the catalytic domain of SIRT1, inhibits its deacetylase activity, and then increases acetylation levels of p53, thereby enhancing p53-mediated apoptosis.
21596782:19	However, despite the tumor suppressor function of DBC1, several studies reported increased expression of DBC1 in breast carcinoma, suggesting that DBC1 may participate in the development and progression of breast cancer.
21596782:20	In this study, we show that DBC1 associates and cooperates synergistically with CCAR1 to enhance ERα function.
21596782:21	DBC1 is required for the expression of a subset of ERα target genes and estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells.
21596782:22	SIRT1 deacetylates ERα, causing reduced DNA binding.
21596782:23	DBC1 inhibits SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and restores optimal recruitment of ERα to target gene promoters.
21596782:24	SIRT1 also represses the co-activator synergy between CCAR1 and DBC1 by competing with CCAR1 for binding to DBC1 and thereby disrupting the DBC1–CCAR1 interaction.
21596782:25	Collectively, our results suggest that DBC1 and SIRT1 play reciprocal roles in the regulation of ERα activity and co-activator synergy.

21494328:0	Introduction 
The relatively large and complex brain of vertebrates is one of the most
   characteristic features of this lineage, and is linked to many important features of
   vertebrate behaviour and ecology.
21494328:1	Sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities
   are central to the success of many taxa, and may have imposed powerful selection for
   increases in relative brain size – .
21494328:2	At the same time, however, brains are expensive: on a
   mass-specific basis, the metabolic cost of brain function is among the highest of
   any organ ,
    . We thus
   might expect the benefits of increased intellect to be balanced against metabolic
   costs, with relative brain size in any given species reflecting that tradeoff . How can we test
   hypotheses about the functional advantages of larger brain size?
21494328:3	One way is to argue
   from design, under the assumption that specific components of the brain have
   particular functions and that an increase in size of that component will enhance
   organismal performance in that function – .
21494328:4	This method is difficult to
   apply to overall brain size, however, because of complex correlated shifts in brain
   structure as well as size .
21494328:5	An alternative method, and the one we adopt in the
   present paper, is to look for correlations between relative brain size and some
   aspect of ecological functioning.
21494328:6	What kind of challenges should a larger brain help an organism to solve?
21494328:7	If cognition
   is important, a larger-brained individual should be more adept at dealing with novel
   challenges.
21494328:8	High rates of anthropogenic translocation of species around the world
    – provide an ideal
   opportunity to test this hypothesis; if a large brain helps to deal with novel
   challenges, then larger brains should be particularly useful for organisms that are
   suddenly confronted with a novel set of biotic and abiotic challenges as a result of
   translocation ,
    , . Translocated
   species face a range of novel challenges, such as unfamiliar predators, pathogens,
   and prey – . Some of those challenges place a premium on an
   organism's physiology (e.g., thermal tolerance, immune function), but others
   can be overcome only by organisms that can flexibly modify their behaviour in
   response to novel cues . In keeping with this hypothesis, species of birds and
   mammals with larger brain masses relative to body mass tend to have been more
   successful at establishing viable populations in novel environments . The selective
   advantage to larger brain size might simply involve more brain tissue (to transmit
   impulses to and from integrative centres, such as the cerebral cortex: ) or an
   increase in cognitive function (the brain size-environmental change (BS-EC) theory,
   that larger brains increase behavioural flexibility: ).
21494328:9	How general are these results?
21494328:10	Amphibians and reptiles have smaller forebrains than
   do birds and mammals, and are widely believed not to have the same level of
   behavioural complexity . Plausibly, then, advantages of larger relative brain
   size may be unique to birds and mammals.
21494328:11	Alternatively, a larger brain size might
   enhance colonizing ability in amphibians and reptiles in the same way as it does in
   endothermic vertebrates, despite the differences in brain structure between
   ectotherms and endotherms.
21494328:12	A selective advantage to larger brain size in
   translocated amphibians and reptiles might suggest that a relationship between brain
   size and the ability to cope with novel conditions reflects broader advantages of
   increased brain capacity, not just an increase in forebrain (cognitive) function.
21494328:13	To
   examine the generality of the purported relationship between larger brain size and
   capacity to thrive in a novel environment, we have analysed data on anthropogenic
   introductions of amphibians and reptiles to areas outside of their native geographic
   ranges.
21494328:14	If a larger brain facilitates dealing with new challenges, we predict that
   success in establishing viable populations following translocation will be higher in
   amphibians and reptiles with large brains relative to their body sizes.
21494328:15	Results 
Overall, patterns of establishment success in translocated amphibians and reptiles
   support the prediction that species with larger relative brain sizes will be more
   successful when confronted with environmental change.
21494328:16	Our analyses of anthropogenic
   introductions revealed that the probability of successful establishment in a novel
   environment increased with increasing residual brain mass in six out of seven
   biogeographic realms.
21494328:17	However, the intercept and slope of the relationship between
   residual brain mass and establishment probability varied according to biogeographic
   realm (likelihood ratio test between models with and without random slopes:
    D  = 8.0,
    P  = 0.018).
21494328:18	After accounting for taxonomic
   autocorrelations and propagule pressure, effects of residual brain mass on
   establishment success were positive in the Palearctic (per-realm intercept ±
   slope  =  −0.95+0.28), the Nearctic
   (−0.67+0.65), the Neotropics (1.1+3.0), Indomalaysia
   (0.73+2.6),
21494328:19	Oceania (−0.15+1.36), and the Afrotropics
   (1.3+3.3), but negative in Australasia (−2.2–1.4).
21494328:20	However,
   95% prediction intervals on these random intercepts and slopes overlapped
   zero in Oceania, Indomalaysia, and the Afrotropics (see ).
21494328:21	In
   the latter two realms, this result was likely due to low recorded numbers of
   unsuccessful introductions (n = 1 and
   n = 2, respectively).
21494328:22	Omission of these two realms did not
   influence our finding that establishment success increases with residual brain mass
   in all realms except Australasia (likelihood ratio test between models with and
   without random slopes: D  = 6.7,
21494328:23	P  = 0.035).
21494328:24	We also found no evidence to
   suggest that effects of propagule pressure varied by realm (likelihood ratio test
   between models with and without random slopes:
    D  = 3.6,
    P  = 0.17).
21494328:25	Similar results were obtained for the effects of residual brain mass on invasion
   success at the family level.
21494328:26	After accounting for order membership, invasion potential increased
   with increasing average residual brain mass per family (estimate ± se
    = 1.2±0.29 in log-log space;
    n  = 16,
    P  = 0.0022).
21494328:27	Discussion 
Among the species of amphibians and reptiles that have undergone human
   translocations, those with larger relative brain size have been more successful than
   smaller-brained species at establishing populations in novel environments.
21494328:28	This
   pattern is relatively consistent in our data, being seen at the familial level, as
   well as within six of seven biogeographic realms at the species level.
21494328:29	The same
   evolutionary trend is seen in birds and mammals , suggesting that larger brain size
   enhances the ability to deal with novel environmental challenges in all four major
   classes of terrestrial vertebrates.
21494328:30	Why is a larger relative brain size associated with higher colonization success
   following translocation?
21494328:31	Although the consistency of the correlation taxonomically
   and geographically suggests a causal connection, the nature of any functional
   benefits conferred by a larger brain remains unclear.
21494328:32	In our analyses, larger brains
   did not enhance establishment success of translocated ectotherms in all
   environments.
21494328:33	Translocated amphibians and reptiles with smaller (rather than larger)
   brains were more successful at establishing populations in Australasia.
21494328:34	Environmental factors may select against larger brain size if a lack of resources
   exacerbates the energetic costs of maintaining such an expensive organ.
21494328:35	Low resource
   availability in Australasia may favour phenotypic traits (such as small brain size)
   that reduce an animal's total energy requirements . Evolutionary trends towards
   reduced fecundity levels in rodents and in birds that have invaded Australia over
   longer (evolutionary) time periods accord with this hypothesis . What functional advantages to
   larger brain size in a novel environment might be strong enough to offset the cost
   of maintaining a larger brain?
21494328:36	Previous studies on endothermic vertebrates have attributed the relationship between
   brain size and establishment success to cognitive abilities, in turn linked to the
   elaboration of forebrain size and capacity in larger-brained mammals and birds . Amphibians and
   reptiles do not have brain structures directly analogous to the forebrain of birds
   and mammals, suggesting that an increase in relative brain size is unlikely to
   confer the same cognitive advantages as would a relatively large brain in a bird or
   a mammal ,
    . There may
   well be superior cognitive ability in larger-brained amphibians and reptiles, but
   increases in non-cognitive functions (involving sensory and motor functions, for
   example) also may have facilitated the survival of vertebrates in novel
   environments.
21494328:37	Our data do not enable us to discriminate between the alternative explanations for
   the correlation between brain size and invasion success.
21494328:38	Invaders may prosper in
   novel environments either because of enhanced cognitive skills (presumably related
   to forebrain size) or to a wider suite of information-processing abilities (related
   to several parts of the brain).
21494328:39	Even if the actual advantage was entirely driven by
   forebrain size, overall brain size may be highly correlated with absolute forebrain
   size; and much of the interspecific variation in cognitive ability thus may be
   driven by variation in overall brain size not in relative importance of the
   forebrain versus other components.
21494328:40	Larger brain size also may increase the level of
   neural connectivity between brain compartments, thus enhancing the coordination of
   multiple functions (as in visuomotor relays: ).
21494328:41	Thus, data on the ecological
   correlates of overall brain size cannot reveal which brain compartments are
   functionally significant to animals in novel environments.
21494328:42	To tease apart the functional basis for a relationship between brain size and
   survival in novel environments, we need to examine how variation in specific brain
   features (overall size vs. size of individual components vs. density of neural
   relays) maps onto ecological parameters such as invasion success.
21494328:43	For example, a
   larger medial cortex may confer better memory in reptiles, increasing spatial
   learning and the ability to locate critical resources in unfamiliar surroundings
    .
   Correlative studies of brain size need to include known morphological predictors of
   brain size as well as geographic and taxonomic variables to give a robust and clear
   view of brain function and evolution . 
To minimize confounding factors that are inevitable in any interspecific comparison,
   research on this topic might usefully focus on geographically wide-ranging species
   that extend across environments posing a range of challenges to
   information-processing.
21494328:44	An extensive literature on reptiles and amphibians, as well
   as other taxa, shows that a wide range of morphological, physiological, behavioural
   and ecological traits can vary considerably across a species' distribution
    – . Such variation hints that brain size and structure may
   vary also, providing an exciting opportunity for future work to tease apart the ways
   in which the characteristics of an animal's brain influences that
   organism's ability to cope with the challenges posed by both ancestral and
   novel environmental conditions.
21494328:45	Given widespread predictions of substantial changes
   in abiotic conditions over the range of most species within the next several decades
    an
   ability to cope with novel challenges may well prove to be one of the most
   significant predictors of species viability in the face of global change.
21494328:46	Materials and Methods 
We used data on the success or failure of amphibian and reptile introductions
   collated by Kraus . Introductions were considered successful if they
   resulted in the establishment of a viable population according to the most recent
   literature citation .
21494328:47	Following the method used by Sol et al .
    , we classified
   multiple introductions of a single species to an area as one introduction event.
21494328:48	Introduction locations consisted of countries, islands, archipelagos, states, or
   provinces .
   Data on brain and body mass ( n  = 149 species)
   were collected from various sources – . Nearly half
    ( n  = 72) of the species for which we
   obtained brain-mass data have been introduced outside of their native geographic
   ranges at least once, providing data on 561 introduction events for our analyses
   (Amphibia n  = 229, Reptilia
    n  = 332).
21494328:49	This ratio of species to
   introduction events (0.13) is similar to that used in a previous test of
   differential success due to relative brain size among mammals (0.15: ).
21494328:50	Larger species typically have larger brains (see ),
   potentially confounding the influences of body and brain mass on establishment
   success.
21494328:51	To remove this allometric effect, we calculated the residuals from a linear
   regression of taxonomic order and log-body mass on log-brain mass
    ( n  = 149 species,
    R 2 = 94%.
    P  =  <0.0001).
21494328:52	Some insular mammals
   have brain masses smaller than those predicted using mainland allometric data but there are
   no data to test for such effects in amphibians and reptiles.
21494328:53	Taxonomic order was
   included as a covariate to account for potential grade shifts between higher taxa
    , . 
We tested whether residual brain mass correlated with the probability of successful
   establishment using generalized linear mixed effects models (logit link, binomial
   error distribution).
21494328:54	In all models, the dependent variable was whether or not an
   introduction attempt had been successful.
21494328:55	Because previous research has shown that
   the total number of independent introduction attempts (propagule pressure) to a
   given area is a critical determinant of establishment probability , we included
   propagule pressure for each location in all models investigating the relationship
   between residual brain mass and establishment success (see and for details).
21494328:56	To account for
   taxonomic biases among introduction events, we included species, genus, family, and
   order as nested random effects.
21494328:57	We also included a random effect describing the
   biogeographic realm in which introductions occurred to control for clustering of
   introduction attempts within regions.
21494328:58	Residual brain mass and log-propagule pressure
   were entered into the model as fixed effects.
21494328:59	A minimum adequate model of
   establishment probability was derived by conducting likelihood ratio tests between
   nested models using a backward sequence of variable removal
   (α = 0.05).
21494328:60	P-values produced by this model selection
   approach are often conservative (i.e., higher than they should be: ).
21494328:61	In another set of analyses, we looked for patterns at the familial level rather than
   treating each species as a separate entity.
21494328:62	For each family represented in our
   introduction database, we first averaged residual brain mass of the species within
   that family relative to the overall allometric relationship between brain mass and
   body mass (based on all species for which we had brain-mass data).
21494328:63	We then looked
   for a relationship between this measure of familial-level average residual brain
   mass and the invasion potential of each family.
21494328:64	To estimate familial-level invasion
   potential, we extracted the family-level random effects coefficients of a
   generalized linear mixed effects model where the success or failure of each
   introduction attempt was the dependent variable, propagule pressure was a fixed
   effect, and species, genus, family, order, and biogeographic realm were random
   effects .
   Finally, after accounting for order membership, we investigated whether
   familial-level invasion potential was correlated with the mean residual brain mass
   of each family using a linear mixed effects model.
21494328:65	Only families that were
   represented by at least two species in both the introduction and brain-mass
   databases were included in this analysis
   ( n  = 16 families).
21494328:66	All statistical analyses
   were conducted in R © 2.9.0 using the lme4 library (Bates and
   Maechler 2009; R Development Core Team 2009).

20353611:0	Background 
Frailty is highly prevalent in older people.
20353611:1	Up to 40% of older people can be considered as frail and an increasing trend can be expected . Next to its high prevalence, frailty is characterized by its seriousness as it is related to an increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as disability [ - ].
20353611:2	Disability is defined as difficulty or dependency in the execution of activities of daily living and it is associated with increased health service utilization and related costs.
20353611:3	Frailty and disability are separate but overlapping concepts.
20353611:4	On the one hand, frailty predicts disability.
20353611:5	On the other hand, disability may well exacerbate frailty .
20353611:6	With regard to a growing frail population and limited health care expenditures, disability in community-dwelling frail older people is suggested to be a public health problem . Therefore disability prevention in community-dwelling frail older people is considered to be a priority for research and clinical practice in geriatric care . 
Several authors emphasize a two-step approach in preventive interventions for community-dwelling frail older people, in which screening is followed by extensive assessment.
20353611:7	With valid (screening) instruments to identify frail older people this approach may avoid costs and the unnecessary assessment of healthy people . During the last few decades, various instruments, based on various definitions, have been developed to detect frailty.
20353611:8	This has lead to a diversity of prevalence estimates of frailty . Little is yet known about the reliability and validity of these instruments and no gold standard exists.
20353611:9	Therefore, more insight into the psychometric properties of frailty instruments is relevant for geriatric care and research in this area . 
Frailty instruments have been developed from the point of view of different perspectives on frailty .
20353611:10	From a physiological perspective physical frailty markers, such as unintentional weight loss or weakness (grip strength), are used to identify frail older people . Next to physical factors, a multifactorial perspective on frailty also takes psychological, social and environmental factors into account .
20353611:11	An example of such an instrument is the Frailty Index , which combines, for example, physical frailty markers such as weight loss and grip strength with other factors such as cognition, mood or limitations in (instrumental) activities of daily living.
20353611:12	Frailty may be elaborated more sharply if it is described from a physiological perspective, however, the usefulness of this perspective in daily practice is questioned, as frailty cannot be separated from other factors such as cognition, mood or social support . 
Frailty instruments can be divided into self-report and performance-based instruments .
20353611:13	It is assumed that performance-based instruments provide more precise and valid answers .
20353611:14	Although they are less influenced by socio-demographic variables, personality and cognitive and affective factors, they are more sensitive to non-response, changes in time and differences in the execution of activities.
20353611:15	Furthermore, they are less easy to conduct and time-consuming [ - ].
20353611:16	Self-report measures are believed to be an efficient method for reaching large groups and for providing high response rates and reliable and valid answers . 
In this study, we present the psychometric properties of frailty instruments that define frailty from a multifactorial perspective and are applicable for postal screening of community-dwelling older people.
20353611:17	Given this objective and the target population, the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) , the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI)  and the Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire (SPQ)  were chosen.
20353611:18	The GFI and the SPQ have been used in previous studies for the purpose of postal screening [ - ], however, empirical evidence about the psychometric properties of the GFI, the TFI, and the SPQ is still scarce.
20353611:19	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare their psychometric properties.

Results 
Discussion 
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the psychometric properties of three screening instruments that define frailty from a multifactorial perspective and which are applicable for postal screening in community-dwelling frail older people.
20353611:21	The chosen instruments were the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) and the Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire (SPQ).
20353611:22	From the present study we may conclude that: (1) prevalence estimates of frailty ranged between 40.2% (TFI), 46.3% (GFI) and 59.1% (SPQ); (2) the agreement in identifying frailty between the GFI and the TFI was satisfactory (kappa = 0.74) and the agreements between the SPQ and the GFI and the TFI, respectively, were much lower; (3) both the GFI and the TFI had high internal consistency in contrast to the SPQ; (4) the GFI and the TFI had better construct validity in comparison with the SPQ.
20353611:23	Prevalence estimates of 40% to 60% found in the present study can be considered as high.
20353611:24	It is important to bear in mind that prevalence estimates strongly depend on the interpretation of the concept of frailty and the approach that is chosen to measure it . In a recent study by Santos-Eggimann and colleagues , a distinction was made between frail and pre-frail older people based on the frailty phenotype of Fried and colleagues . In a Dutch sample of community-dwelling older people, Santos-Eggimann and colleagues  found a frailty prevalence of 11.3%, while 38.5% were identified as pre-frail.
20353611:25	These results indicate that the instruments in our study, based on the proposed cut-off points, may identify pre-frail instead of frail older people.
20353611:26	Further research is needed to provide a better view on relevant cut-off points for frailty instruments.
20353611:27	Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the predictive power of instruments to identify older people who are at risk for adverse health outcomes in the near future.
20353611:28	Steverink and colleagues  suggested that the GFI is an internally consistent scale with positive indications for construct and clinical validity.
20353611:29	The present study supports these findings.
20353611:30	Similar results for the TFI may be explained by seven out of fifteen items of the TFI being identical with the GFI.
20353611:31	These items are about hearing and vision capacity, unintentional weight loss and psychosocial and cognitive functioning.
20353611:32	Please see Additional file : Frailty Instruments: Overview of all items for more information about the instruments.
20353611:33	Scores on the Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire were higher for males compared with females.
20353611:34	This finding is inconsistent with the literature .
20353611:35	However, other findings on the Sherbrooke Questionnaire (higher score with higher age, lower educational level and lower incomes) are well in line with the literature . Previous studies about the SPQ have reported positive results regarding the predictive validity of the SPQ [ , ], however, in the present study the SPQ showed less reliability and construct validity.
20353611:36	Conclusions about predictive validity can not be drawn for any of the three instruments.
20353611:37	The findings of the present study should be interpreted in the context of potential limitations.
20353611:38	First, little is known about the test-retest reliability of the instruments.
20353611:39	Second, there is no gold standard available as an external criterion of frailty.
20353611:40	Future studies could analyse the predictive validity of the frailty instruments with respect to disability, health service utilization and mortality.
20353611:41	Last, the SPQ was not fully used according to the protocol, as non-respondents were excluded from analyses.
20353611:42	According to the protocol of the SPQ , non-respondents should also be considered at risk (which would have resulted in a prevalence estimate of 67.0% instead of 59.1%).
20353611:43	The strengths of the present study are the comparisons of the psychometric properties of the frailty instruments, the proven feasibility of the postal procedure  and the response rate of 77.4%, which is as good as, or even better than, previous studies in which postal screening procedures were applied [ , ].
20353611:44	Although most older people may visit their GP regularly, primary care often fails in the identification of the health care needs of older people . Screening has the potential to identify older people at risk, followed by comprehensive assessment when needed . Frailty instruments have to provide reliable and valid answers and have to be feasible . The psychometric properties of the TFI were slightly better than those of the GFI.
20353611:45	However, the number of missing values was lower for GFI items than for TFI items, indicating a higher feasibility of the GFI.
20353611:46	Based on these findings it is not yet possible to conclude whether the GFI or the TFI should be preferred for postal screening.
20353611:47	The SPQ is less appropriate with regard to its psychometric quality and missing values.
20353611:48	The frailty index  is a simple measure that is based on self-reports.
20353611:49	However, less is known about its feasibility for postal screening.
20353611:50	Investigating the feasibility and validity of the frailty index as a postal screening instrument may be a point of interest for future research.
20353611:51	Future (longitudinal) research into the psychometric properties of the GFI and the TFI is urgently needed with regard to predictive validity and test-retest reliability of the GFI and the TFI.
20353611:52	In addition, comparing the GFI and the TFI with other frailty-related constructs would lead to more insight into their construct validity.
20353611:53	Conclusion 
Valid screening instruments for identifying community-dwelling frail older people are needed for disability prevention.
20353611:54	The GFI and the TFI have shown high internal consistency and construct validity, in contrast to the SPQ.
20353611:55	Prevalence estimates of frailty ranged from 40% to 59%.
20353611:56	Most agreement was found between the GFI and the TFI.
20353611:57	Based on these findings, it is not possible to conclude whether the GFI or the TFI should be preferred for screening.
20353611:58	The SPQ seems less appropriate.
20353611:59	Further research is needed.

21368868:0	Results 
GC-induced effects were investigated in parent NSCs (P1) exposed to 1  μ M Dex for 48 h, and in daughter cells (D) from passage 2 (D2) and 3 (D3), which were never directly exposed to Dex (see for details).
21368868:1	Discussion 
The novelty of our findings is the demonstration that, in NSCs, GCs induce heritable alterations, including a decrease in proliferation and changes in the expression of genes related to senescence and mitochondrial functions.
21368868:2	The decrease in global DNA methylation suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may have a critical role in the onset of Dex-induced effects.
21368868:3	In addition, both parent cells and D exhibited an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.
21368868:4	All together, the data open new translational perspectives.
21368868:5	Considering the central role that NSCs have in the developing nervous system, it is conceivable that, in vivo the alterations induced by GCs on cortical NSCs can negatively affect neurogenesis with a subsequent unfavourable functional outcome in terms of cognitive abilities.
21368868:6	Both human and animal studies have demonstrated that disruptions in prenatal and early postnatal brain development can cause mental retardation and cognitive dysfunctions, and disruption of developmental neurogenesis has been linked to schizophrenia.
21368868:7	It is well established that NSCs are also present in the adult nervous system, where they may have a role in learning, memory and in the response to injuries.
21368868:8	Thus, the long-lasting impairment induced by GCs in NSCs can have negative consequences in adulthood as well.
21368868:9	In terms of cellular mechanisms, the decrease in NSC number induced by Dex that we observed was not associated with an increase in cell death or differentiation, clearly pointing to an alteration in the proliferation rate, in agreement with Sundberg et al. Gene expression analyses revealed an upregulation of cell-cycle regulating genes p16 and p21 which represent potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and D-type cyclins in various cell types, thereby leading to cell cycle arrest.
21368868:10	By blocking GR with the non-selective antagonist Mifepristone or through knockdown experiments targeting GR expression, we could prevent the upregulation of both p16 and p21 . Gene expression regulation by GR can mechanistically occur in two distinct ways: (1) the ligand-activated GR interacts directly with GC-responsive elements (GREs) that are present in promoter regions of target genes; (2) GR-mediated stimulation of gene expression takes place by GR interaction with other DNA-bound proteins, without direct binding to the DNA itself or by interaction with other molecules involved in intracellular signalling.
21368868:11	For p21 GC-responsive regions have been identified in the rat promoter sequence that requires the presence of a C/EBP DNA binding site and the expression of a functional C/EBP α transcription factor.
21368868:12	Thus, Dex-induced p21 upregulation might be occurring via functional protein interactions between GR and C/EBP α in a tethering mechanism.
21368868:13	The upregulation of p16 and p21 has been linked to cellular and in vivo senescence, and our data point to Dex promoting senescence in NSCs, an effect that is passed from parent cells to D.
21368868:14	Cellular senescence is accompanied by SAHFs containing a variety of chromatin proteins, such as K9-methylated histone H3, macro H2A, HP1 and HMGA proteins.
21368868:15	Gene expression analyses of Hmga1 and protein analyses via immunocytochemistry against HP1 γ showed that both senescence markers are increased in daughter Dex-NSCs.
21368868:16	Further, we also detected a downregulation of Bmi1 that is also assumed to be an indicator of senescence based on the fact that normal embryonic fibroblasts from Bmi1 −/− mice show a premature senescence phenotype that correlates with an increased expression of p16 . 
Cellular senescence is associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions as shown in several different cell types, including fibroblasts, epithelial, mesothelial and hippocampal cells.
21368868:17	, Particularly, increased ROS content and decreased mitochondrial energetic competences to produce ATP are two major events underlined in the mitochondrial hypothesis of ageing.
21368868:18	Mitochondria are known to be a primary target of GCs, as the mitochondrial genome contains six putative GREs.
21368868:19	Gel shift analysis proved binding of the GR to the mitochondrial genome after GC challenge, which results in transcriptional regulation of several mitochondria-encoded genes.
21368868:20	In our cell model, we observed a transcriptional repression of the mitochondrial-respiratory chain enzymes of complex I ( Nd3 ) and complex III ( Cytb ) induced by Dex in parent cells and D.
21368868:21	Notably, a study on adrenalectomized rats has shown that several mitochondrial genes, including Cytb are GC responsive and are downregulated in response to low doses of corticosterone.
21368868:22	In our studies, all the effects induced by Dex persisted from parent cells to D.
21368868:23	The changes in global DNA methylation accompanied by a decreased expression of Dnmt1 Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b suggest that the heritable effects induced by Dex might be due to epigenetic reprogramming of NSCs.
21368868:24	The identification of gene-specific alterations in DNA methylation is the aim of ongoing studies.
21368868:25	In agreement with our previous data, Dex induces a long-lasting increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, as shown by the higher number of cells undergoing apoptosis, associated with higher levels of intracellular ROS.
21368868:26	However, the long-lasting alterations induced by GCs do not interfere with the viability of NSCs, unless they are challenged by an adverse stimulus, such as oxidative stress.
21368868:27	In conclusion, our data provide novel evidence for programming effects induced by Dex in NSCs and support the idea that conditions associated with fetal exposure to high levels of GCs are likely to have long-term consequences that may predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders and/or to neurodegenerative processes.

20696708:0	Introduction 
Different phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) under the control of kinase/phosphatase regulation are enriched in distinct membranes and direct localized cell functions.
20696708:1	A confounding issue in deciphering the relationship between PIP regulation and function is that different members of kinase/phosphatase families exhibit the same PIP selectivity in vitro, yet when mutated in vivo, are associated with specific diseases.
20696708:2	Myotubularins (MTMs) encode conserved phosphoinositide 3-phosphate phosphatases selective for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and PI(3,5)P 2 ( ; ; ) found as large gene families in metazoans (15 human, 7 fly, and 1 yeast; ; ; ).
20696708:3	MTM1 is associated with human myotubular myopathy, whereas the closely related MTMR2 is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, both characterized by distinct morphological defects.
20696708:4	In cell cultures, MTM1 and MTMR2 were detected on endosomes and isolated in complexes with the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) Vps34 ( ; ), which is consistent with MTM in vitro substrates and suggesting coordinated regulation of localized PIP pools.
20696708:5	However, the identity of the PIPs that require MTM1/MTMR2 in cells and the relationship to requirements in animals remain largely unexplored.
20696708:6	Membrane influx from distinct PI(3)P pools converges at late endosomes ( ; ).
20696708:7	PI(3)P is highly enriched on early endosomes with well-described roles defined by conserved Vps34 functions.
20696708:8	The recruitment of proteins with PI(3)P-binding domains mediate protein sorting, membrane transport, homotypic and heterotypic fusion with lysosomes, and endolysosomal maturation ( ; ; ; ).
20696708:9	PI(3)P is also considered central to autophagy, as demonstrated by an essential role for Vps34 in autophagosome formation and delivery of cytoplasmic content to endolysosomes for degradation ( ; ; ).
20696708:10	Additionally, PI(3)P pools generated by class II PI3-kinase isoforms restricted to metazoans are implicated in functions at the plasma membrane ( ; ; ; ; ; ), although with unknown endosomal roles.
20696708:11	Homeostasis of late endosomes depends on a balance between membrane influx and efflux that leads to diverging retrograde and recycling routes ( ; ).
20696708:12	Specificity in endocytic trafficking is emerging as a key site of regulation for many cellular and disease states ( ; ).
20696708:13	Thus, specific kinases and phosphatases may be dedicated to the synthesis and turnover of PI(3)P subpools that intersect at endosomes.
20696708:14	Drosophila melanogaster presents an ideal system to elucidate metazoan PIP regulation and the functional nexus between specific PIP regulators, substrate identities, and their cell developmental roles.
20696708:15	We demonstrate an important functional relationship between the single Drosophila MTM1/MTMR2 orthologue Mtm and the class II PI3-kinase Pi3K68D.
20696708:16	We show that Mtm and Pi3K68D coregulate PI(3)P to mediate endolysosomal flux and cortical dynamics in hemocytes, insect immune cells, and essential roles in animals.
20696708:17	Results 
Discussion 
We identified a class II Pi3K68D-dependent PI(3)P pool as a functional and likely direct Mtm substrate.
20696708:18	We demonstrated that Pi3K68D and mtm played major roles in the coregulation of a hemocyte PI(3)P pool and that both were necessary and sufficient for PI(3)P-mediated endolysosomal homeostasis.
20696708:19	Alternatively, mtm and Pi3K68D could interact through interconverted PIP pools, e.g., if class II PI3K synthesis of PI(3,4)P 2 led to inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase generation of endosomal PI(3)P.
20696708:20	Importantly, Pi3K68D loss of function suppressed multiple mtm -dependent hemocyte functions and essential roles in multiple tissues.
20696708:21	Our results suggest that a conserved pathway linking MTM1/MTMR2 and class II PI3-kinases could also be important for similar roles in mammals.
20696708:22	Expression of human MTMR2 in flies rescued the lethality associated with mtm depletion in different tissues, highlighting potential significance from use of the fly to better understand MTMR2 -related human disease.
20696708:23	Recent studies in T cells identified roles for PI3KC2α and MTMR6 in PI(3)P-mediated regulation of a calcium-activated K + channel, indicating that class II PI3-kinases may play broad and dedicated roles in conjunction with different MTM family members.
20696708:24	We found that a subset of mtm functions also shared interactions with class III PI3-kinase, Vps34 . The genetic interactions observed between mtm and Vps34 in PI(3)P and endolysosomal homeostasis, but not cell remodeling or essential functions in different tissues, suggest several possibilities.
20696708:25	Vps34 function may regulate a Pi3K68D function or be partially redundant with Pi3K68D for certain mtm functions; Vps34 may indirectly interact with mtm through converging PI(3)P membrane pools, and/or there may be additional essential consequences of Vps34 functions, e.g., that antagonize different MTM family member functions.
20696708:26	Similar partial and redundant interactions have been observed in Caenorhabditis elegans where reduction of mtm-1 rescued endocytosis defects but not lethality of vps-34 mutants, and increased apoptotic cell corpse engulfment upon mtm-1 depletion was found dependent on both vps-34 and the class II PIKI-1 functions.
20696708:27	We found that mtm was not only required for but could also promote cortical remodeling, specifically modulating cell protrusion formation.
20696708:28	MTMs have not previously been ascribed specific roles in cellular remodeling, although MTM1/MTMR2 and PI3KC2 isoforms have been associated with the cortex, and MTM1 overexpression led to cell protrusions.
20696708:29	Cortical F-actin organization and dynamics are under control of competing Rho GTPase activities, namely roles for Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 in lamellipodia versus protrusion formation.
20696708:30	A mutant form of MTM1 was detected at the plasma membrane upon constitutive Rac1 GTPase activation, mtm-1 was identified as a negative regulator of Rac-mediated engulfment, and Rho1 pathway hyperactivation resulted from combined essential function of ymr1 (MTM), sjl2 and sjl3 lipid phosphatases in yeast PI(3)P regulation.
20696708:31	However, PI3KC2β-expressing cell lysates exhibited increased levels of activated Cdc42, and PI3KC2α depletion interfered with Rho-mediated smooth muscle contraction.
20696708:32	Interestingly, endocytic trafficking of Rac was shown important for its spatially regulated activity.
20696708:33	Thus, one consequence of opposing Pi3K68D / mtm functions in hemocytes may be in the cortical balance of specific Rho GTPases, either through PI(3)P-mediated membrane trafficking or recruitment of PI(3)P-binding regulatory proteins to discrete membrane domains.
20696708:34	Our experiments show that Mtm has a role in policing traffic at the late endosome, which is consistent with a normal function to down-regulate membrane influx and promote efflux.
20696708:35	mtm was important to maintain the balance, but not ability, for membrane influx from endocytic and autophagic routes.
20696708:36	We found through genetic interactions, marker analysis, and time-lapse microscopy that mtm function antagonizes PI(3)P-mediated membrane flux consistent with known roles in transport, tethering, and fusion of endosomes with lysosomes and of autophagosomes with late endosomes.
20696708:37	Importantly, mtm -dependent functions for endolysosomal size and cortical remodeling were separable, as indicated by mtm interactions with Atg1 or Vps34 that rescued endolysosome size but not hemocyte protrusions.
20696708:38	Live cell imaging also revealed lack of dynamic tubulation, indicative of exiting membrane, in mtm -depleted hemocytes, suggesting that mtm function promotes undetermined routes of membrane efflux from PI(3)P-containing compartments.
20696708:39	In addition, several results point to a role for mtm in autophagy: the increased number of double-membrane–bound structures and autophagolysosomes in mtm -depleted cells, reversion of enlarged endolysosomal size with mtm and Atg1 codepletion, and Mtm localization to small rings associated with LysoTracker-positive organelles and within Rab7 compartments, suggestive of autophagosomes.
20696708:40	Given the PI(3)P dependence and intersection with endolysosomes, there are likely roles for MTM phosphatase regulation in autophagy.
20696708:41	Collectively, we favor a model that a PI(3)P pool directly coregulated by Pi3K68D-mediated synthesis and Mtm-mediated turnover is involved in membrane delivery and exit, respectively, at an endosomal compartment that maintains homeostasis of both cortical dynamics and endolysosome size.
20696708:42	Pi3K68D localization and motility suggest interaction at the level of dynamic PI(3)P pools synthesized at the cortex or on internal membranes.
20696708:43	The lack of cell protrusions upon mtm disruption could result from elevated Pi3K68D-dependent PI(3)P that inhibits membrane efflux to undefined recycling endosomes and, thus, blocks redelivery of a cortical regulator that promotes cell protrusions.
20696708:44	Pi3K68D overexpression did not phenocopy the lack of protrusions, which may indicate that Pi3K68D requires a limiting cofactor or scaffold protein or that levels of Mtm are sufficient to override ectopic activity.
20696708:45	Conversely, ectopic cell protrusions that form upon Mtm overexpression could result from inappropriate depletion of a Pi3K68D-synthesized PI(3)P pool that leads to excessive efflux, and, thus, persistent recycling of the same cortical regulator.
20696708:46	Consistent with this, an endosomal-tethered form of MTM1 was able to induce membrane tubulation.
20696708:47	In turn, mtm function down-regulates PI(3)P-mediated endosome transport, tethering, and fusion, restricting endolysosome size.
20696708:48	Our genetic analysis uncovered critical requirements for mtm - and phosphoinositide-dependent muscle and immune cell functions in Drosophila . Defects in remodeling cell shape upon either knockdown or overexpression of mtm both corresponded with defects in hemocyte dispersion and recruitment to wound sites.
20696708:49	These results indicate the significance of mtm -dependent cellular regulation to immune cell behaviors in the animal, analogous to those performed by mammalian macrophages in response to wounding and infection.
20696708:50	The identification of Pi3K68D-generated PI(3)P pools as a likely in vivo substrate of Mtm, and the specific cellular roles modulated by the balance of this pool in animals, has significance in better understanding roles for conserved MTM1/MTMR2 and PI3KC2 in mammals.
20696708:51	Our results highlight the potential that class II PI3K-activating mutations could underlie unassigned MTM-related human diseases.
20696708:52	Furthermore, class II PI3K could serve as a therapeutic target to oppose deleterious effects of MTM mutations associated with human disease.
17610725:0	Background 
Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease which affects multiple sites throughout the gastro-intestinal system.
17610725:1	The ocular manifestations are protean and commonly include episcleritis, scleritis and anterior uveitis.
17610725:2	Retinal vasculitis, optic neuropathy and multifocal choroiditis have also been reported [ - ].
17610725:3	In this report we describe a case of panuveitis with hypopyon in a patient with Crohn's disease in whom the presentation was attributable to a therapeutic agent and not the underlying systemic condition.
17610725:4	Methods 
A 56 year old male attended the eye clinic having awoken with blurred vision in his right eye; pain and photophobia were not present.
17610725:5	A 15 year history of Crohn's was reported – this was in remission following a year-long trial of 300 mg rifabutin daily with clarithromycin 250 mg daily.
17610725:6	Azathioprine had been discontinued by his rheumatologist 2 weeks previously.
17610725:7	The patient had never undergone gastro-intestinal surgery, there was no arthritis and no previous history of uveitis.
17610725:8	He was HLA-B27 negative.
17610725:9	At presentation the best corrected visual acuity was 6/24 OD and 6/6 OS.
17610725:10	There was a right anterior uveitis with 4 mm hypopyon (Figure ).
17610725:11	The IOP was 12 mmHg in both eyes.
17610725:12	There was moderate vitreous activity in the right eye; no features suggestive of retino-choroidal inflammation or vasculitis were detected and the optic disc was healthy.
17610725:13	The left eye was quiet, with no evidence of intra-ocular inflammation.
17610725:14	Blood tests including a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were all within the normal range, in keeping with a state of remission.
17610725:15	A diagnosis of right acute panuveitis was made and the patient was commenced on hourly topical dexamethasone 0.1% and cyclopentolate 1% twice daily.
17610725:16	The patient discontinued rifabutin, pending rheumatology review the following week.
17610725:17	Within three days, the hypopyon had reduced to 1 mm and the vision had improved to 6/9 in the right eye; a reducing course of dexamethasone was instituted.
17610725:18	One week after discontinuing rifabutin and clarithromycin, azathioprine 50 mg twice daily was restarted by his rheumatologist.
17610725:19	At 4 weeks, the IOP in the right eye had elevated to 38 mmHg – this was ascribed to steroid response and was managed using topical dorzolamide, timolol and by substituting dexamethasone for rimexolone 1% bd.
17610725:20	Following a further 8 weeks on this management, the anterior uveitis and ocular hypertension completely resolved and all topical medications were discontinued.
17610725:21	At this stage, the patient's inflammatory bowel disease was managed using azathioprine 50 mg twice daily, prednisolone 12.5 mg once a day and alendronate 70 mg once 
Discussion 
Acute anterior uveitis occurs in approximately 4% of patients with Crohn's disease.
17610725:22	Presentation with hypopyon is unusual and raises suspicion of either alternative systemic inflammatory disorders such as Behçet's or ankylosing spondylitis or, as in this case, an exogenous factor.
17610725:23	Hypopyon uveitis is well recognised following rifabutin therapy for mycobacterium avium intracellulare in both immuno-compromised and immuno-competent subjects.
17610725:24	In these reports, hypopyon could occur bilaterally and usually responded rapidly following commencement of topical corticosteroids, with or without reduction of rifabutin dosage.
17610725:25	Presentation with hypopyon often occurs several months after starting rifabutin.
17610725:26	In this case the presence of hypopyon, and rapid initial improvement following withdrawal of rifabutin, suggest rifabutin as the underlying aetiology.
17610725:27	There is a possibility that the recent discontinuation of azathioprine may have contributed to a generalised inflammatory relapse, of which the uveitis was part of; this was not, however, clinically apparent during the acute presentation.
17610725:28	The protracted subsequent recovery is atypical, although the steroid response will undoubtedly have contributed to this.
17610725:29	The use of rifabutin to treat Crohn's disease is not familiar to an ophthalmic readership; a previous case of anterior uveitis has been reported in the general medical literature only.
17610725:30	A suspected aetiology of exposure to Mycobacterium avium subspecies has been proposed in Crohn's disease.
17610725:31	A particular role for rifabutin has been noted in patients with proven evidence of Mycobacterium avium infection, although this was not the case in this subject.
17610725:32	Previous studies reported pharmacokinetic interactions when combining rifabutin and clarithromycin leading to an increase in rifabutin levels, resulting in an increase frequency of uveitis, this could explain the acute onset of uveitis in our case.
17610725:33	Conclusion 
The use of rifabutin to treat Crohn's disease is controversial and is currently used on a trial or named patient basis in the UK.
17610725:34	This report, however, does highlight the importance of keeping abreast of novel therapeutic developments in systemic conditions likely to be encountered by an ophthalmologist.

19668372:0	Introduction 
Human monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic viral exanthema with manifestations similar but less severe than smallpox . The virus (MPXV) belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family and shares many biochemical and physical properties with other orthopoxviruses, such as vaccinia and variola.
19668372:1	MPXV is thought to be maintained in wild rodents in the rain forests of Central and West Africa, causing sporadic human outbreaks in remote villages probably as a result of direct cutaneous contact or mucosal exposure to infected animals – . Because the airborne route of exposure is known to play a role in secondary human-to-human transmission concerns have been raised about the potential use of MPX as a biological warfare agent and as such, the virus is listed as a Category C select agent.
19668372:2	Monkeypox emerged for the first time in the Western Hemisphere in 2003, causing an outbreak in the Midwestern United States affecting 37 people that were exposed to ill prairie dogs purchased from pet stores or through pet swaps – . The virus entered the US upon the importation of exotic rodents from Ghana (West Africa).
19668372:3	Subsequent studies demonstrated the existence of two genetically distinct variants of the virus, called the West African and Congo Basin clades . The strain that caused the US outbreak belonged to the West African clade; which is associated with less severe disease as compared to the Congo Basin clade . 
Several animal models have been used to study MPXV pathogenesis, including newborn mice and rats cynomolgus monkeys , squirrels , prairie dogs , and dormice . Some of these studies were conducted using conventional methods involving large sample size and sacrificing animals to determine viral titers and histological changes.
19668372:4	In the present study, we describe the development of recombinant MPXV expressing the luciferase gene (MPXV-USA-Luc+, MPXV-Congo/Luc) and their use in monitoring disease progression in vivo with biophotonic imaging.
19668372:5	This technique has been used to study a variety of bacterial and viral infections – . Biophotonic imaging offers significant advantages over conventional pathogenesis studies because it can: 1) be used to quantitatively visualize viral infections in living animals; 2) allow disease progression and outcome to be directly linked to virus replication and virus load; 3) provide significant ethical advantages because experiments can be carried out with fewer animals; 4) result in faster data acquisition since images can be quantified within minutes; and 5) reveal unsuspected sites of viral replication and modes of viral spread.
19668372:6	Using luminescent MPX viruses, we compared disease progression in both immunocompetent and immuno-compromised mice between the West African and Congo clades via IP exposure.
19668372:7	This system could be used to address many questions about MPX pathogenesis, including virulence factors, disease progression in rodent hosts, and viral shedding from infected animals, an index of the transmission potential to humans and other animals.
19668372:8	In addition, these tools can be used to test anti-virals and the next generation of orthopoxvirus vaccines for their ability to alter the course of disease.
19668372:9	Results 
Discussion 
By constructing recombinant MPX viruses that expresses the luciferase gene (Luc+), we have characterized and compared the progression of disease in mice infected with MPXV-Congo and MPXV-USA strains.
19668372:10	In addition, we established appropriate animal models for further study of MPX viruses in general.
19668372:11	We found that 4-week-old immunocompetent BALB/c mice became ill after IP exposure to either the Congo or USA viruses but recovered fairly quickly from the infection.
19668372:12	In contrast, 4-week-old immunocompromised SCID-BALB/c mice were highly susceptible to MPXV, with infection resulting in 100% lethality for both the Congo and USA viruses.
19668372:13	Time-to-death in SCID BALB/c mice following IP infection was similar for the parental wild type (wt) and recombinant Luc+viruses for both the Congo and USA strains, indicating that insertion of the Luc+gene did not result in viral attenuation, but the Congo viruses have stronger replication and faster spread confirming previous reports regarding the increased virulence of this viral clade . Our studies are the first of this type to provide an extensive evaluation of MPXV infection and disease progression in well defined mouse laboratory strains.
19668372:14	Although previous work reported MPXV infection in newborn laboratory rats and mice the genetic background of the animals used in that study were not described.
19668372:15	The use of a recombinant MPX- Luc+viruses and biophotonic imaging provided significant advantages over conventional pathogenesis experiments involving tissue harvesting and titration studies to determine MPX disease progression and its correlation to virus replication/luminescence levels in the laboratory mouse model.
19668372:16	While the limit of detection by luminescence for our MPX-Luc+viruses is unknown, previous studies with Sindbis virus have shown to be approximately 10 3 PFU/g . Subsequent studies will focus in the validation of in vivo imaging through serial sacrifice studies and comparison of luminescence and viral levels in organs throughout the disease course.
19668372:17	Following IP inoculation of SCID mice, luminescence-indicative of MPXV-Luc+replication-was visible in the peritoneal cavity within 24 hours PI, and during early stages, the infection for both viral clades was limited to organs in the abdominal region.
19668372:18	Infection with MPXV-Congo-Luc+spread faster and by 96 hours was detected in lymph nodes in the axilliary region, whereas for MPXV-USA-Luc+only later (day 7-10) was luminescent signal visible in the nasal area, tail and feet.
19668372:19	It is unclear whether spread to these areas occurred following viremia facilitated by infected dendritic cells or through viral shedding in feces or urine.
19668372:20	For other poxviruses, such as ectromelia, the skin is the primary site of viral infection . 
In vivo imaging of SCID mice injected IP revealed a very high tropism of MPXV for ovarian tissues.
19668372:21	This result was confirmed by the high viral titers (>10 5 PFU) measured in ovaries of infected mice and IHC studies that showed ovaries had the most intense and diffuse staining compared to other tissues.
19668372:22	A previous study in non-human primates also reported detection of MPXV antigen in ovarian tissues but it was not a primary site of viral replication.
19668372:23	The extent of viral spread in SCID BALB/c mice was affected by the viral clade.
19668372:24	Inoculation by the IP route of both viral clades resulted initially in infection of organs in the peritoneal cavity.
19668372:25	Then, for MPXV-Congo-Luc+, infection resulted in a more disseminated spread and luminescence signal was detected in the entire body.
19668372:26	While these studies provide new knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of MPXV in the laboratory mouse, the relevance of this model when compared to human monkeypox disease and non-human primate model remains to be seen.
19668372:27	Following IP inoculation, mice developed a systemic disease and virus was detected in multiple organs, including lungs, kidneys and ovaries.
19668372:28	Furthermore, in vivo imaging showed significant viral replication in the skin (tail, feet), producing multiple well-defined pustule lesions with the presence of Guarneri inclusion bodies as confirmed by histology and immunhistochemistry.
19668372:29	However, no clinical signs of rash were observed in infected animals, suggesting that this model might not be completely comparable to human monkeypox disease.
19668372:30	The IP route of inoculation was used in this initial study in order to provide a highly consistent dose of virus to establish imaging procedures.
19668372:31	Parenteral routes of infection (intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, footpad) have been used by others to establish MPXV animal models in non-human primates, squirrels, prairie dogs and dormice , . In future studies, the intranasal route will be used since this route simulates natural infection with MPXV.
19668372:32	The marked difference in pathogenesis observed between SCID mice and immune-competent BALB/c mice provides an opportunity to investigate the immune responses that protect against MPXV infection.
19668372:33	Because luminescence in the immunocompetent BALB/c mice peaked at 96 hours post-infection, early events in the host immune response are probably important in controlling MPXV infection.
19668372:34	While SCID mice lack of T or B cell responses, they can fully mount innate (e.g cytokines) immune responses.
19668372:35	In subsequent studies we will compare these innate responses between immunocompetent and SCID BALB/c mice in an attempt to elucidate their role in MPXV infection.
19668372:36	Studies with vaccinia have demonstrated the importance of interferon in viral spread and pathogenesis since IN infection in mice lacking receptors for type I interferons (IFN I R −/−) resulted in more systemic spread into abdominal organs . There is little consensus at the present about the correlates of protection in animals infected with MPXV or other related poxviruses.
19668372:37	Most of the understanding of the host response to poxvirus infection in humans comes from historical clinical data collected from smallpox patients and vaccinated individuals.
19668372:38	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and antibody responses are associated with virus control in vaccinia-vaccinated individuals and those who have previously recovered from smallpox .
19668372:39	Patients with abnormalities in T-cell function developed generalized vaccinia, whereas patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia did not .
19668372:40	There is also a growing appreciation of the importance of antibody in virus control and animal recovery in other models of both primary and secondary poxvirus infections.
19668372:41	In macaques, vaccinia vaccination induced protection against a lethal intravenous challenge with MPXV . Animals depleted of B cells were susceptible to infection, but not if they were depleted of either CD4 or CD8 T cells . 
In addition to their use for the study of MPXV pathogenesis, these luciferase-expressing viruses in combination with in vivo animal models can also provide important tools in the development of novel anti-orthopoxvirus therapeutics.
19668372:42	Similar studies have been conducted using luminescent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) . No antiviral drug has been proven to be effective in the treatment of human smallpox.
19668372:43	The only antiviral agent currently approved for use against orthopoxviruses is cidofovir .
19668372:44	However, this compound has low oral bioavailability and must be administered intravenously, limiting its usefulness.
19668372:45	The recombinant MPXV-Luc+viruses we constructed appear to be highly stable and fully virulent.
19668372:46	After sequence analyses, we selected several MPXV intergenic regions, including 141–142 and 176–177, as the sites for Luc+insertion.
19668372:47	The primary factors involved in the selection of these regions included the lack of potential promoter sequences and also sufficient distance from nearby genes, thus decreasing the chance of functional disruption by the foreign gene insertion.
19668372:48	Although we initially inserted the luciferase gene into the 141–142 region, the resulting virus had reduced virulence compared to the parental virus in SCID mice (data not shown).
19668372:49	The recombinant MPXV-Luc+used in this study was created using the 176–177 intergenic region.
19668372:50	Following five rounds of plaque purification, and pathogenesis studies in 12 animals, the luciferase insert was still present in the recombinant viruses as shown by luminescence and sequence data, indicating that the MPXV-Luc+were stable and the 176–177 intergenic region can efficiently maintain the foreign gene.
19668372:51	In addition, i n vitro experiments, such as one-step growth curves, and in vivo virulence studies in mice showed that recombinant Luc+viruses maintained the phenotypic and virulence properties of the parental viruses.
19668372:52	Another advantage of the Luc+insertion is the ability to use the marker to quantify virus in animal tissues.
19668372:53	We found a strong correlation between luminescence in tissue extracts from infected mice and viral titers quantified by traditional plaque assays.
19668372:54	This finding can be used in future studies for faster quantification of virus loads, avoiding the significant biohazard involved in harvesting and processing tissues for viral titration, particularly for select agents such as MPXV.
19668372:55	Unfortunately, quantification of virus using this method is not as sensitive as plaque assays and molecular techniques (real time PCR).
19668372:56	However, the ability to monitor animals longitudinally compensates for the loss in sensitivity compared to that of the plaque assay and adds the dimension of time to disease progression and pathogenicity studies.
19668372:57	In summary, we have constructed highly stable recombinant MPXV- Luc+viruses that can be used in biophotonic imaging studies to provide further insight into MPXV pathogenesis and host response to infection.
19668372:58	The availability of these viruses also provide a unique opportunity to study MPXV infection in known wild rodent hosts from Africa as well as prairie dogs and other U.S. rodents that could serve as hosts of the virus if subsequent introductions of the virus occur.
19668372:59	In future studies, we will use luciferase-expressing viruses to study pathogenesis via IN and other routes of infection and to better assess the role of specific genes in the pathogenesis of MPXV.
19668372:60	A recent study suggested that several genes, including D10L, D14L, B10R, B14R and B19R might play an important role in MPXV virulence . Understanding the factors that increase MPXV virulence can aid the development of vaccines and anti-virals that could be used to prevent or treat human monkeypox.
19668563:0	Introduction 
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy leading to permanent visual loss that is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
19668563:1	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma.
19668563:2	Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is an important subset of POAG; while many POAG patients have high IOP, patients with NTG have statistically normal IOP.
19668563:3	– The prevalence of NTG is higher among the Japanese population than among Caucasians, and recent studies reported that 92% of POAG patients in Japan had NTG.
19668563:4	– The diagnosis of glaucoma is based on a combination of factors including optic nerve damage and specific field defects for which IOP is the only treatable risk factor.
19668563:5	NTG, however, tends to be underdiagnosed because of an accompanying high myopia in many cases and the lack of elevated IOP.
19668563:6	Although relatively higher IOP, myopia, and older age are known to be factors associated with the development of NTG, they are not pathognomonic and there remains a growing interest in the identification of pathogenetic factors associated with NTG.
19668563:7	Glaucoma is genetically heterogeneous and the detection of susceptibility genes could provide useful information for early diagnosis of glaucoma.
19668563:8	To date, over 30 genetic loci for glaucoma have been identified by linkage analysis in multiple pedigrees; – 14 loci of POAG, 3 loci of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), and 1 locus of pigment dispersion syndrome have been designated GLC1A-GLC1N, GLC3A-GLC3C, and GPDS1 (with approval from the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee), respectively.
19668563:9	Among them, GLC3A harbors cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1).
19668563:10	CYP1B1 sapans 8.5 kb on chromosome 2p21 with three exons, and mutation of this gene is a major cause of PCG.
19668563:11	Most CYP1B1 mutations are genetic insertions, deletions, or missense mutations, indicating that CYP1B1 is relatively susceptible to recombination events.
19668563:12	CYP1B1 has also been found to be involved in the development of juvenile-onset glaucoma (juvenile open angle glaucoma [JOAG]).
19668563:13	– In addition, recent studies have shown that CYP1B1 mutations are related to POAG in several ethnic groups, and there have been reports of delayed expression of a CYP1B1 mutation and coexistence of PCG and POAG in the same pedigree.
19668563:14	These recent studies suggest that CYP1B1 mutations in the GLC3A locus may contribute to a broader range of glaucoma phenotypes than the PCG phenotype alone, including NTG.
19668563:15	In this study, with prospective SNP analysis of the CYP1B1 gene in NTG patients in mind, we performed comprehensive microsatellite mapping in and around the GLC3A locus and investigated the disease-susceptibility of this locus in NTG patients.

19668563:17	The mean refraction value was −3.74 ± 3.02 diopters (D), and the mean deviation observed in the Humphrey ® static visual field determination (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany) was −10.14 ± 8.04 dB.
19668563:18	We genotyped 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers in and around the GLC3A locus in 142 patients and 101 controls (Figure ).
19668563:19	The observed and expected frequencies of each genotype for the 13 markers in the case and control subjects were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (data not shown).
19668563:20	Only two adjacent markers, D2S0416i and D2S0425i, were significantly positive, as shown in Table and the frequency of the 444 allele of D2S0416i and the 258 allele of D2S0425i were decreased in cases compared to controls (P = 0.022, OR = 0.59 and P = 0.034, OR = 0.42, respectively).
19668563:21	However, this statistical significance disappeared (Pc > 0.05) when evaluated by Bonferroni correction.
19668563:22	The magnitude of LD between these two markers was low, with pair-wise D’ = 0.25, and the comparison of haplotype consisting of two alleles (D2S0416i_444 and D2S0425i_258) rendered no significant difference between cases and controls (cases vs controls = 3.5% vs 7.3%, P = 0.055) (data not shown).
19668563:23	Discussion 
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the GLC3A locus is associated with NTG in Japanese subjects, based on results from recent studies reporting that the CYP1B1 gene, located at the GLC3A locus on chromosome 2p21, could be a causative gene in POAG as well as PCG.
19668563:24	To this end, we genotyped 13 microsatellite markers in and around the GLC3A locus.
19668563:25	Here we report a lack of association between the GLC3A locus and NTG in Japanese patients, suggesting that genetic variation at this locus may not play an important role in the development of NTG.
19668563:26	Sarfarazi and colleagues mapped GLC3A as a putative PCG locus to 2p21 in 11 Turkish families, and the D2S177 microsatellite, located 270 kb telomeric to the CYP1B1 gene, showed a maximal LOD score of 9.40.
19668563:27	Bejjani and colleagues also reported that the maximal LOD score was 15.76 with D2S177 in 25 Saudi Arabian PCG families.
19668563:28	Recently, it has been reported that the D2S177 allele was associated with CYP1B1 mutations related to PCG.
19668563:29	Therefore, D2S177 may be potentially useful as a marker for genetic events associated with glaucoma, such as CYP1B1 mutations.
19668563:30	In the present study, we did not find any significant association between D2S177 alleles and NTG, suggesting that CYP1B1 mutations may not be a risk factor for NTG.
19668563:31	It has been hypothesized that mutations of CYP1B1 cause developmental abnormality in the structure and function of the anterior ocular segment.
19668563:32	However, NTG patients have statistically normal IOP with no abnormality in the structure of anterior ocular segment, suggesting that CYP1B1 is a potential disease susceptibility gene of PCG, POAG, and JOAG, but not NTG.
19668563:33	On the other hand, we found a weak association between two adjacent markers, D2S0416i and D2S0425i, and NTG, although this link did not reach statistical significance when corrected.
19668563:34	These two markers were located ∼860 kb centromeric to the CYP1B1 gene.
19668563:35	The nearest gene of D2S0416i is the SOS1 (son of sevenless homolog 1 [Drosophila]) gene, which is about 40 kb from the marker.
19668563:36	SOS1 encodes a protein that is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS proteins, and mutations in this gene are associated with gingival fibromatosis and Noonan syndrome.
19668563:37	– Another marker, D2S0425i, is within the CDKL4 (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 4) gene, a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
19668563:38	Currently, there are no reports suggesting any connection between these two genes and NTG.
19668563:39	Previous studies reported that mutations in genes such as optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), – apolipoprotein E (APOE), and optineurin (OPTN) – are implicated in NTG.
19668563:40	Recently, WD repeat-domain 36 (WDR36), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and β-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) have also been reported as risk factors for NTG.
19668563:41	However, associations between these genes and NTG were not strong or not often replicated in other populations, – suggesting that there may be other unknown genetic factors having more powerful effects on the development of NTG than those identified so far.
19668563:42	In conclusion, we performed an association analysis of the GLC3A locus including the CYP1B1 gene using microsatellite markers in NTG patients, but the marker involved in NTG was not detected in this locus.
19668563:43	In NTG patients, diagnosis is usually made after a visual field defect has occurred, due to few subjective symptoms and normal IOP.
19668563:44	Therefore it is necessary to identify a disease susceptibility gene and elucidate pathogenic mechanisms of NTG for early diagnosis, prevention, and therapeutic development.

20413934:0	Case Report 
A 13-year-old female patient reported in June 2007 with complaints of a slowly growing painless swelling in the lateral fornix of the left eye of six months duration . There was no history of trauma, pain, and lacrimation, restriction of ocular movements or impairment of vision.
20413934:1	No other swelling was present elsewhere in the body.
20413934:2	Systemic examination showed no abnormality.
20413934:3	Examination of the left eye revealed a firm, nodular, nontender, nonpulsatile, irreducible swelling in the lateral canthus.
20413934:4	The conjunctiva over the swelling was freely movable.
20413934:5	On adduction the swelling indented the eyeball.
20413934:6	There was mild conjunctival congestion over the swelling.
20413934:7	Ocular examination was otherwise within normal limits with visual acuity of 20/20.
20413934:8	Ocular movements were full and free.
20413934:9	Right eye examination was within normal limits.
20413934:10	Relevant investigations consisting of hemogram, total and differential counts (done to exclude infective etiology) were within normal limits.
20413934:11	Non-contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scan of orbits revealed a homogenous soft tissue density mass in the lateral canthus of the left eye not infiltrating the surrounding tissues, suggestive of a benign tumor.
20413934:12	Ultrasonography showed medium to high reflectivity with moderate sound attenuation with well-defined contour suggestive of a dermoid.
20413934:13	The lesion was explored by a vertical incision in the conjunctiva overlying the swelling.
20413934:14	A similar incision was made on the Tenon's capsule and a firm slightly lobulated swelling, free from other structures was found deep in the lateral fornix which was removed in toto by blunt dissection with an intact capsule .
20413934:15	This tumor had no connection with any other structure in the orbit.
20413934:16	The tumor measured 2×1.5×1cm . The Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva were closed in layers.
20413934:17	The postoperative period was uneventful.
20413934:18	Histopathology revealed the tissue to be a pleomorphic adenoma showing a biphasic cellular nature.
20413934:19	The tumor tissue comprised epithelial elements arranged as trabeculae, glands and cysts.
20413934:20	Foci of squamous metaplasia were present.
20413934:21	The epitheloid cells were cuboidal to columnar.
20413934:22	The stroma was chondromyxoid.
20413934:23	No malignant component was present .
20413934:24	The stain used was hematoxylin-eosin.
20413934:25	The patient has been observed for more than one year with no recurrence of the swelling.
20413934:26	Discussion 
Lacrimal gland tissue is present in the orbital and palpebral lobes of the lacrimal gland, in the accessory glands of Krause and Wolfring.
20413934:27	Ectopic lacrimal gland tissue may be found in the caruncle, bulbar conjunctiva, outer canthus, and lower lid, intraorbital and intraocular regions and in any location in and around the eye.
20413934:28	In this patient, ectopic lacrimal gland was present beneath the bulbar conjunctiva.
20413934:29	The lacrimal gland develops from basal conjunctival cells as solid buds at eight weeks gestation.
20413934:30	These buds gradually migrate and finally come to lie in the lacrimal gland fossa.
20413934:31	The tissue continues to grow after birth and complete differentiation occurs only after three years of age.
20413934:32	The accessory lacrimal glands are similarly formed as ectodermal evaginations of the conjunctiva.
20413934:33	During this process of development a part of the gland may get sequestered and develop separately, unconnected to the main mass of the lacrimal gland.
20413934:34	Various other theories for the development of ectopic lacrimal tissue have also been propounded – implantation of lacrimal tissue with surface epithelium during lens formation, lacrimal gland buds being pinched off during closure of the choroidal fissure especially when they are in close proximity and intraocular extension of lacrimal tissue along preexisting scleral defects which may close later.
20413934:35	There can also be epithelial- mesenchymal interaction in which FGF-10, inductive signal intensity for the lacrimal gland acts directly on the conjunctival epithelium stimulating it to proliferate.
20413934:36	Pleomorphic adenomas in the orbit can be found in the lacrimal gland, palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland associated with raised intraocular pressure, in the upper lid, in the lower lid developing in Krause's gland, lacrimal sac and orbit.
20413934:37	The current tumor had no connection with the lacrimal gland and was situated deep in the subconjunctival tissue in the lateral fornix; it most likely was a tumor arising from ectopic lacrimal tissue.
20413934:38	The palpebral portion of the lacrimal gland anatomically is so placed that its anterior border lies just above the outer part of the upper fornix and can be seen in this situation through the conjunctiva when the upper lid is everted (Wolff's Anatomy).
20413934:39	The current tumor was present in the lateral fornix as shown by an arrow in Fig.
20413934:40	a.
20413934:41	Unusual presentations of pleomorphic adenomas have also been reported in the literature.
20413934:42	Christie et al. (1995) excised a well-circumscribed mass from the lacrimal gland fossa of the right orbit of a 57-year-old woman which was found to be a combination of a small benign mixed tumor and a large ductal cyst of the lacrimal gland.
20413934:43	A giant pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland that concealed a blind eye for six years in a 24-year-old, seen protruding from the superolateral left upper lid was excised by Guerra et al.  
In this patient, pleomorphic adenoma developed in ectopic lacrimal gland tissue at the age of 13 years whereas it is usually found between the 30-70 years.
20413934:44	Cases of pleomorphic adenoma have also been found between 6-80 years of age.
20413934:45	This is an unusual and rare presentation of pleomorphic adenoma in an ectopic lacrimal gland tissue in a young female, presenting subconjunctivally.
20413934:46	Literature was searched through search engines Pubmed, Google and Yahoo in all languages, with key words ectopic lacrimal gland for which references were obtained.
20413934:47	These stated that ectopic lacrimal tissue can occur in lids, caruncle, bulbar conjunctiva, outer canthus, intraocular and intraorbital regions proving this tumor originate from ectopic lacrimal tissue.
20413934:48	Histopathologically it was pleomorphic adenoma.
20413934:49	There was no reference to pleomorphic adenoma in ectopic lacrimal gland in children by the above search engines and standard textbooks by Henderson's orbital tumors, DM Albert and FA Jackobiec and Char DH.

1. Effect of Levosimendan on Slow Force Response to Sudden Stretch in Isolated Rat Papillary Muscle.
null:1	OLEG LOOKIN, R. LISIN, and YURI LEONIDOVICH PROTSENKO, Institute of Immunology and Physiology of Russian Academy of Science, Ekaterinburg 620219, Russia 
We tested whether change of Ca sensitivity of TnC is involved to slow force response (SFR) in health cardiac muscle.
null:2	For that, we used levosimendan (LS).
null:3	Rat RV papillary muscles were suddenly stretched from 85 to 95% of L MAX, and force and calcium transient were measured during SFR in control solution and at 0.1, 1, and 10 μM LS.
null:4	Muscles were washed in Krebs (25°C, 0.33 Hz) with 1.1 and 2.5 mM [Ca 2+] o to evaluate the effect of calcium sensitization on SFR at different Ca-saturation levels.
null:5	LS decreased twitch force on any stage of SFR, but more pronouncedly at pre-stretch length and in lesser degree immediately after stretch.
null:6	Regardless of [Ca 2+] o and stage of SFR, LS significantly and dose dependently decreased time-to-peak tension and accelerated twitch relaxation, with no effect to peak [Ca 2+] i.
null:7	Nevertheless, LS dose dependently increased T 80 and decreased T 20 of Ca transient relaxation.
null:8	Regardless of [Ca 2+] o concentration, SFR was either biphasic (fast initial rise, slow fall until steady state) or triphasic (fast initial rise, slow fall, slow rise).
null:9	Some preparations showed apparent LS dose-dependent increase of total SFR, whereas others showed the opposite effect.
null:10	We have fitted fast initial rise of SFR by the equation F(t) = A*(1−e Bt).
null:11	At all LS, the A parameter (amplitude) was significantly increased to ∼130% relatively control, whereas the B parameter (time constant) was lower than in control (not significantly).
null:12	The effect was not dependent on [Ca 2+] o.
null:13	Therefore, fast force response to sudden stretch (during ∼30 s) in rat myocardium might be at least partially due to changed Ca sensitivity of TnC to Ca 2+.
null:14	Slow response (several minutes after stretch) is caused by slow dynamics of intracellular Ca 2+ rather than further change in Ca sensitivity.
null:15	It is also possible that in the range of 0.1 to 10 μM, LS acts not only as a calcium sensitizer, but it also increases cAMP levels, which could explain accelerated relaxation.
null:16	2. Dystrophin and Utrophin Have Distinct Effects on the Microsecond Dynamics of Actin.

null:18	THOMAS, Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 
Dystrophin and utrophin bind actin in vitro with similar affinities, but with different molecular contacts.
null:19	These differences are proposed to alter the elasticity of actin-dystrophin and actin-utrophin linkages to the sarcolemma, affecting the cell's response to muscle stretches.
null:20	To test this hypothesis, we have determined the effects of dystrophin and utrophin on the microsecond dynamics of erythrosin iodoacetamide–labeled actin using transient phosphorescence anisotropy (TPA).
null:21	Binding of dystrophin or utrophin to actin resulted in significant changes in the TPA decay.
null:22	At a low level of actin saturation (≤20%), both proteins induced similar changes in actin dynamics, but at higher levels of saturation, utrophin was more effective than dystrophin and induced more pronounced changes in the final anisotropy, correlation time, and initial anisotropy of actin.
null:23	The simplest interpretation of these changes is that utrophin restricted the amplitude and increased the rates of motion of the probe to a substantially larger extent than dystrophin.
null:24	Further analysis indicated that the actin–utrophin complex is much more torsionally flexible than the actin–dystrophin complex.
null:25	In addition, individual regions along the full-length proteins have unique properties that contribute differently to the effects on actin dynamics.
null:26	Preliminary data on fragments containing all the proposed actin binding domains (DN-R17/UN-R10) show less effect on regulating rotational amplitude and nearly no effect on rotational rate.
null:27	Future experiments will investigate other fragments of dystrophin and utrophin and their functionally relevant mutants to determine which structural elements of these proteins are critical in determining the flexibility of actin filaments, and what level of actin flexibility is physiologically optimal.
null:28	In addition, site-directed labeling of dystrophin and utrophin will permit spectroscopic analysis of these proteins' structural dynamics when free and bound to actin.
null:29	These results will greatly aid in both understanding the pathophysiology of DMD and optimizing therapeutic designs using micro-dystrophin/micro-utrophin or antisense oligonucleotides.

An in vitro motility assay with regulated thin filaments was applied to assess a modulatory role of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) on myosin motion regulation.
null:36	A series of experiments was performed to obtain dependences of thin filament movement velocity on calcium concentration in solution (in the range of pCa = 5 to pCa = 8).
null:37	Rabbit cardiac myosin with and without rabbit cMyBP-C was used.
null:38	Corresponding “pCa–velocity” curves revealed sigmoid form.
null:39	Insertion of cMyBP-C to the motility assay affected distinctly thin filament sliding velocities at maximal calcium levels.
null:40	Particularly, adding 130 nM cMyBP-C resulted in a 43% slowing of thin filament speed at saturating calcium concentration (pCa = 5) as compared with regulated thin filaments without cMyBP-C (2.08 ± 0.12 μm/s vs. 3.65 ± 0.04 μm/s, respectively).
null:41	The presence of cMyBP-C did not change calcium sensitivity estimated as pCa50 (pCa value corresponding to half maximum velocity).
null:42	Hill coefficients of cooperativity ( h ) were determined for pCa–velocity relationships.
null:43	The value of h did not differ significantly due to the cMyBP-C addition and varied around 6.
null:44	Our data found in the experiments with cardiac myosin are in good agreement with the results obtained with skeletal myosin by others (Saber, W., K.J. Begin, D.M.
null:45	Warshaw, and P. VanBuren.
null:46	2008. J. Mol.

null:53	Harris.
null:54	2006. J. Biol.Chem . 281:35846–35854).
null:55	Thus, the addition of cMyBP-C to the motility assay using both cardiac and skeletal myosin resulted in the slowing of thin filament velocity at a saturating calcium concentration.
null:56	However, our experimental model seems to be more relevant to the acto–myosin interaction in intact cardiomyocytes.
null:57	This work was supported by Program 27 of Presidium RAS.
null:58	4. Insights into Myosin Function Based on the Kinetic and Structural Data.
null:59	H. LEE SWEENEY University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104 
The sliding of actin and myosin filaments was proposed as the basis of force generation and shortening in striated muscle.
null:60	Although this is now generally accepted, the detailed molecular mechanism of how myosin uses ATP to generate force during its cyclic interaction with actin is only now being unraveled.
null:61	New insights have come from the unconventional myosins, especially myosin V and, more recently, myosin VI.
null:62	These myosins are kinetically tuned to allow movement on actin filaments as a single, dimeric molecule, which has led to new kinetic, mechanical, and structural data that have filled in missing pieces of the actomyosin–chemo–mechanical transduction puzzle.
null:63	5. The Actomyosin Motor: Structure, Function, and Modulation, One Molecule at a Time.
null:64	DAVID M. WARSHAW University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, 05405 
Myosin is a double-headed molecular motor that cyclically interacts with actin to generate force and motion with the energy derived from its hydrolysis of ATP.
null:65	Using a combination of single molecule biophysical techniques and structural mutagenesis, critical domains of the myosin motor have been identified that are essential for force and motion generation as well as effective communication between its two heads.
null:66	With this knowledge, the molecular consequences of point mutations in both myosin and actin that lead to genetic forms of human cardiomyopathies can be understood.

6. During Muscle Atrophy, Components of the Thick, But Not Thin, Filaments Are Degraded by MuRF1-dependent Ubiquitylation.
null:68	SHENHAV COHEN, JEFFREY J. BRAULT, STEVEN P. GYGI, DAVID J. GLASS, DAVID M. VALENZUELA, CARLOS GARTNER, ESTHER LATRES, and ALFRED L. GOLDBERG, Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115 
Loss of myofibrillar proteins is a hallmark of atrophying muscle.
null:69	Expression of MuRF1, a ubiquitin ligase, is markedly induced during atrophy, and MuRF1 deletion attenuates muscle wasting.
null:70	We generated mice expressing a Ring-deletion mutant MuRF1, which binds but cannot ubiquitylate substrates.
null:71	Mass spectrometry of the bound proteins in denervated muscle identified many myofibrillar components.
null:72	Upon denervation or fasting, atrophying muscles show a loss of myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) and myosin light chains 1 and 2 (MyLC1 and MyLC2) from the myofibril before any measurable decrease in myosin heavy chain (MyHC).
null:73	Their selective loss requires MuRF1.
null:74	MyHC is protected from ubiquitylation in myofibrils by associated proteins, but it eventually undergoes MuRF1-dependent degradation.
null:75	In contrast, MuRF1 ubiquitylates MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2, even in myofibrils.
null:76	Because these proteins stabilize the thick filament, their selective ubiquitylation may facilitate thick filament disassembly.
null:77	However, the thin filament components decreased by a mechanism not requiring MuRF1.
null:78	7. The Mechanical Properties of Titin Molecules Isolated from the Failing Heart.

null:80	TRAFFORD, School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, England, UK 
The passive stiffness of cardiac muscle is primarily determined by the giant protein titin.
null:81	Alterations in the ratio of the relatively stiff (N2B) to compliant (NB2BA) titin isoforms have been indentified in both coronary artery disease and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in the presence of decreased titin-based passive stiffness (Makarenko, I., C.A.

null:94	It has been proposed, therefore, that changes in the mechanical properties of titin play a major role in the etiology of heart disease.
null:95	This study aimed to determine if the tensile strength of isolated titin molecules is altered in the failing heart.
null:96	Heart failure was induced in adult male ferrets by ascending aortic coarctation (Graham, H.K., and A.W.
null:97	Trafford.
null:98	2007.
null:99	Am. J. Physiol. 292:H1364–H1372).
null:100	All procedures accorded with The UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986.
null:101	Titin molecules were isolated from the left ventricle (Soteriou, A., M. Gamage, and J. Trinick. 1993. J.
null:102	Cell Sci. 104:119–123) and aligned and stretched by a molecular combing technique that uses a receding meniscus to apply a tensile force of ∼60 p N (Tskhovrebova, L., and J. Trinick. 1997. J. Mol. Biol. 265:100–106; Sherratt, M.J., C. Baldock, J.L.

null:109	2003. J. Mol. Biol. 332:183–193).
null:110	After molecular combing, titin molecules were visualized by atomic force microscopy.
null:111	In contrast to noncombed molecules, combed titin appeared straightened and beaded with discernable filaments between beads.
null:112	The mean molecular diameter of titin (calculated as height above substrate) was decreased in failing hearts compared with control (0.26 ± 0.001 vs. 0.33 ± 0.001 nm; P < 0.001; n = 104–130 molecules, 3 animals per group).
null:113	This difference was more pronounced in the shorter molecules (<3.5 μm).
null:114	The mean distance between beads was increased in failing hearts (49.3 ± 1.5 vs. 126.8 ± 4.5 nm; P < 0.001; n = 370–429, 3 animals per group).
null:115	No significant difference was observed in the mean contour lengths of titin from sham and heart failure tissue after molecular combing.
null:116	In conclusion, the decreased titin molecular diameter combined with an increased inter-bead distance suggests that titin from failing hearts is less resistant to tensile forces when compared with control, and it may help to explain the decreased titin-based passive tension observed in diseased hearts.
null:117	8. Myosin Binding Protein C Function in Cardiac Muscle.
null:118	SAMANTHA P. HARRIS JUSTIN F. SCHAFFER, and KRISTINA L. BEZOLD, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95618 
Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a thick filament protein of vertebrate sarcomeres that limits cross-bridge cycling kinetics and reduces myocyte power output.
null:119	Mutations in the gene encoding cardiac MyBP-C are a leading cause of inherited cardiomyopathies, but the mechanisms by which MyBP-C affects cardiac function and by which mutations in cMyBP-C cause disease are not well understood.
null:120	Here, we investigated the ability of the first four N-terminal domains (C0-C1-motif-C2) of cardiac (c) MyBP-C to affect actomyosin interactions and to interact with actin.
null:121	Recombinant proteins containing the C1 and motif domains increased Ca 2+ sensitivity of tension and increased rates of tension redevelopment ( k tr) at submaximal [Ca 2+] in permeabilized rat trabeculae.
null:122	Proteins containing these domains also biphasically activated and then inhibited the Ca 2+-activated ATPase rates of heavy meromyosin and myosin S1 in solution.

null:128	JOHN HEUSER, LUCY LOULTCHEVA, TANYA TENKOVA, and ROBYN ROTH, Department of Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, and Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan 
We will advance the hypothesis in this poster that muscle T-tubules are uniquely vulnerable to damage during eccentric contractions, and that the muscle protein dysferlin plays a special role in stabilizing T-tubule connections with the plasma membrane, or reestablishing connections with the plasma membrane if and when T-tubules are damaged by this sort of contraction.
null:129	Further, we will illustrate that the reason for this T-tubule vulnerability, which is unique to muscle, is due to the fact that the surface membrane of the muscle fiber, the sarcolemma, is pinned down to the special extracellular matrix that surrounds all muscle fibers and stabilizes them, so the surface membrane cannot slip laterally.
null:130	We will then illustrate how the T-tubule system, which connects everywhere to the sarcolemma to spread excitation throughout the muscle fiber, is itself pinned down to certain positions in the myofilament lattice of the internal sarcoplasmic contractile apparatus.
null:131	These competing physical constraints, we will argue, mean that whenever the internal myofilament lattice becomes displaced laterally from its natural starting point distribution relative to the surrounding sarcolemma (as it likely does during eccentric contraction), the T-tubule origins and insertions must become stretched and, consequently, T-tubules become vulnerable to rupture or evulsion from the cell surface.
null:132	We will further illustrate how and why this sort of T-tubule evulsion would interrupt excitation-contraction coupling in the affected region of the muscle fiber and likely cause a local flaccid paralysis, which could promote further plasmalemmal/sarcomere dislocation and further T-tubule rupture, thus propagating the muscle damage.
null:133	Finally, we will conclude that if dysferlin is not the protein that helps to prevent such T-tubule damage or helps to heal it, discovering whatever protein does do this job will become just as important for understanding all the muscular dystrophies as is understanding the role of dysferlin itself.

null:138	However, there are problems with this simple interpretation.
null:139	We have studied these reflections at high resolution on the BioCAT beam line at the Argonne National Laboratory, in both relaxed and contracting muscles, and during the onset of activation.
null:140	In resting muscle, two main peaks can generally be seen in the relevant region, and usually at ∼419 and ∼442 Å as previously described, but the latter peak is approximately four times more intense than the former, which would require an underlying sampled peak at ∼437 Å.
null:141	It seems very unlikely that the C protein repeat is different from that of the myosin filament to which it is attached (429.6
null:142	Å), although Squire et al. (Squire, J.M., P.K.

null:145	2003. J. Mol. Biol. 331:713–724) have suggested that C protein may interact in relaxed muscle with specific sites on actin to produce such an effect.
null:146	We think another explanation is more probable, namely a double-interference effect.
null:147	The second component would be a “forbidden” first-order myosin reflection, as discussed by Malinchik and Lednev (Malinchik, S.B., and V.V.

null:152	The interference fringes generated by this system would interact in a complex way with those from C protein because the reflections would in general have different phases.
null:153	We find that the observed pattern, with the very strong ∼442-Å reflection, can be modeled very satisfactorily, even when both underlying peaks are kept at 429.6 Å.

The earliest movements (17–22 hpf) in zebrafish embryos are characterized by spontaneous muscle contractions driven via acetylcholine-generated Ca 2+ signals.
null:157	Mutant lines lacking key components of the excitation–contraction (E-C) pathway, the acetylcholine receptor, and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) show disrupted skeletal muscle development, specifically shorter sarcomeres and longer, misaligned myofibrils (Brennan, C., M. Mangoli, C.E.F.
null:158	Dyer, and R. Ashworth.
null:159	2005. J.
null:160	Cell Sci. 118:5181–5190).
null:161	Based on evidence from these mutants, we propose that myofibril organization is controlled downstream of membrane depolarization.
null:162	The underlying intracellular signaling mechanisms are currently still unknown.
null:163	Ca 2+-mediated muscle contraction or Ca 2+ signals acting independently of contraction could be involved in myofibril organization downstream of membrane depolarization.
null:164	To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we used a pharmacological approach using the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin to block muscle contraction.
null:165	Movement was blocked for a period of 7 hours starting at 17 hpf, and skeletal muscle morphology was subsequently examined using immunocytochemistry.
null:166	Slow muscle fibers of blebbistatin-treated embryos (10, 50 μM) displayed misaligned myofibrils similar to the mutants lacking E-C coupling, suggesting that muscle contraction is a critical regulatory step.
null:167	However, as blebbistatin inhibits both muscle and nonmuscle myosin II, it might affect not only muscle fiber but also neuronal development.
null:168	Axon outgrowth was similar in control and blebbistatin-treated embryos, but an apparent increase in neurite number and the loss of varicosities were observed.
null:169	Disruption to the neuronal pathfinding might affect E-C coupling upstream of contraction and be the underlying cause of the myofiber phenotype.
null:170	Assessment of functional neuromuscular communication by measurement of Ca 2+ signals in muscle fibers revealed that E-C coupling remained intact.
null:171	Collectively, our data suggest that a functional contractile apparatus is required for myofibril organization.
null:172	The late steps of muscle differentiation that rely upon embryonic movement may be regulated by a novel contractile-dependent mechanism.

Emerging evidence indicates that beyond their role as molecular motors, sarcomeric proteins are important in efficient coordination of electrical, mechanical, and chemical signals and the matching of energy demand to energy supply.
null:175	Sarcomeric proteins sense mechanical, chemical, and redox state and serve as sites of signal reception from G protein–coupled receptors and intracellular G protein–controlled processes.
null:176	In turn, sarcomeric proteins—especially at the Z-disk—participate in signal transduction by acting as docking and shuttle sites for kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors.
null:177	Signaling and signal transduction at the level of sarcomeres control cardiac dynamics, growth, and remodeling.
null:178	Mechano-electrical feedback is also now understood to involve Ca 2+ ions buffered by sarcomeric proteins.
null:179	Recent evidence also demonstrates linkages among elements in control of metabolic activity and sarcomeric function.
null:180	For example, kinases such as PKD and AMP kinase not only regulate metabolic pathways, but also affect sarcomeric response to Ca 2+.
null:181	The challenge is to fully integrate these signaling processes at the level of sarcomeric proteins with signaling at the level of channels, transporters, and exchangers, as well as elements controlling redox state and metabolism.
null:182	Disturbances in the role of sarcomeric proteins in integration of these processes represent a significant threat to homeostasis.
null:183	There are no better examples of this threat than familial cardiomyopathies genetically linked to mutations in sarcomeric proteins.
null:184	It is highly likely that these disturbances are also significant in acquired cardiac disorders.
null:185	There are promising data indicating that sarcomeric proteins are useful as therapeutic targets in the treatment of cardiac disorders.
null:186	These findings demand more complete understanding of the processes in sarcomeric signaling from the molecular, cellular, organ, and whole body levels.

In skeletal muscle, intermolecular communication between the L-type Ca 2+ channel (1,4-dihydropyridine receptor [DHPR]) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is bidirectional; orthograde coupling is observed as depolarization-induced Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and retrograde coupling is manifested by increased L-type Ca 2+ current.
null:190	The pharmacogenetic disorder malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is triggered by exposure to heat, volatile anaesthetics, or depolarizing muscle relaxants, has been linked to >120 mutations in RyR1.
null:191	In this study, we investigated whether DHPR activity is affected by one of these MH-linked mutations in RyR1 (R163C).
null:192	To this effect, the I-V relationship for L-type currents in myotubes originating from R163C mice was shifted to more hyperpolarizing potentials (∼5 and 7 mV for HET and HOM, respectively) compared with wild-type myotubes (P < 0.001; ANOVA ).
null:193	Compared with wild-type myotubes, R163C HET and HOM myotubes both displayed a greater sensitivity to the 1,4-dihydropyiridine agonist ±Bay K 8644 (10 μM).
null:194	Intramembrane charge movements of both HET and HOM myotubes were profoundly shifted (>10 mV) to more hyperpolarized potentials (P < 0.005; ANOVA ).
null:195	L-type currents in wild-type and HET myotubes displayed only modest (<35%) inactivation after 30-s prepulses to −50, −30, and −10 mV, with no apparent difference between the two genotypes.
null:196	Our results demonstrate that the RyR1 R163C mutation alters the voltage dependence of L-type channel activity and suggest that this hypersensitivity to membrane potential contributes to increased myoplasmic Ca 2+ levels associated with MH episodes.

Most of the calcium that activates contraction in the ventricle comes from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and is released by the process of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR).
null:200	I will initially consider the mechanisms involved in regulating SR Ca content.
null:201	We find a simple feedback mechanism in which an increase of SR Ca results in a larger systolic Ca transient that, in turn, increases Ca efflux from the cell, thereby decreasing SR Ca content.
null:202	One consequence of this feedback is that maneuvers that increase the open probability of the RyR do not produce a maintained increase of systolic Ca.
null:203	If SR Ca content is increased above a threshold value, propagating waves of CICR are observed.
null:204	These waves produce arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) by activating the electrogenic NCX.
null:205	This may also occur when SR Ca content is not elevated.
null:206	One example is in the presence of mutations of the RyR that can cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).
null:207	Here, ventricular arrhythmias occur when catecholamine levels are increased during exercise and other stresses.
null:208	This arises because the mutated RyRs leak Ca during diastole.
null:209	We have examined whether increasing the RyR leak per se produces diastolic Ca waves.
null:210	When low concentrations of caffeine are applied to increase RyR opening, Ca waves are only seen for a few seconds.
null:211	The disappearance of the Ca waves is due to the accompanying decrease of SR Ca content.
null:212	If, however, a β-adrenergic agonist is first applied, caffeine produces waves in the steady state and we attribute this to the increase of SR Ca content due to the β agonist.
null:213	This explains why the patients with mutated RyRs develop arrhythmias during exercise.
null:214	The final part of the talk will consider how Ca wave-dependent arrhythmias might be treated.
null:215	We find that decreasing the open probability of the RyR with tetracaine abolishes the Ca wave and increases the systolic Ca release.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) remains a significant cause of postoperative complications after renal transplant surgery and is the second most common infection seen in general practice.
null:218	UTI, therefore, remains a constant and important clinical as well as economic problem.
null:219	Ascending UTIs cause abnormal ureteric function, but little is known about the mechanisms causing this effect.
null:220	Our preliminary studies have shown that prolonged intraluminal exposure of rat ureter to UPEC caused changes in ureteric smooth muscle contractility; however, the underlying mechanisms causing this effect were unclear.
null:221	In the present study, changes in phasic contractions and Ca 2+ transients evoked by electrical field stimulation of Indo-1–loaded rat ureters during exposure to UPEC were investigated.
null:222	Exposure of ureters to pathogenic UPEC J96 on the luminal but not adventitial side of the ureter caused a time-dependent decrease in amplitude and duration of the Ca 2+ transient and phasic contractions.
null:223	Nonpathogenic TG2 under identical conditions had little or no effect.
null:224	Inhibition of K + channels by TEA (5 mM) significantly but not completely reversed the inhibitory effects of J96 on Ca 2+ transients and force.
null:225	J96 also decreased Ca 2+ transients and force induced by sustained high-K + depolarization.
null:226	Our data indicate that a decrease in the amplitude of the phasic contractions induced by prolonged exposure to J96 in rat ureter smooth muscle is associated with a decrease in the amplitude and duration of the Ca 2+ transient.
null:227	The data suggest that this modulation of the Ca 2+ transient and force in rat ureter smooth muscle induced by intraluminal J96 exposure is likely associated with an up-regulation of the activity of potassium channels and down-regulation of the activity of L-type calcium channels.

The junctional domain of sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) is specialized for receiving signals from the plasmalemma/transverse tubules and for releasing Ca 2+ during muscle activation.
null:230	The junctional face of the jSR, facing the T tubules, is occupied by a molecular complex composed of the transmembrane Ca 2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors [RyRs]), the luminal protein calsequestrin (CSQ), the two membrane proteins, junctin and triadin (Jct, Tr), which mediate CSQ-RyR interactions, and several other components.
null:231	Under the conditions prevailing within the SR lumen (physiological ionic strength, mostly due to K + Ca 2+ ions), CSQ forms long linear polymers, and the fixed protein gel is clearly visible in the electron microscope.
null:232	The luminal domains of Jct and Tr are detectable, but overall the two molecules are not clearly delineated.
null:233	Overexpression and/or null mutation for the three proteins of the junctional complex (CSQ, Jct, and Tr) in skeletal and cardiac muscles reveal the contribution of these three components to the general architecture and maintenance of the jSR.

Activation of ionotropic P2X purinoreceptors (P2XRs) elevates [Ca 2+] i in renal vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMCs) triggering their contraction, thus, leading to renal vasoconstriction (Inscho, E.W. 2001.

null:238	280:F927–F944).
null:239	By combining perforated patch tight-seal recording with confocal Ca 2+ imaging (with fluo-4), we related the dynamics of [Ca 2+] i mobilization to the kinetics of P2XR-mediated cationic current (I P2X) or changes in the membrane potential of RVSMCs freshly isolated from interlobar and arcuate arteries of rat kidney and stimulated with 10 μM α,β-methyleneadenosine triphosphate (AMP-CPP).
null:240	Under current clamp, spike-like depolarization was associated with transient [Ca 2+] i mobilization.
null:241	Under voltage clamp, the [Ca 2+] i transient was associated with I P2X activation: the current density was 141.5 ± 10.5 pA/pF ( n = 38) at V h = −60 mV.
null:242	Both spike-like depolarization and I P2X peaked before [Ca 2+] i reached its maximum, suggesting that I P2X is a major determinant of the spike-like depolarization, and that there are other than I P2X contributors to the [Ca 2+] i transient.
null:243	RT-PCR analysis conducted on 500 isolated RVSMCs showed the presence of genes encoding P2X 1R and P2X 4R.
null:244	Concentration dependence of I P2X activation with AMP-CPP revealed EC 50 = 1.1 ± 0.1 μM ( n = 6–7).
null:245	I P2X induced by 10 μM AMP-CPP completely recovered from desensitization within 7 min.
null:246	An increase in extracellular Ca 2+ from 1 to 5 mM reduced I P2X by 48 ± 6% ( n = 5).
null:247	Nanomolar concentrations of NF279 (selective inhibitor of P2X 1R) reduced I P2X by 68 ± 3% in a concentration-dependent manner (EC 50 = 8 ± 3 nM; n = 5–6).
null:248	The residual current was virtually insensitive to intermediate concentrations (0.2–20 μM) of NF279, but was inhibited with 2 mM NF279.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are extremely important for triggering muscle contraction and physically linked with L-type Ca 2+ channels, providing an amplification of the Ca 2+ signal necessary to trigger muscle contraction.
null:253	However, this coupling between L-type Ca 2+ channels and RyRs has not been well characterized in the CNS.
null:254	In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening system with the N terminus of rat Ca v1.3 α 1 subunit (Ca v1.3-NT) as bait and isolated a partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of RyR type 2 (RyR2-NT) as a binding partner.
null:255	We also demonstrated a physical association of Ca v1.3 with RyR2 using GST pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry assays.
null:256	Depolarizing cells showed that the activation of L-type Ca 2+ channels induced RyR opening and led to RyR-dependent Ca 2+ release, even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+.
null:257	Furthermore, we found that RyR2 mRNA itself is increased by long-term treatment of high-K via activation of L-type Ca 2+ channels.
null:258	These acute and long-term effects of high-K on RyRs were selectively blocked by small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Ca v1.3.

null:306	However, this new electro-mechanical model initially was not adequate.
null:307	Particularly, the model revealed Ca 2+ overload of the cell when pacing at 1, 0.5, and 0.3 Hz.
null:308	Moreover, the ratio between amounts of Ca 2+ released from the SR and entering the cell via L-type channels was not realistic and did not allow us to simulate contractions properly.
null:309	Both inadequacies happened due to the equations for Ca 2+ exchange between the SR and cytosol adopted from the Pandit's model.

Contraction of resistance arteries in response to increased transmural pressure (the myogenic response) is a crucial determinant of peripheral vascular resistance, blood pressure, and regional blood flow control in several vascular beds, including the cerebral vasculature.
null:315	Understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the myogenic response, however, is incomplete.
null:316	Myogenic constriction is dependent in part on pressure-induced membrane potential depolarization, but mechanisms in addition to changes in membrane potential and cytosolic free Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] i) have been implicated.
null:317	For example, Ca 2+ sensitization, i.e., an increase in force without a change in [Ca 2+] i, has been suggested to contribute to the myogenic response, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.
null:318	We investigated the potential involvement of Rho-associated kinase (ROK)- and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chain phosphatase-targeting subunit (MYPT1) and of the 17-kD PKC-potentiated protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor protein (CPI-17), respectively, in the myogenic response of rat middle cerebral arteries.
null:319	Inhibitors of ROK (Y27632 and H1152) and PKC (GF109203X and Gö6976) suppressed the myogenic response.
null:320	Elevated pressure (60 and 100 mmHg vs. 10 mmHg) increased phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T855, but not T697, and enhanced myosin regulatory light chain (LC 20) phosphorylation in an H1152-sensitive manner.
null:321	However, pressure did not evoke CPI-17 phosphorylation, and inhibition of PKC did not affect the pressure-induced increases in MYPT1 (T855) or LC 20 phosphorylation.
null:322	Our findings provide the first direct biochemical evidence that Ca 2+ sensitization induced by ROK-dependent phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T855 (but not T697), with subsequent augmentation of LC 20 phosphorylation and force generation, contributes to the myogenic response in the cerebral vasculature.
null:323	On the other hand, suppression of the myogenic response by PKC inhibition cannot be attributed to block of Ca 2+ sensitization mediated by CPI-17 or MYPT1 phosphorylation.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe muscle wasting disease caused by the absence of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin.
null:331	Experiments on the mdx mouse, which also lacks dystrophin, have shown that mdx muscles are particularly susceptible to stretch-induced damage.
null:332	We have shown that Ca 2+ entry through a channel blocked by streptomycin, Gd 3+, or the spider venom peptide, GsMTx-4, contributes to stretch-induced muscle damage (Yeung, E.W., N.P.

null:338	The pharmacological and functional properties of this Ca 2+ entry channel resemble a stretch-activated channel permeable to many cations known as SAC NSC, which is expressed in muscle and for which a candidate gene is TRPC1 (Maroto, R., A.

null:347	We have also shown that Ca 2+ entry into mdx muscle fibers can also be stimulated by H 2O 2 and entry is also blocked by streptomycin, suggesting that the physiological activator of SAC NSC may be reactive oxygen species (ROS).
null:348	To gain further understanding of the properties of TRPC1, it was expressed in C2 myoblasts.
null:349	When expressed alone, it did not appear in the surface membrane, but when coexpressed with caveolin-3, the proteins co-located in the membrane (Gervásio, O.L., N.P.

null:356	When TRPC1 was located in the membrane, it could be activated by H 2O 2, causing Ca 2+ influx that was blocked by PP2, an inhibitor of src kinase.
null:357	These data suggest that in muscular dystrophy, excessive production of ROS might open SAC NSC channels by activating src kinase.
null:358	These pathways offer several new targets for therapy of muscular dystrophy.

The molecular rearrangement of rhodopsin upon photoisomerization is accompanied by a net charge displacement with a vectorial component normal to the membrane plane.
null:361	As a result, a rapid early receptor current (ERC) is produced, which is easily detectable by voltage clamp recording when the photopigment is embedded in the plasmalemma.
null:362	This signal allows, among others, separating the triggering events of the visual process from those arising from the subsequent activation of the enzymatic transduction pathway.
null:363	We examined the ERC in the ciliary photoreceptors of the distal retina of Pecten in which the photopigment is thermally stable, and transitions between rhodopsin (R) and metarhodopsin (M) states are accompanied by a marked shift in spectral absorbance; as such, reversible manipulations of the pigment-state distribution can be induced by chromatic illumination.
null:364	Delivery of brief, intense flashes under voltage clamp induced displacement currents that could be isolated by kinetics, by pharmacological blockage of the photoconductance, or by elimination of the driving force on K ions that comprise the photocurrent.
null:365	The polarity and amplitude of the displacement currents could be controlled by prior chromatic adaptation in which the wavelength of the adapting light was varied, while using fixed, spectrally neutral test stimuli.
null:366	In particular, limiting initial distributions yielded ERCs of opposite directions (concomitant with M→R and R→M transitions, respectively), but conserved total charge.
null:367	The occurrence of a charge displacement necessarily implies that the conformational transition rates of the receptor molecule must interact with the membrane field.
null:368	We recorded ERCs in both directions, while systematically varying the holding potential of the cell by voltage clamp.
null:369	A distinct, orderly dependency of the peak amplitude of the displacement current on membrane potential was obtained; this relation is analyzed in terms of energetics of rhodopsin conformational rearrangement and the equivalent charge implicated.

Electrochemical detection of oxidizable compounds via microscopic fibers has been a valuable approach for examining secretion mechanisms, and, in its most ambitious applications, has allowed monitoring release at the single-cell level.
null:373	Inevitably, owing to the minute amounts of the target substance, concentration changes in the vicinity of an individual, isolated cell are exceedingly small, and the sensitivity limit of the detecting instrument is a severe limiting factor.
null:374	This issue is particularly challenging for non-vesicular secretion, a non-canonical mechanism of significant interest: unlike exocytosis (where the molecules are released in batches of thousands), in this case extrusion occurs at a much slower rate, and the resulting extracellular concentration changes are even smaller, yielding a grossly inadequate signal-to-noise ratio.
null:375	Phase-locked detection can bring out a small signal buried in a much larger noise, provided that the signal in question can be modulated with an established periodicity, which effectively accomplishes two goals: (1) displace the signal away from the DC end of the spectrum, where 1/f noise is dominant; (2) enable extraction of the signal by ultra-narrow bandwidth filtering.
null:376	We developed a method in which the electrical potential of a carbon fiber is modulated sinusoidally, and a dual phase/lock loop amplifier is used to extract the oxidation current from contaminating dielectric signals of the same frequency that arise from the electrical double-layer at the electrode–solution interface.
null:377	The bandwidth of this approach is limited by the integration interval and thus by the driving frequency used.
null:378	Initial measurements reveal that the detection limit attained exceeds that of conventional amperometric measurements with constant electrode polarization, while the temporal resolution is in the range of 10 −1 s.
null:379	This approach can thus be useful for point measurements of changes in concentration of oxidizable substances released with flux magnitudes and time course like those expected in transporter-mediated extrusion.

Rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) is a widely accepted ground-based model of skeletal muscle adaptation to microgravity or bed rest–induced disuse.
null:385	After HU, soleus muscle, a slow-twitch muscle functionally devoted to postural maintenance, experience atrophy and slow-to-fast phenotype transition.
null:386	In parallel, resting sarcolemma chloride conductance (gCl), which controls muscle excitability, and cytosolic calcium at rest (restCa) are modified by HU condition.
null:387	Indeed, restCa, measured by FURA-2, decreased and gCl, measured by 2-intracellular-microelectrode current clamp technique, increased after 3-day HU toward values typical of fast-twitch muscle, before initiation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) transition.
null:388	The gCl increase resulted from the reduction of protein kinase C activity (Pierno, S., J.F.

null:408	A taurine-enriched diet significantly prevented changes in gCl, restCa, and MHC expression, but not atrophy in HU rat soleus muscles.
null:409	Recent data suggest a link between oxidative stress and muscle atrophy.
null:410	Thus, we evaluate the effects of the treatment with the potent antioxidant trolox in HU mice.
null:411	This compound fully prevented lipoperoxidation, measured by fluorimetric technique and gCl increase.
null:412	However, trolox partially counteracted MHC isoform transition, but had no effect on atrophy.
null:413	The hormone ghrelin can improve lean body mass in catabolic states and reduces gCl in fast-twitch muscles through PKC activation.
null:414	Preliminary experiments suggest that ghrelin improves the modification of gCl in soleus muscle of 3–14-day HU mice.

Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a maladaptive response of the myocardium to persistent cardiovascular stress.
null:419	The cellular features observed during hypertrophy can be recapitulated on stimulation of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) with the paracrine modulator endothelin-1 (ET-1).
null:420	Multiple signaling pathways are activated by ET-1 stimulation, including MAPK cascades and IP 3-dependent calcium release.
null:421	Application of ET-1 (100 nM) to NRVM for 24 hours increased expression of the hypertrophic marker atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) at both the mRNA and protein level.
null:422	The MEK1 inhibitor PD184352 (1 μM) inhibited the response to ET-1.
null:423	This effect was observed both in the presence and absence of voltage-gated calcium cycling.
null:424	ET-1 also increased mRNA levels of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator of the ERK1/2 cascade.
null:425	Overexpression of DUSP6 by adenoviral infection inhibited both basal and agonist-induced ANF expression.
null:426	The mechanism underlying ERK1/2-dependent gene expression was investigated by monitoring the activity of an AP-1–dependent luciferase reporter construct.
null:427	Application of ET-1 increased AP-1 luciferase activity in a PD184352-sensitive manner.
null:428	To further characterize the significance of ERK1/2 signaling, workload-induced hypertrophy was modeled by enhancing global calcium signals with BayK 8644, an L-type calcium channel agonist.
null:429	Inhibition of ERK1/2 prevented BayK 8644–induced hypertrophy.
null:430	Intriguingly, BayK 8644 did not induce AP-1–dependent transcriptional activity.
null:431	In summary, these results indicate that ERK1/2 activity is necessary for gene expression induced by multiple hypertrophic agonists.
null:432	In the absence of global calcium signals, sensitivity to ERK1/2 inhibition persists.
null:433	This suggests that ERK1/2 activity is necessary for the induction of hypertrophy-associated gene expression under conditions that solely elicit IP 3-dependent calcium release, which is itself necessary for the hypertrophic response.
null:434	Although both ET-1 and BayK 8644 induce an ERK1/2-dependent hypertrophic pattern of gene expression, only ET-1 elicits AP-1 transcriptional activity.
null:435	This implies that additional transcriptional regulators must be involved in the hypertrophic response.

Functional hyperemia, a vasodilatory response to increased neuronal activity, ensures an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen to active brain regions.
null:439	Increased intracerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activity is a fundamental physiological process that is exploited diagnostically, forming the basis for techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which uses both perfusion and blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) contrast to map brain function.
null:440	Recent evidence indicates that neuronal activity is encoded in astrocytes in the form of dynamic intracellular calcium (Ca 2+) signals, which travel to astrocytic processes (“endfeet”) encasing the arterioles in the brain.
null:441	Astrocytic Ca 2+ signaling has been implicated in the dilatory response of adjacent arterioles, in keeping with the functional linkage between neuronal activity and enhanced local blood flow.
null:442	Paradoxically, however, astrocytic Ca 2+ signals have also been linked to constriction.
null:443	Here, we show that regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca 2+ was elevated, modest increases in Ca 2+ induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction.
null:444	Large-conductance, Ca 2+-sensitive potassium (BK) channels in astrocytic endfeet mediate a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K + as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction.
null:445	K + efflux through astrocytic endfoot BK channels could lead to a rapid dilation or constriction of adjacent arterioles, depending on its local perivascular concentration.
null:446	Elevation of external K + to 20 mM or less activates smooth muscle (SM) inward rectifier potassium channels, causing SM hyperpolarization, closing of SM voltage-dependent calcium channels, a decrease in SM calcium, and thereby vasodilation.
null:447	Elevation of external K + above 20 mM causes SM depolarization and vasoconstriction.
null:448	These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on extracellular K + and astrocytic endfoot Ca 2+.

It is now generally believed that anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) have both genomic and nongenomic actions (Lösel, R.M., E. Falkenstein, M. Feuring, A.

null:458	Physiol.
null:459	Rev.
null:460	83:965–1016).
null:461	The genomic actions of AAS take several hours to days to be manifested and are mediated through the androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor family (Heinlein, C.A., and C.
null:462	Chang.
null:463	2002.
null:464	Mol.
null:465	Endocrinol.
null:466	16:2181–2187).
null:467	In contrast, the rapid actions of AAS are evident within minutes and may be effected through second messenger signaling mechanisms initiated by the attachment of these hormones to a G protein–coupled receptor on the cell surface (Estrada, M., A.

null:472	However, the receptor involved remains uncertain.
null:473	Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the identity of this receptor.
null:474	The experiments were performed using small muscle fiber bundles isolated from either the extensor digitorum longus (a fast-twitch muscle) or soleus (a slow-twitch muscle) of adult female CD-1 mice aged 49 ± 5 days.
null:475	The fiber bundles were treated with DHT, DHT plus various inhibitors, or the vehicle only.
null:476	During an experiment, maximum isometric tension (P o) was measured and the fiber bundles were processed for immunoblotting.
null:477	Our results show that treating the fiber bundles with DHT increased Po in fast-twitch fibers but decreased it in the slow-twitch fibers.
null:478	It also led to a two- to threefold increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–activated kinases 1/2 and the 20-kD regulatory myosin light chains in both fiber types.
null:479	Moreover, all these effects could be reversibly blocked by AG1478 but not by flutamide and cyproterone acetate.
null:480	From these results, we suggest that DHT exerts its rapid actions, in intact mammalian skeletal muscle fibers, through the EGFR.

null:498	Our analysis revealed that Igfn1 is a complex locus conserved in all available mammalian genomes.
null:499	Encoded here are IGFN1, a large skeletal muscle-specific protein, and other smaller isoforms showing a wider expression profile.
null:500	IGFN1 contains two segments spanning three and eight globular domains located at the N and C termini of the protein, respectively, and separated by a large unstructured region lacking any recognizable domain.
null:501	Y2H, biochemical, and immunofluorescence experiments have provided evidence that IGFN1, KY, and FLNC are members of a protein complex that localize to the sarcomeric Z-band.
null:502	However, in adult skeletal muscle IGFN1 behaves as a Z-band–associated protein that is also present in the nucleus.
null:503	Here, we show that the three N-terminal globular domains of IGFN1 are sufficient to provide both nuclear localization and Z-band targeting in transduced cardiomyocytes and transgenic lines.
null:504	Consistent with those observations, IGFN1 immunohistochemistry of adult muscle shows clear Z-band staining as well as nuclear staining in a proportion of myonuclei.
null:505	However, atrophic muscles in the ky/ky mouse mutant, such as soleus, do not show IGFN1 staining in the nucleus.
null:506	We hypothesize that the Z-band KY protein complex could be involved in mediating a response to changes in tension or overload, and that IGFN1 could act as a link to the nucleus to influence transcriptional changes.

To better understand the pathological mechanism of a human dilated cardiomyopathy phospholamban (PLB) mutation (R9C), we investigated the effects of this mutation on PLB structure and regulatory interactions.
null:511	Notably, we observed efficient phosphorylation of R9C-PLB by PKA in vitro, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed no change in R9C-PLB structure compared with WT.
null:512	However, R9C-PLB reconstituted into lipid vesicles showed increased sensitivity to oxidizing conditions, responding to peroxide challenge with a decreased electrophoretic mobility suggestive of increased oligomerization.
null:513	This oligomeric species was characterized by a high thermal stability compared with WT pentamers.
null:514	To test R9C-PLB binding interactions in live cells, PLB was expressed as cyan and yellow fluorescent protein (CFP/YFP) fusions in AAV-293 cells, and PLB oligomerization and SERCA binding were quantified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).
null:515	100 μM H 2O 2 applied to the cells induced a rapid quench of CFP-R9C-PLB fluorescence and a concomitant increase in YFP-R9C-PLB fluorescence, indicating an increase in intraoligomeric FRET after oxidation.
null:516	FRET enhancement after peroxide addition was not observed for CFP/YFP-WT-PLB.
null:517	To test whether the FRET increase was due to increased oligomerization or a quaternary conformation change, we measured intraoligomeric FRET in a population of cells expressing a wide range of R9C-PLB protein concentrations.
null:518	FRET dependence on concentration yielded oligomer-intrinsic FRET efficiency (FRET max) and relative dissociation constant (K D).
null:519	Compared with WT, R9C-PLB had a decreased K D and increased FRET max, indicating an increased oligomerization affinity and more compact oligomer structure, respectively.
null:520	The enhanced oligomerization of R9C-PLB was matched by a decrease in SERCA binding compared with WT.
null:521	Overall, the data suggest a new mechanism by which the R9C mutation may exert a pathological effect: decreased SERCA regulation and increased oligomerization, as consequences of increased oxidation sensitivity of R9C-PLB.

Phospholamban is expressed at high levels in the heart, where it is the major regulator of the calcium pump SERCA2a.
null:524	However, it is also present at lower levels in skeletal muscle, where both SERCA1a and SERCA2a variants are present.
null:525	These SERCA isoforms have been used interchangeably in mutagenic and structural analyses of the PLB-SERCA interaction, since in vitro studies have shown their functional inhibition by PLB is equivalent.
null:526	To quantify the quaternary structure and binding energetics of PLB binding to SERCA isoforms, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from CFP-SERCA1a or CFP-SERCA2a to YFP-PLB was measured in live AAV-293 cells.
null:527	FRET efficiency increased with increasing protein expression level to a maximum of 28.8% for PLB-SERCA1a and 28.1% for PLB-SERCA2a, suggesting that the complexes have the same quaternary conformation.
null:528	Unexpectedly, the data also revealed that PLB has a 2.6-fold higher apparent affinity for SERCA1a relative to SERCA2a.
null:529	To test whether the observed difference in affinity arises from differential distributions of SERCA E1/E2 enzymatic substates, cells were treated with 1 mM EGTA and 0.5 uL/ml calcium ionophore A23187.
null:530	Under these conditions, PLB still showed greater affinity for SERCA1a over SERCA2a, suggesting that the differential affinities are intrinsic properties of the SERCA isoforms.
null:531	The data suggest that PLB preferentially binds SERCA1a over SERCA2a, a selectivity that may be functionally significant in skeletal muscle.

Muscle protein degradation is associated with a variety of human diseases and is thought to be regulated by at least a dozen extra-muscular signals.
null:535	We have spent several years developing C. elegans a genomic model organism, into a model for studying the intramuscular signals that regulate cytosolic muscle protein degradation.
null:536	As of April 1, 2009, we have examined 324 genes (of roughly 20,000 total or 3,000 muscle enriched) by mutation and/or RNAi and have found 64 genes that regulate muscle protein synthesis and/or degradation.
null:537	We have discovered that: (1) proteasome-mediated degradation is negatively regulated by genes that regulate depolarization of the plasma membrane and intra-muscular calcium release; (2) autophagy-mediated degradation is combinatorially regulated by negative signal from insulin and TGF-β receptors and positive signal from a constitutive, autocrine FGF signal; (3) apparent calpain-mediated degradation is negatively regulated by a variety of integrin-linked molecules at the costamere; (4) as many as 20% of kinases (100 of 450 have been tested) and 30% of genes that regulate muscle contraction (105 of ∼2,000 have been tested) may act to regulate cytosolic muscle protein degradation.
null:538	In so far as they have yet been examined, identical signals appear to function in mammalian muscle.
null:539	Although the regulatory network controlling muscle protein degradation in human beings likely involves additional components, connections, and thus complexity, C. elegans appears to be a good model for understanding the evolutionarily conserved elements that regulate muscle protein degradation.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) regulate vessel diameter and determine tissue perfusion.
null:545	However, they also contribute significantly to occlusive vascular diseases by virtue of its ability to switch to an activated, noncontractile, migratory, and proliferating phenotype.
null:546	Although the participation of ion channels in this phenotypic switch has been previously described, the changes in their expression are poorly defined mainly due to their large molecular diversity.
null:547	Here, we used high-throughput real-time PCR to obtain a global portrait of ion channel expression in contractile VSMCs from mouse femoral arteries, exploring changes upon phenotypic switch in two experimental paradigms: an in vivo model of endoluminal lesion–induced neointimal hyperplasia and an in vitro model in which cultured VSMCs were obtained from explants.
null:548	The channel genes studied included K + channels (α, β, and γ subunits) and α subunits of voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels (VDCC), Cl −, and TRP channels.
null:549	The analysis of changes in mRNA expression of these channels showed a good correlation between the two proliferative models, with 16 genes displaying significant variation in both conditions.
null:550	Among those, only two genes, Kv1.3 and Kvβ2, increased their expression in proliferative VSMCs.
null:551	By combining immunological and electrophysiological techniques, we explore the expression and the functional contribution of these proteins in contractile and proliferating VSMCs.
null:552	Our data show that Kv1.3 currents become the predominant outward K + current in cultured VSMCs.
null:553	Moreover, we found that the up-regulation of Kv1.3 currents in these cells is an essential component of the phenotypic switch, as the specific blockade of Kv1.3 channels inhibits VSMCs migration and proliferation.
null:554	Collectively, our results pinpoint Kv1.3 channels as new therapeutical targets for the treatment of vascular disorders involving VSMC proliferation.

Ostes is a novel N -ethyl N -nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mouse mutant with muscle atrophy.
null:558	Ostes mice suffer chronic neuromuscular impairments, including neuromuscular junction degeneration, polyneuronal innervation, and myopathy.
null:559	Analysis of 23 other tissues, including heart, did not reveal any other pathological change.
null:560	Genetic mapping identified a small region on distal chromosome 8 segregating with the ostes phenotype.
null:561	Sequence analysis of that chromosomal segment revealed no coding or splicing mutation in any of the annotated genes.
null:562	However, expression studies indicated accumulation of the protein PKD1L2 in skeletal muscle from ostes/ostes mice.
null:563	Because the mutation provoking up-regulation of the linked gene Pkd1l2 has not yet been identified, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of this gene is causative by generating a transgenic line with a BAC clone spanning Pkd1l2 and one flanking gene on each side.
null:564	The flanking genes, Gcsh and Bcmo1 were ruled out as candidates for this disease, as their expression was normal in ostes/ostes mice and their exons and cDNAs contained no mutation.
null:565	Transgenic mice Tg(Pkd1l2)/Tg(Pkd1l2) reproduced the ostes myopathic changes, including fiber size asymmetry, small but significant reduction of the cross-sectional area of type II fibers, regeneration, and lack of macrophage infiltration.
null:566	Muscle atrophy in Tg(Pkd1l2)/Tg(Pkd1l2) mice was more severe than in ostes/ostes mice.
null:567	Moreover, double heterozygous mice ( ostes /+, Tg(Pkd1l2) /0) suffer myopathic changes more profound than each heterozygote, indicating positive correlation between PKD1L2 levels and disease severity.
null:568	We show that, in vivo, PKD1L2 primarily associates with endogenous fatty acid synthase (FASN) in normal skeletal muscle, and these proteins appear to colocalize to costameric regions of the muscle fiber.
null:569	In diseased ostes/ostes muscle, both proteins are up-regulated and ostes/ostes mice show signs of abnormal lipid metabolism.
null:570	In conclusion, our data suggest that PKD1L2 up-regulation is a cause of neuromuscular defects in mice.

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can be caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins.
null:574	Studies of DCM mutations in TnT, TnC, and tropomyosin in recombinant protein in vitro indicated a common molecular phenotype with reduced Ca 2+ sensitivity and cross-bridge cycling rate.
null:575	However, investigations in more organized systems contradict this mechanism, putting its physiological relevance in doubt.
null:576	We investigated native thin filament Ca 2+-regulatory properties using actin from a transgenic mouse expressing the E361G DCM-causing mutation combined with human cardiac troponin and tropomyosin.
null:577	In in vitro motility assays (IVMAs) we could observe no differences between E361G and NTG mouse thin filaments; however, when troponin was dephosphorylated with acid phosphatase, we observed that E361 Ca 2+ sensitivity was lower than NTG, as previously found with the recombinant proteins (ratio of EC 50 1:2.6).
null:578	When we compared natively phosphorylated and dephosphorylated thin filaments, we observed that Ca 2+ sensitivity did not change in E361G mouse thin filaments, but the Ca 2+ sensitivity increased 3.1 times on dephosphorylation of NTG mouse as expected.
null:579	Thus, the only functional change induced by the E361G mutation in cardiac actin was a blunted response to troponin I phosphorylation.
null:580	This would be predicted to compromise the lusitropic response to catecholamines.
null:581	In addition, we studied troponin extracted from the explanted heart of a DCM patient carrying the cardiac TnC G159D mutation.
null:582	IVMA investigation of reconstituted thin filaments showed that the cTnC G159D mutation also showed little change in Ca 2+ sensitivity when TnI was dephosphorylated (EC 50 P/unP = 1.2 ± 0.2).
null:583	TnC G159D troponin also showed a higher Ca 2+ sensitivity than donor heart troponin, regardless of phosphorylation status.
null:584	We propose that the DCM phenotype is caused by uncoupling of the relationship between phosphorylation and Ca 2+ sensitivity.
null:585	Ca 2+ sensitivity is not correlated with DCM, but the phosphorylation status of troponin I and other posttranslational modifications of sarcomeric proteins are critical determinants of the functional effects of a mutation.

Heritable hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCMs) are the most common cause of unexpected sudden death in the young and are due in most cases to a point mutation in one of several sarcomeric proteins, including β myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C, and regulatory proteins associated with the thin filament.
null:588	HCMs are characterized by accelerated contraction during systole, but cardiac function is paradoxically reduced.
null:589	To study the basis for these phenomena, we have developed a murine model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to disruption of the MYBPC3 gene that encodes cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C), a thick filament accessory protein that is thought to have both structural and regulatory roles in striated muscle contraction.
null:590	This disruption of the gene results in ablation of cMyBP-C, which is similar to the molecular phenotype observed in human patients with HCM due to C-terminal truncations of cMyBP-C in which sarcomeric cMyBP-C content is reduced.
null:591	Hearts from these mice exhibit septal hypertrophy, increased chamber size, and reductions in both stroke volume and the period of ejection.
null:592	Myocardium from these mice exhibit depressed twitch force–frequency relationships, accelerated relaxation kinetics, and a loss of both frequency-dependent and β agonist–induced acceleration of relaxation.
null:593	These results can be explained by an acceleration of cross-bridge interaction kinetics due to the ablation of cMyBP-C, which in turn cause an acceleration of twitch kinetics, a reduction in peak force or pressure, and reduced stroke volume.

15459755:0	Introduction 
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the best-described adult stem cell population at a phenotypic and functional level.
15459755:1	Recent attempts have been made to characterize their molecular regulation by comparing their gene expression profiles with those of other stem cell populations ( ; ; ).
15459755:2	These analyses of normal steady-state stem cells revealed so-called stem cell signatures, but the overlap of genes that universally defined “stemness” was extremely limited.
15459755:3	Here, we have focused on HSCs alone in order to systematically examine one process, that of HSC self renewal, comprising a cycle of quiescence, proliferation, and reinduction of a dormant state.
15459755:4	In a normal adult, HSCs reside in the bone marrow, where they are relatively inactive.
15459755:5	Long-term HSCs divide infrequently to produce more proliferative short-term HSCs, which in turn generate the lineage-committed progenitors that manufacture the billions of differentiated hematopoietic cells that daily enter the peripheral blood.
15459755:6	One hallmark of HSCs is their ability to rapidly proliferate in response to stressors such as myelosuppressive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation in order to quickly generate work-horse progenitors as well as additional stem cells, which then return to quiescence.
15459755:7	While this expansion of HSCs occurs naturally in vivo, there is as yet little understanding of the genes that control this process.
15459755:8	A full appreciation of the molecular regulation of stem cell self renewal could illuminate the development of cancers as well as potentially inform strategies for in vitro stem cell expansion, which would have enormous clinical advantages.
15459755:9	Thus, we sought to understand the molecular mechanisms by which HSCs respond to an activating trigger, initiate a program of cell division, and resume quiescence by suppression of cell division.
15459755:10	Our approach was to examine the transcriptional profiles of purified adult HSCs throughout a time course of induced proliferation, and compare the gene expression in these cells to that of naturally dividing fetal liver HSCs (FL-HSCs).
15459755:11	Normal adult HSCs are largely nondividing, with around 1%–3% in cycle and approximately 90% in G0 ( ; ; ; ).
15459755:12	A single injection of the pyrimidine analog 5-fluorouracil (5FU) kills cycling hematopoietic cells, bringing the spared quiescent HSCs into cycle to repopulate the depleted bone marrow ( ; ; ).
15459755:13	HSC proliferation proceeds in a time-dependent manner, peaking 5 to 6 d after treatment, with approximately 20% of HSCs in cycle, before returning to normal around day 10 ( A and ; ).
15459755:14	Changes in the cell surface profile concomitant with cell cycle activation have been observed.
15459755:15	The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit, normally expressed at high levels in quiescent HSCs, is down-regulated after 5FU treatment.
15459755:16	Conversely, the markers Mac1 and AA4.1, absent on normal HSCs, are expressed at low levels after 5FU treatment ( ; ).
15459755:17	During the latter part of mammalian embryonic development, HSCs reside in the fetal liver, where they undergo a massive expansion prior to entering the bone marrow.
15459755:18	Approximately 30% of murine FL-HSCs are in cycle, and similar to 5FU-activated HSCs (5FU-HSCs), they express AA4.1 and Mac1 ( ; ).
15459755:19	Given the similarities between 5FU-activated HSCs and FL-HSCs, we hypothesized that they would share similar gene expression profiles vis-à-vis proliferation and that simultaneous comparison of FL-HSCs, adult quiescent HSCs, and 5FU-HSCs would define genes specifically involved with HSC proliferation.
15459755:20	Indeed, we defined both proliferation and quiescence signatures for HSCs, validated these groupings using Gene Ontology (GO) classifications, and created a model of the HSC proliferation cycle.
15459755:21	Results 
Discussion 
Here we have identified proliferation and quiescence signatures of HSCs.
15459755:22	Our experimental design utilized a combination of pair-wise comparisons and time course microarray experiments.
15459755:23	The pair-wise analysis allowed us to find the genes different between quiescent and cycling HSCs, while the time course data allowed us to order these genes in a time-dependent manner.
15459755:24	The power of our overall methodology is reflected in the remarkable overlaps between the gene lists presented and those extracted from published data, in particular the common P-sig and common Q-sig.
15459755:25	Applying a novel approach to utilizing the GO annotations, we calculated the statistical significance of the enrichment of particular GO categories in our lists.
15459755:26	We also devised a new method for calculating the distance between gene lists based on the GO structure.
15459755:27	This allows one to assess the functional similarity, in “GO space,” of gene lists that may not have any actual genes in common (such as our TOM groups).
15459755:28	Furthermore, since the GO vocabulary is not specific to any species, this method allows for cross-species and cross-platform comparisons of gene lists.
15459755:29	Re-analysis of data from previous studies may reveal a functional stem cell signature in GO space that was not evident at the gene level ( ; ; ).
15459755:30	Applying GO analysis to the TOM groupings revealed elemental subgroups within the signature lists that allowed us to construct a molecular model of the HSC activation cycle.
15459755:31	The majority of unperturbed HSCs reside in a quiescence niche and express receptors, for example the metabolism- and ageing-associated receptor IGF1R and the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie1, that allow them to respond to multiple mitogenic signals ( A).
15459755:32	They also express high levels of transcription factors, such as c-fos and GATA-2, that enable swift activation of HSCs.
15459755:33	This expression profile, found in the TOM 0 and 30 groups, suggests that although adult HSCs are quiescent, they are in a “state of readiness” to react to changes in their environment.
15459755:34	Immediately after activation is triggered (here by 5FU), HSCs enter a superquiescent “pause.”
15459755:35	This state, found at TOM 1 and also observed by cell cycle analysis, is mediated by antiproliferative genes such as Tob1, p21, and Btg3 ( B).
15459755:36	Interestingly, p21 -null mice have defects in HSC self renewal.
15459755:37	We observed up-regulation of TIMP3 and the serine proteinase inhibitor A-3 g, which inhibit cell migration.
15459755:38	At least six interferon-γ-induced genes were also up-regulated at this point, suggesting that HSCs are responding to proinflammatory signals.
15459755:39	We speculate that the pause in HSC proliferation and migration allows HSCs to survive 5FU cytotoxicity while the cells simultaneously “prepare” to proliferate and repopulate the bone marrow to ensure survival of the animal.
15459755:40	In the early phase of proliferation starting at day 3, when increased numbers of HSCs in cell cycle are first detected, HSCs have committed to cell division, as can be seen by the maximal expression of genes involved in DNA replication and repair ( C).
15459755:41	At day 6, the late phase of proliferation, when the greatest number of HSCs are in cycle, we see expression of genes involved with energy production, indicating an overall increase in metabolic activity in the HSCs ( D).
15459755:42	Prior work has linked HSC mobilization with proliferation ( ; ), and our data indicate that the opposite is also true: to proliferate, HSCs need to move out of their quiescence niche and into a proliferative zone ( C and D).
15459755:43	We see the up-regulation of α4-integrin at day 3 followed by a dramatic decrease at day 6 post 5FU treatment.
15459755:44	Experiments that block α4-integrin function by blocking antibodies or via knockout technology have previously shown that down-regulation induces increased mobilization and delays recovery after 5FU treatment ( ; ).
15459755:45	The gene expression pattern displayed by α4-integrin predicts that down-regulation of α4-integrin is necessary for 5FU-induced proliferation.
15459755:46	As stated above, down-regulation of α4-integrin is sufficient to alter recovery of bone marrow progenitors after 5FU treatment, supporting the link between HSC proliferation and migration in our model.
15459755:47	Down-regulation of c-Kit has also been linked to mobilization of HSCs, and its expression is lowest at day 6 post treatment.
15459755:48	In order to “reset quiescence,” HSCs need to return to their niche ( E).
15459755:49	This process begins at day 10, when the number of cycling HSCs falls and HSCs express the high levels of specific antiproliferative genes such as Btg1 and several components of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway.
15459755:50	Both SOCS3 and STAT3 have been associated with both positive and negative regulation of proliferation and differentiation of various hematopoietic cell types.
15459755:51	Simultaneous expression of SOCS3, STAT3, and STAT6 suggests a complex regulation of HSC quiescence, but earlier work examining STAT signaling in other stem cell populations gave us insight into the role of JAK/STAT signaling in HSCs.
15459755:52	Expression of STATs has been shown to establish and maintain stem cell pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.
15459755:53	However in Drosophila testes, JAK/STAT activation is crucial for stem cell self renewal; perturbations by both loss and increase in expression lead to dramatic changes in the stem cell compartment.
15459755:54	Notably, activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by PKD1 induces cell cycle arrest through p21-dependent mechanisms.
15459755:55	This supports our hypothesis that JAK/STAT signaling is important for inducing quiescence at day 10, since we have shown that p21 is likely involved in HSC cell cycle arrest.
15459755:56	The involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in both stem cell pluripotency and HSC quiescence suggests that these processes may be linked in HSCs.
15459755:57	Endoglin, also found in the TOM 10 group, is known to be expressed on both murine and human HSCs, and has been shown to decrease cell migration by increasing cell–cell adhesion.
15459755:58	Its expression pattern was negatively correlated with 5FU-HSC proliferation: it was lowest at day 6 after 5FU treatment, and highest at day 10.
15459755:59	Our data suggest that HSC proliferation requires mobilization from the niche, and that restoration of quiescence is accompanied by a return to the niche.
15459755:60	Endoglin's expression pattern makes it an ideal candidate for mediating HSC-to-niche homing and long-term association.
15459755:61	Our model derived from gene expression profiles correlates well with the literature on HSC cell cycle and mobilization.
15459755:62	Although other models of HSC mobilization and 5FU treatment have previously been proposed, our data allow association of specific genes with particular stages of HSC activation and recovery.
15459755:63	Our model predicted that CD48 might preferentially mark cycling HSCs, and our cell cycle analysis of CD48 + and CD48 − HSCs confirmed this prediction.
15459755:64	Our model also postulates the presence of “quiescence” and “proliferative” zones in the bone marrow; osteoblasts may be a component of this quiescence niche ( ; ).
15459755:65	In summary, we present proliferation and quiescence signatures for HSCs that show remarkable overlap with published literature.
15459755:66	In addition, this study revealed new, uncharacterized genes whose role in HSC self renewal needs to be explored: some of these genes may play as yet undiscovered roles in the development of cancer or may aid in the manipulation of stem cells for therapeutic uses.
15459755:67	Finally, harnessing the GO using novel bioinformatics approaches to analyze our data at a global level allowed us to propose a model of the HSC activation cycle.

19436654:0	Simultaneous thromboses of two coronary artery stents: fostering bad synergies 
The patient is a 47-year-old woman from Morocco with a history of insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and obesity (body mass index: 33), admitted to our institution during the acute phase of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
19436654:1	One week before the current admission, the patient had been admitted to another center with progressive angina pectoris (functional class III).
19436654:2	Coronary angiography revealed severe coronary stenoses in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery (RCA) and in the distal segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
19436654:3	At that time, PCI of both lesions was performed by implanting a 2.25 × 8 mm sirolimus-eluting stent (Cypher ®, Cordis, Johnson and Johnson) in the distal LAD and a 2.5 × 13 mm stent in the proximal RCA.
19436654:4	The patient was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalycilic acid, ASA) 100 mg per day and clopidogrel 75 mg per day).
19436654:5	Five days after the procedure, however, the patient decided to stop ASA although remained on clopidogrel.
19436654:6	Two days later, the patient suffered from STEMI involving both anterior and inferior territories on the ECG.
19436654:7	She also suffered repeated episodes of ventricular fibrillation, but was successfully defibrillated.
19436654:8	The patient required inotropic support to maintain arterial pressure stability and was intubated because of repeated arrythmias.
19436654:9	Emergency coronary angiography was performed and revealed thromboses of both stents.
19436654:10	RCA thrombosis was tackled first with abciximab bolus + infusion.
19436654:11	The passage of the guidewire through the stent was very difficult requiring the use of different wires.
19436654:12	A hydrophilic wire was initially passed through the stent, but neither a thrombus aspiration catheter nor a 1.5 × 10 mm angioplasty balloon could cross through the stent successfully.
19436654:13	Not until a second wire was sited in parallel, while the balloon remained inserted over the first wire at the point where it stopped, could we successfully dilate the stent with noncompliant balloons (2.5 and 3.0 mm in diameter).
19436654:14	Finally a new drug-eluting stent (DES) (Xience™, Abbott Vascular 3.0 × 28 mm) was used to cover the entire segment including the more proximal segment of the RCA up to the distal part of the previously implanted stent.
19436654:15	A DES was chosen because the patient was diabetic.
19436654:16	A good angiographic result (TIMI 3 flow) was obtained.
19436654:17	The LAD artery was treated sequentially.
19436654:18	In this vessel, thrombus aspiration was effective and the result was optimized using a noncompliant balloon dilatation (2.5 × 9 mm) gaining a final TIMI 3 flow ( –C).
19436654:19	The patient could be transferred to her referral hospital and the initial outcome was uneventful.
19436654:20	Five days later, she was discharged on dual antiplatelet high-dose regimen (ASA 300 mg per day and clopidogrel 150 mg per day).
19436654:21	Before discharge, she received intensive counseling on the need for compliance with medication, and on secondary prevention to avoid further thrombotic events.
19436654:22	Diabetes mellitus: a prothrombotic state.
19436654:23	Implications for outcomes after coronary revascularization 
Conclusions 
Coronary revascularization in diabetic patients remains a challenge.
19436654:24	The introduction of DES has improved PCI outcomes, but the problem of atherothrombotic complications, including ST, persist for which DM is recognized as an independent predictor.
19436654:25	Inadequate responsiveness to currently available antiplatelet agents, including ASA and clopidogrel, may contribute to these poor outcomes.
19436654:26	Novel antiplatelet agents under advanced clinical investigation may provide future treatment alternatives to tackle the “diabetic platelet”.
19436654:27	Indeed, dedicated studies on selected diabetic patients are warranted, to understand the real magnitude and significance of the problem, and find an appropriate solution.
19087334:0	Background 
The greatest burden of leading communicable diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next two decades in the developing world.
19087334:1	In these countries, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is already the leading cause of mortality,  with mortality from ischemic heart disease expected to increase by 120% for women and 137% for men.
19087334:2	The increasing burden of CVD is largely due to the rising prevalence of many CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension.
19087334:3	Hypertension, once rare in traditional African societies is rapidly becoming a major public health problem,  because of the increasing urbanization.
19087334:4	Socioeconomic factors may influence the distribution of high blood pressure in the developing world.
19087334:5	However, how socioeconomic factors bring about the noticed pattern in hypertension is not clearly understood.
19087334:6	It is possible that in the less developed countries, the wealthy readily adopt unhealthy lifestyles, characterized by smoking, sedentarism and diets high in energy and fats.
19087334:7	Hypertension in adulthood may be related to persistent blood pressure elevation in children and adolescents.
19087334:8	Assessment and management of blood pressure in childhood is therefore strongly recommended to enhance cardiovascular health in adulthood.
19087334:9	This study was carried out to provide information on blood pressure patterns and its correlates in Nigerian adolescents from three different geographic areas of residence.
19087334:10	It is hoped that this would help in health policy formulation and the development of prevention strategies for hypertension and associated disorders.
19087334:11	Methods 
Results 
One thousand and eighty eight subjects participated in the study.
19087334:12	Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP respectively) increased with age irrespective of sex and geographic area of residence (Table ).
19087334:13	For both SBP and DBP, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the means of those aged 10 to 12 years compared to those aged 13 years.
19087334:14	Subjects aged 18–20 years had significantly higher (p < 0.05) SBP and DBP mean values than the others, except those aged 16 years.
19087334:15	However, comparing any of the ages younger than 14 years with any of those older than 14 years showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in their mean systolic but not diastolic blood pressures.
19087334:16	Both the heights and weights of the participants increased with age, though those aged 17 years were slightly shorter than those aged 16 years.
19087334:17	The differences in the mean heights of subjects of any age compared with those of any other age was significant (p < 0.05) except for the differences in the mean heights of those aged 16 and 17 years.
19087334:18	The mean weights of all the different ages differed significantly (p < 0.05) from each other.
19087334:19	The subjects' BMI also increased with age.
19087334:20	The increases were not however significant (p > 0.05) between those aged 13 years and 14 years, and between those aged 17 years and 18–20 years (Table ).
19087334:21	The systolic blood pressure of the participants for both sexes increased from the non-urban dwellers to the urban dwellers (Table ).
19087334:22	The differences in the systolic blood pressures of the two groups were significant (p < 0.05) for both sexes.
19087334:23	The systolic blood pressure of the urban males dropped in every other age from 10–12 years, thereby giving an ascending zigzag pattern as against the gradually ascending pattern of the non-urban group.
19087334:24	(Figure ).
19087334:25	All the two residential groups however, had their male systolic blood pressures peak at 18–20 years.
19087334:26	For the females, the systolic blood pressure of the urban dwellers dropped at 13 years, but thereafter rose gradually until it peaked at 18–20 years (Figure ).
19087334:27	Those of the non-urban females also peaked at 18–20 years, but were generally lower than those of the urban females.
19087334:28	Diastolic blood pressures were however higher in the non-urban dwellers when compared to the urban dwellers (Table ).
19087334:29	The difference in the means of diastolic pressure of the males of the urban area compared to the non-urban dwellers was significant (p < 0.05).
19087334:30	On the other hand, for the females, mean diastolic pressure differences were similar in both urban and non-urban dwellers.
19087334:31	The diastolic blood pressures of the males of the two groups gave each, an ascending pattern, and peaked at 18–20 years (Figure ).
19087334:32	For the females, the diastolic blood pressures all peaked at 18–20 years, with those of the urban dwellers ascending more steeply than those of the non-urban dwellers which hovered around 60 mmHg (Figure ).
19087334:33	Heights and weights were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urban male population compared to the non-urban male group.
19087334:34	The non-urban girls were however, significantly (p < 0.05) taller than the urban girls.
19087334:35	The weights of the girls in both groups were similar (Table ).
19087334:36	BMI increased from 20.60 ± 2.97 kg/m 2 and 20.33 ± 3.11 kg/m 2 for the females and males respectively of the non-urban population to 21.35 ± 3.37 kg/m 2 and 20.74 ± 3.27 kg/m 2 for females and males respectively of the urban group.
19087334:37	The difference between the mean BMI value of the females in the two groups was significant (p < 0.05).
19087334:38	For the males however, the difference between the mean BMI scores of the urban dwellers and the non-urban dwellers was not significant (p > 0.05).
19087334:39	(Table ) 
Correlation coefficients show that systolic blood pressure correlated positively with diastolic blood pressure (r = +0.500, p < 0.01).
19087334:40	Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures correlated positively with age (r = +0.305, p < 0.01 and r = +0.161, p < 0.01 respectively), weight (r = +0.390, p < 0.01 and r = +0.270, p < 0.01 respectively), height (r = +0.260, p < 0.01 and r = +0.122, p < 0.01 respectively) and BMI (r = +0.265, p < 0.01 and r = +0.230, p < 0.01 respectively).
19087334:41	However, while the correlation between diastolic blood pressure and geographic area of residence was negative and insignificant (r = -0.047, p > 0.05), systolic blood pressure correlated positively and significantly with geographic area of residence (r = +0.259, p < 0.01).
19087334:42	The multiple linear regression analysis showed that geographic area of residence was positively and significantly (β = +0.249, p < 0.01) associated with systolic blood pressure but negatively and significantly (β = -0.210, p < 0.01) associated with diastolic blood pressure.
19087334:43	Discussion 
The increase in blood pressure with age found in this study is consistent with the findings of other researchers both in Nigeria and elsewhere.
19087334:44	[ - ] This increase was not localized to any setting, though it was more prominent in the urban area.
19087334:45	Obika et al  and Agyemang et al  had earlier reported similar findings in the blood pressures of adolescents in different populations of sub Saharan Africa.
19087334:46	This suggests that the change in lifestyle that has been incriminated in the causation of the increasing prevalence of hypertension in sub Saharan African cities may also be creeping into the non-urban areas.
19087334:47	Though blood pressure generally increased with age, there were marked differences especially in the systolic blood pressures of urban dwellers when compared to non-urban dwellers.
19087334:48	Urban dwelling adolescents had significantly (p < 0.05) higher systolic blood pressures (both for males and females) than the non-urban group.
19087334:49	However, non-urban boys had significantly (p < 0.05) higher diastolic blood pressures when compared to those in the urban area.
19087334:50	These differences persisted even after adjusting for age and height.
19087334:51	The increase in diastolic blood pressure of the non-urban boys, relative to the urban boys apparently suggests a possible fading of the protection from blood pressure elevation which traditional non-urban sub-Saharan African societies once had.
19087334:52	Environmental factors that contribute to cases of high blood pressure, and the substantial disparity in the blood pressures across geographically different residential groups, are not well understood.
19087334:53	The relationship between geographic area of residence/socioeconomic status and blood pressure in the developing countries may be as a result of emerging new risk factors for hypertension like fetal under nutrition and psychosocial stress which may affect the poor disproportionately.
19087334:54	Granted that the pathway linking these variables is not clearly understood, what is worrisome is that childhood hypertension is a pointer to morbidity and mortality in adulthood.
19087334:55	The observed higher systolic blood pressures of the urban-dwelling adolescents is even more worrisome as about 25% of Nigerians currently live in cities and the figure is expected to double in the next twenty years.
19087334:56	The burden this, coupled with the reported elevation in diastolic blood pressure in rural boys, could place on the healthcare system is enormous.
19087334:57	The effect of BMI on high blood pressure has been demonstrated in other populations, [ - ] though the exact mechanism is poorly understood.
19087334:58	Our study showed that urban dwelling boys were significantly (p < 0.05) taller and heavier than (but had similar BMI with) their counterparts dwelling in non-urban areas.
19087334:59	The non-urban females had similar weights with their urban counterparts, but were however, significantly (p < 0.05) taller and had significantly (p < 0.05) lower BMI compared to the urban dwelling girls.
19087334:60	These may be related to access to food and physical exertion.
19087334:61	Systolic and diastolic blood pressures also correlated with height, weight and BMI, positively.
19087334:62	This trend emphasizes the role of lifestyle in increasing blood pressure, since increasing BMI is directly related to lifestyle – sedentarism, high energy and high fat diets, etc.
19087334:63	The problem here is that these lifestyles come with urbanization, and may increase with increasing socioeconomic empowerment.
19087334:64	However, in the developed countries, according to Mendez and colleagues,  the reverse is the case as high blood pressure is negatively correlated with socioeconomic status.
19087334:65	The said authors explain that in the developed economies, high socioeconomic status groups may be the first to adopt lifestyles that lower CVD risk, or to receive better treatment, while in the less developed countries, the rich (who are almost always urban dwellers) are the ones who engage in unhealthy lifestyles.
19087334:66	Our study may be limited by the fact that blood pressures were measured only at one visit.
19087334:67	We did not also assess salt intake and urinary sodium excretion in the subjects and could not lay hands on the birth weights of the children as most of them were not born in standard hospitals were appropriate records are kept.
19087334:68	Again, since pubertal maturation occurs at different times for the two sexes (and even for people of the same sex), and is accompanied by blood pressure increases, our data should be interpreted with caution.
19087334:69	This is because we did not assess pubertal status in the present study.
19087334:70	Male and female subjects in the non-urban areas were significantly younger than their counterparts in the urban areas.
19087334:71	This may be because of cultural practices that require girls to marry early, thereby dropping out of school.
19087334:72	Boys also often drop out of school and migrate to urban areas in search of better sources of livelihood.
19087334:73	Conclusion 
Our results show that blood pressure increased with age in the studied population, irrespective of the geographic area of residence.
19087334:74	SBP was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urban adolescents of both sexes, while DBP was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the non-urban males only.
19087334:75	These differences persisted after adjusting for age and height.
19087334:76	The anthropometric parameters measured and BMI were also positively associated with increase in blood pressure in both sexes.
19087334:77	We recommend that more work should be done on the blood pressure of children and adolescents since they are pointers of adult blood pressure patterns.
19087334:78	Steps should be taken to immediately address the rising trend of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents (irrespective of their place of domicile) as that would stem the rising prevalence of the associated disorders.

21385382:0	Findings 
In FCM, intact cells and their constituent components are tagged with fluorescently conjugated antibodies and/or stained with fluorescent reagents and then analyzed individually.
21385382:1	In a flow cytometer, cells in suspension are excited by a laser and the fluorescence emission from each cell is collected by a series of photomultiplier tubes.
21385382:2	Subsequent electrical events are collected and analyzed on a computer that assigns a fluorescence intensity value to each signal.
21385382:3	These values are stored in the Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data file format developed by ISAC in 1984 and it is still the common representation of FCM data supported by all instruments and FCM data analysis tools . FCS was recently extended to version 3.1 , correcting some ambiguities, improving support for international characters and storing compensation, and adding support for preferred display scale, sample volume, tracking originality of data files and plate and well identification.
21385382:4	While FCS is the essential data standard in FCM, and is supported by all instrument vendors and third party software tools, it does not capture the protocol used or the computational post-processing and data analysis performed in an FCM experiment.
21385382:5	Recently, ISAC's Data Standards Task Force (DSTF) developed additional file formats capturing details about FCM data analysis as required by the Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment (MIFlowCyt, ).
21385382:6	Gating-ML File Format 
In FCM, the process for selecting populations of interest is known as gating.
21385382:7	This process is traditionally conducted manually by drawing boundaries around cell populations, and this activity is supported by all FCM analysis software applications.
21385382:8	However the definition of the boundaries has not been exchangeable between software tools, which are each storing this information in their own specific, often binary format.
21385382:9	The lack of software interoperability on the gating level is a major bottleneck preventing independent reproducibility of FCM data analysis, usage of multiple analytical tools, and development of novel analytical and clinical methods.
21385382:10	A standard formal way of exchanging unambiguous descriptions of gates is crucial for interoperability among analytical hardware and software applications.
21385382:11	To address this need, the Extensible Markup Language (XML)  was chosen as a simple, open, flexible, self-describing, properly established, widely supported, and therefore well suited technology.
21385382:12	In 2008, ISAC's DSTF developed an initial specification of Gating-ML  - an XML-based file format accommodating exact and reproducible descriptions of gates.
21385382:13	The Gating-ML specification is increasingly supported by both commercial software vendors (e.g., TreeStar Inc., makers of FlowJo, Cytobank Inc.) as well as open source software, such as the flowCore/flowUtils  R/BioConductor  packages.
21385382:14	With these reference implementations now available, the Gating-ML Candidate Recommendation is under revision as a first version of the official ISAC standard for computational description of gates.
21385382:15	Classification Results File Format 
Recently, the increased amount of high-throughput and high-content FCM data motivated the development of various automated methods to supplement manual gating.
21385382:16	Similar to manual gating, the results of these methods are commonly per-event-based, potentially fuzzy, classifications expressed as the probability of a cell being a member of a class of cells.
21385382:17	Unlike manual gating, the geometrical boundaries of these automatically derived classes are often difficult or even impossible to define, which prevents or complicates the use of Gating-ML.
21385382:18	The Classification Results (CLR ) File Format is currently being finalized to address this issue.
21385382:19	While Gating-ML contains mathematical definitions of gates, the CLR format only captures results of the gating process (i.e., the assignment of cells to classes of cells (e.g., cell types)).
21385382:20	Consequently, the CLR format is usable for the results of both manual and automated gating.
21385382:21	While XML or similarly expressive technologies could have been utilized for this purpose, a simpler format is sufficient and essentially beneficial for end users in this case.
21385382:22	Therefore, the CLR specification has been based on the common CSV  file format and consequently, a CLR file can be easily parsed, and can be created and viewed using commonly available spreadsheet software.
21385382:23	Archival Cytometry Standard File Format 
The Archival Cytometry Standard (ACS) was developed to bundle data with all the other components describing experiments.
21385382:24	Besides capturing relations among data and other files, the requirements for such a file format included the support for audit trails, versioning and digital signatures.
21385382:25	Several alternatives have been considered.
21385382:26	For example, RDF  and related semantic web technologies have been evaluated in terms of capabilities to capture experimental work flows.
21385382:27	While very promising, these technologies are still evolving and they do not have a stable support in existing tools.
21385382:28	Therefore, the Data Standards Task Force chose a more conservative approach based on widely-accepted tools and technologies.
21385382:29	As a result, the ACS container is based on the ZIP file format with an XML-based Table of Contents specifying relations among files in the container.
21385382:30	Since ACS is based on the ZIP file format and ZIP is supported on virtually all platforms, it is possible to create ACS containers without specialized software tools.
21385382:31	In addition, W3C XML Signatures  have been incorporated to facilitate the audit trail with appropriate digital signatures.
21385382:32	Similar to the other mentioned formats, ACS is increasingly being supported by commercial and open source software and data repositories.
21385382:33	Example Dataset 
We provide the first example of how these recently developed standardized file formats can be used to report FCM data including analysis and results in a standardized, computationally exchangeable form within an ACS container (see Additional file ).
21385382:34	The ACS container captures data and an analytical pipeline as shown in Figure . The ACS container includes two FCS data files acquired on an LSR II cytometer as part of an immune response study, two preprocessed FCS data files, two Gating-ML files capturing the process of manual gating, two CLR files with results of automated clustering, and an XML-based table of contents capturing relations among all the components.
21385382:35	The original FCS files are randomly chosen from a set of FCM data samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
21385382:36	Each sample is stimulated by a specific microbe-derived danger signal at a specific concentration in order to investigate in cellular detail the recognition and responses of human antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the danger signals of interest.
21385382:37	APCs form a major group of cells in the immune system responsible for detecting foreign microbes and presenting them to other immunity cells for further actions.
21385382:38	Subpopulations of APCs include monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), each of which differ in functionality as they respond differently when challenged with the same danger signals.
21385382:39	APCs respond to danger signals in a number of ways, one of which is through secretion of cytokines.
21385382:40	Cytokines are cell-signalling molecules that are used in intercellular communications, and can activate other immune cells to take further actions against microbes and pathogens.
21385382:41	Our example FCS data files contain measurements corresponding to physical characteristics of the cells (i.e., forward and side scatter), cell surface proteins (CD123, CD11c, MHC-II, CD14), and intracellular cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF- α IFN- α ).
21385382:42	During the analysis, an initial series of preprocessing steps were applied to the data.
21385382:43	This included the removal of dead cells and debris, compensation and subsetting to the desired channels.
21385382:44	Then the cell surface proteins measurements of the preprocessed FCS files are used to gate the files manually with the purpose of identifying cell populations including monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs, including myeloid and plasmacytoid subpopulations - mDCs and pDCs), as well as two additional novel populations, whose roles in the immune response still need to be further investigated.
21385382:45	Parallel to the manual approach, the preprocessed FCS files were analyzed using the SamSPECTRAL  clustering algorithm, followed by a semi-automated cluster matching technique to identify the desired populations automatically.
21385382:46	Populations identified by automated clustering were compared to manually gated populations in order to determine the suitability of this automated approach in identification of cell populations of interest.
21385382:47	Information corresponding to the results of these analyses were captured in a computer processable form in the ACS container.
21385382:48	A combination of tools was used to create the ACS container and it's components.
21385382:49	Compensation and the live cell gates were created in FlowJo.
21385382:50	The spillover matrix and gate coordinates were exported from FlowJo and used in the flowCore  R/BioConductor  package in order to preprocess the FCS data files.
21385382:51	The preprocessed FCS files were manually gated in FlowJo and the gates were exported in Gating-ML.
21385382:52	In parallel, the SamSPECTRAL  clustering algorithm was applied on the preprocessed data and resulting clusters were labelled and the results were saved in the CLR file format using the write.table
21385382:53	R function.
21385382:54	All files were manually organized in file system folders in an ACS-like structure and a table of contents was created according to the ACS specification.
21385382:55	The oXygen software tool (Syncro Soft Ltd.) was used to adjust and validate XML-based components of the container (i.e., the table of contents and the Gating-ML files).
21385382:56	Finally, the ACS-like folder structure was zipped using Ubuntu's built-in compression support (any ZIP-compatible tool could have been used) and the file extension of the resulting file was changed to .acs as required by the ACS specification.
21385382:57	Conclusions 
Reporting standards and open file formats are essential components allowing for scientific collaboration and independent validation.
21385382:58	The purpose of publishing this small subset of the data is to demonstrate the use of novel open file formats to computationally describe the analysis of FCM data.
21385382:59	As it is often the case with new standards, their adoption requires investments at the beginning that will result in benefits down the road.
21385382:60	In FCM, several leading software and hardware vendors have already incorporated support for the recently developed standards and therefore, these novel file formats are now effectively coming to the flngertips of researchers and other end users.
21385382:61	Having the raw data along with the mechanism of analysis and results provided in a machine processable description makes the analysis reproducible, which is usually not the case with only figures and free text descriptions provided in most manuscripts . Unfortunately, even with appropriate data and meta data standards in place, due to the lack of a public repository there is still a bottleneck preventing FCM data to be efficiently reusable.
21385382:62	In order to address this issue, ISAC is currently developing a public data repository that will allow for annotated FCM data to be openly shared, which will ultimately facilitate third-party understanding and reuse of these data.
21385382:63	This repository will support all relevant standards and will allow researchers to deposit annotated FCM data and associated analysis files along with MIFlowCyt-compliant textual descriptions of experiments.

21797999:0	Background 
The method of using segmental pedicle screw fixation in scoliosis surgery was presented by Suk in 1994 . Recently a quantitative study showed that rod derotation and direct vertebral derotation can significantly improve the 3-dimensional correction of scoliotic deformity . Besides lateral curvature of vertebral column in the coronal plane, scoliotic deformities also include changes in the sagittal plane such as thoracic hypokyphosis or even lordosis and are always associated with rotation of vertebral bodies in the axial plane.
21797999:1	While standing plain radiography still is the most common method to assess the correction in coronal and sagittal planes, studies have shown that computed tomography (CT) is superior to plain radiography in the assessment of the degree of vertebral rotation . Low-dose spine CT with significant reduction of the radiation dose has recently been introduced as a reliable method in the work-up of scoliosis . To the best of our knowledge there is no report on assessment of the degree of vertebral derotation after scoliosis surgery using low-dose spine CT.
21797999:2	Furthermore, the published reports on the correction of vertebral rotation often present the correction rates for the whole study period, which probably overshadow the improvement of correction ability over time-"the learning curve" for the surgeon.
21797999:3	The knowledge on the effect of learning and cumulative experience has, to our knowledge, not previously been studied with regard to the deformity correction in all three planes by using the most reliable methods for evaluation of deformity in each plane.
21797999:4	The Suk technique was introduced at the Orthopaedic Department of our hospital in autumn 2005, after a study visit to Seoul by the senior author.
21797999:5	The implants used were made of titanium alloy with rod diameter of 5.5 mm during 2005-2006; thereafter, the rod diameter was 6.35 mm.
21797999:6	The change in radius alters stiffness to the 4 th power of the change in radius.
21797999:7	Consequently, the bending stiffness has increased from 5.17 EI (Nm 2) for rod diameter of 5.5 to 9.18 EI (Nm 2) for rod diameter of 6.35 mm.
21797999:8	The stiffness of a rod is related to its ability to hold correction and minimize changes in rod curvature; the stiffer the rod, the less changes . Previous studies have shown that greater construct stiffness was at least partially dependant on the diameter of rod of the constructs .
21797999:9	However, the anchors used in these 2 experimental studies were not pedicle screws.
21797999:10	The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the 3-dimentional deformity correction achieved by posterior corrective surgery using "all pedicle screw construct" in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
21797999:11	The second aim of the study was to find out if there was any improvement in the degree of deformity correction during different periods of the study and whether this improvement was dependant on learning or the change to rods of larger diameter.
21797999:12	Methods 
Pre- and postoperative plain radiographs and low-dose spine CTs of 116 consecutive patients with AIS who underwent posterior corrective surgery with titanium-alloy (Ti-6AI-4V) during the period 2005-2009 were evaluated retrospectively.
21797999:13	The patients were categorized into four period groups according to the date of operation (group 1: patients operated on in autumn 2005-2006, group 2: 2007, group 3: 2008, and group 4: 2009).
21797999:14	As the number of patients operated on in autumn 2005 was only 7, these were included in the first period with patients operated on in 2006.
21797999:15	Ninety four patients (81%) were female and 22 patients (19%) were male.
21797999:16	The patients were identified from the database of the Orthopaedic Department and the database of the Radiology Department of our hospital.
21797999:17	All patients had been examined with standing posteroanterior (PA) and lateral radiographs as well as with low-dose spine CT before surgery and six weeks postoperatively.
21797999:18	The measurements performed on plain radiographs before and after surgery were: (1) Cobb angle of the major curve on standing PA-radiographs, (2) The degree of kyphosis at T5-T12 on standing lateral radiographs, and (3) Lower end vertebra tilt (LEVT), which is defined as the angle between the lower endplate of the lower end vertebra of the major curve and the horizontal plane, measured on standing PA-radiographs.
21797999:19	All CT-examinations were performed on a 16-slice scanner (SOMATOM Sensation 16, Siemens AG, Forchheim, Germany) according to our low-dose spine CT protocol: Slice collimation 16 × 0.75 mm, rotation time 0.75 s, pitch 1.5, tube voltage 80 kV and quality reference for the effective tube current-time product 25 mAs.
21797999:20	The measurement of vertebral rotation was performed at the most rotated vertebra at the apex of the major curve as well as at one adjacent vertebra on either side of the apex.
21797999:21	These measurements were performed at the same vertebral levels before and after surgery.
21797999:22	The degree of vertebral rotation was measured according to the method of Aaro and Dahlborn . All measurements were performed by an experienced radiologist with specialized spine profile.
21797999:23	The pre- and postoperative data which were collected from the medical and the radiological records of the patients included: age, gender, diagnosis, Lenke classification, date of operation, and the type of the operation.
21797999:24	The approval of the Regional Radiation Protection Committee to use the low-dose spine CT in the work-up of patients with AIS was obtained.
21797999:25	Results 
Discussion 
This study has shown that scoliosis correction using segmental pedicle screw fixation according to Suk, resulted in a deformity correction with reduction of Cobb angle, LEVT, and vertebral rotation by 38.4° (69%), 19° (68%), and 6.5° (37%), respectively, as well as restoration of the thoracic kyphosis by 4° (24%).
21797999:26	We also have shown that a significant improvement in correction of axial rotation and restoration of the thoracic sagittal profile was observed between the first period of the study (2005-2006) and the remaining periods of the study (2007-2009).
21797999:27	However, the difference between the correction of these deformities among the first 17 and the last 17 patients operated on in the first period of the study was not statistically significant, indicating that the improvement was not the result of the initial learning curve of the surgeon.
21797999:28	However, cumulative experience, improvement in surgical techniques including the DVR, and a more frequent use of posterior release as well as a more liberal use of in situ bending of the concave rod prior to the introduction of the stabilising rod on the convexity could possibly might have contributed to successively improved correction in the remaining periods of the study.
21797999:29	The use of in situ rod bending is often difficult with stiffer rods and may induce screw loosening, as the manoeuver means applying compression and distraction forces to the screws in this phase of correction.
21797999:30	The major improvement of the deformity correction seemed to coincide with the change to stiffer rods (from rod with 5.5 mm to 6.35 mm diameter).
21797999:31	The ideal fixation system in the posterior spinal fixation has been a matter of debate.
21797999:32	While some studies showed that stiffness of spine implants may far exceed the requirement for successful fusion and predispose to secondary disc degeneration of the adjacent levels , others showed that constructs with larger rod diameter resulted in stiffer fusion masses with no evidence of stress shielding .
21797999:33	However, the anchors used in the aforementioned study were not pedicle screws.
21797999:34	Our study showed that larger rod diameter and consequently stiffer rods resulted in improvement of the magnitude of deformity correction in the axial and the sagittal planes.
21797999:35	This study has also shown that the deformity correction at the end of the study period was comparable with most of the recent reports in the literature [ - ].
21797999:36	The issue of restoration of the thoracic kyphosis has been discussed in many previous reports [ - ].
21797999:37	A reduction of vertebral rotation of 7.1° (42.5%) and a restoration of the thoracic kyphosis varying from 4°  to 7°  was reported.
21797999:38	In the last report , the restoration of the thoracic kyphosis by 7° was achieved by using rigid rods (Cotrel-Dubousset 7.0 mm, stainless).
21797999:39	No study is without limitations.
21797999:40	One of the limitation of this study was its retrospective nature.
21797999:41	This restrained us to analyze for e.g. the preoperative flexibility of the curves as they were not always done with the fulcrum test.
21797999:42	This study, however, constitute a consecutive series of patients with AIS of different Lenke that were operated on at one institution using almost the same surgical technique (performed or supervised by one surgeon, the senior author).
21797999:43	As Lenke curve types were evenly distributed in different study periods, we assume that the degree of flexibility was also evenly distributed among these groups.
21797999:44	Another limitation was the relatively smaller number of patients operated on with a rod diameter of 5.5 mm (n = 34) compared with those operated on with larger rods (n = 84).
21797999:45	As mentioned before, cumulative experience, improvement in surgical techniques including the DVR, and a more frequent use of posterior release as well as a more liberal use of in situ bending of the concave rod prior to the introduction of the stabilizing rod on the convexity could possibly might have contributed to successively improved correction in the later periods of the study.
21797999:46	We believe that the findings of this study are of adequate clinical significance that warrants further studies evaluating the impact of different degrees of rod stiffness on deformity correction including a larger number of patients.
21797999:47	Conclusion 
This study showed that larger rod diameter (stiffer rods) had a positive impact on the deformity in the sagittal and the axial planes.
21797999:48	Initial learning curve seems in our study to be of minor importance for the outcome of the deformity correction.

15630480:0	Introduction 
Methionine synthases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (CH 3-H 4folate) to L-homocysteine (Hcy), the terminal step in the biosynthesis of methionine.
15630480:1	Two apparently unrelated families of proteins catalyze this reaction: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH; EC 2.1.1.13) and cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE; 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate–homocysteine methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.14) Organisms that synthesize or transport B 12 encode the cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas organisms that cannot obtain B 12 encode only the cobalamin-independent enzyme. and many other species of bacteria express both enzymes, but mammals utilize only cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase while plants and yeasts utilize only the cobalamin-independent enzyme.
15630480:2	MetH and MetE both face the same mechanistic challenge.
15630480:3	They must catalyze the transfer of a very poor leaving group from the tertiary amine, CH 3-H 4folate, to a relatively poor nucleophile, the sulfur of Hcy.
15630480:4	MetH facilitates this transfer by using cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier . Cobalamin accepts a methyl group from CH 3-H 4folate at one active site and donates it to Hcy at a second site . In contrast, MetE appears to catalyze the direct transfer of the methyl group from CH 3-H 4folate to Hcy . This latter strategy seems to offer a less satisfactory answer to the mechanistic problems: measured k cat values for MetE are smaller than those for MetH by a factor of approximately 50–100.
15630480:5	MetE and MetH both activate Hcy by binding the thiolate form of the substrate to Zn +2 . A similar strategy for alkylation of thiol groups is employed in protein farnesyltransferase , geranylgeranyltransferase , methanol:CoM methyltransferase (MtaA) , the DNA repair Ada protein , and betaine–Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT) .
15630480:6	However, the sets of zinc ligands and the structures that house the zinc-binding sites are not conserved within this functional family.
15630480:7	In particular, the metal ligands and their positions in the sequence are not the same in MetH and MetE.
15630480:8	Three cysteines bind the essential zinc in MetH; the first cysteine ligand resides at the end of strand 6 of a (βα) 8 barrel, and the remaining vicinal cysteine ligands follow strand 8.
15630480:9	A histidine and two cysteines have been identified as metal ligands in MetE by a combination of mutagenesis experiments  and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements . The relative positions of these residues in the sequence led to the prediction that in a (βα) 8 MetE barrel the histidine and cysteine ligands would reside at the ends of strands 5 and 8 . 
In contrast, the sequences of MetE enzymes give few if any clues to the strategy for binding and activation of folate by MetE.
15630480:10	Thus, the mode of folate binding is a key question to be addressed by structure analysis.
15630480:11	In both MetE and MetH, activation of the leaving group is thought to involve the protonation of CH 3-H 4folate in a ternary complex, E·Hcy·CH 3-H 4folate in MetE, or E·cob(I)alamin·CH 3-H 4folate in MetH .
15630480:12	However, the residues that may facilitate protonation have not been identified for either enzyme.
15630480:13	MetE appears to have evolved through gene duplication of a sequence encoding a domain of approximately 340 residues that binds and activates Hcy.
15630480:14	Within the family of MetE enzymes, the N- and C-terminal halves exhibit significant sequence homology.
15630480:15	The C-terminal half is more highly conserved than the N-terminal half and has homologs in archae and elsewhere.
15630480:16	Among these thiol methyltransferases are several enzymes that are approximately half the size of MetE and utilize corrinoid proteins, rather than folates, as methyl donors.
15630480:17	Taken together, these observations suggested that the MetE gene arose as the result of a primordial gene duplication event followed by loss of zinc- and Hcy-binding determinants from the duplicated sequence . If this hypothesis is correct, the two halves of the MetE sequence should display structural homology, and the N-terminal domain should be more closely related to the C-terminal domain than to any other protein in the database.
15630480:18	To determine how MetE has assembled an active site for catalysis of direct methyl transfer from CH 3-H 4folate to Hcy, we have solved the crystal structure of MetE at 2.0 Å resolution, along with structures of the binary substrate complexes with Hcy and folate.
15630480:19	Difficulties in crystallization of the enzyme were circumvented by analyzing the MetE from . This thermophilic bacterium encodes orthologs of MetH and MetE.
15630480:20	MetE (TM1286) is 41% identical to the enzyme and is only 19 residues shorter than MetE, making it an excellent prototype for the MetE family.
15630480:21	MetE comprises two (βα) 8 barrels.
15630480:22	To our knowledge, it is the first example of a dual-(βα) 8 barrel enzyme in which the active site is located between barrels arranged in a head-to-head orientation.
15630480:23	MetE also provides a rare example of a catalytic zinc site in which four residues serve as metal ligands.
15630480:24	Repetition of features within the structure supports the idea that MetE evolved through gene duplication of a primordial zinc/Hcy (βα) 8 barrel.

16951722:0	What is the Evidence for Aromatherapy?
16951722:1	A recent review of the evidence for sensory stimulation in dementia care suggests that aromatherapy with lemon balm or lavender oil decreases agitation in patients with dementia.
16951722:2	In other populations there are anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of aromatherapy in calming people with autistic spectrum disorders and helping people sleep and relax, although a systematic review of the field found little satisfactory evidence for the claims.
16951722:3	Nevertheless, one of the review authors claimed that there was good evidence for a relaxing effect.
16951722:4	The situation is complicated by the fact that aromatherapy is often delivered as a massage, and research studies have not identified clearly which is the active ingredient.
16951722:5	Trials of massage interventions alone have clearly established beneficial effects in chronic pain and situations where muscle relaxation is required.
16951722:6	In an experimental study published last year, Kuriyama and co-workers were unable to identify psychological effects of aroma over that of the massage alone, but did find physiological effects of aromatic oils over and above that of the carrier oil massage.
16951722:7	In this investigation we sought to demonstrate the effects of an aromatherapy massage.
16951722:8	How could Aromatherapy Massage help Children with Autism?
16951722:9	Children with autism have problems establishing a regular diurnal pattern and in remaining asleep through the night ( – ).
16951722:10	Some of these difficulties may be owing to over arousal or agitation.
16951722:11	Given the effects of aromatherapy massage in dementia and the wider claims of the effects of aromatherapy on sleep and arousal, we sought to examine whether aromatherapy massage enabled an improved sleep pattern in children with autism.
16951722:12	During waking hours the behavior of children with autism is characterized by repetitive activities such as stereotyped behavior, which are thought to be the result of non-optimal levels (over and under arousal) of arousal.
16951722:13	The putative mode of action of aromatherapy would be that it enabled an arousal level closer to the optimal, and hence, made sleep both easier to achieve and to maintain.
16951722:14	The aims of the study were therefore to examine whether aromatherapy delivered through massage resulted in faster sleep onset, longer sleep durations or fewer sleep interruptions.
16951722:15	Methods 
Results 
Complete data were available for 11 children.
16951722:16	The analyses reported below are for Sunday through Thursday nights of 3 weeks.
16951722:17	Data from 17 nights of a possible 24 nights were examined, of which 3 nights included aromatherapy massage as part of the evening schedule.
16951722:18	From the 24 possible nights, 3 Fridays and Saturdays were excluded because only 3 children stayed for those nights; a further one night was excluded from analysis because 2 children had been at home on that night.
16951722:19	There was little variability in the average time the children fell asleep.
16951722:20	The children fell asleep on average between 10:30 p.m. and 11:15 p.m.
16951722:21	A repeated measures analysis of variance comparing nights with and without aromatherapy revealed that there was no night with a statistically significant different sleep onset time (Greenhouse–Geisser corrected F = 1.27; df = 4.15, 41.5; P = 0.30).
16951722:22	There was however a significant participant effect suggesting that there were systematic differences in the times at which individual children fell asleep ( F = 59.83; df = 1, 10; P < 0.001; meansleep onset time range 9:30 p.m. and 11:40 p.m. ).
16951722:23	In total only 22 sleep interruptions were recorded.
16951722:24	Seven of the children slept through all the nights without any interruptions.
16951722:25	Of the four remaining children, there were between 0.11 and 0.5 interruptions per night (i.e. between one awakening every nine nights and one every other night).
16951722:26	There were no significant differences between the nights with and without aromatherapy (Friedman test χ 2 = 20.19; df = 16; P = 0.21).
16951722:27	The length of time the children were asleep was also subject to a repeated measures analysis of variance which showed that there was no significant difference between the nights with and without aromatherapy ( F = 0.59; df = 16, 160; P = 0.89).
16951722:28	The children slept on average between 7.25.and
16951722:29	8.25 h per night.
16951722:30	There was however a statistically significant child effect suggesting that different children had significantly different sleep durations ( F = 1411.4; df = 1, 10; P < 0.001; ).
16951722:31	The average number of hours slept per child ranged between 6.85 and 8.88 h.
14662744:0	Introduction 
The survival of cells of the nervous system is dependent on the action of neurotrophic factors that prevent both intrinsic and extrinsic cues from inducing cellular apoptosis.
14662744:1	In developing peripheral neurons, neurotrophic target-derived factors, such as NGF, retrogradely determine neuronal survival by suppressing autocrine and p75 NTR-induced apoptotic signals.
14662744:2	This interplay between life and death signals precisely regulates neuron number during development.
14662744:3	The initial step in NGF survival signaling is the stimulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the NGF receptor, TrkA, which in turn activates key survival and axonal growth regulatory proteins such as PI 3-kinase, Akt, and MEK/MAPK ( ; ).
14662744:4	The activated survival proteins suppress the activity of apoptotic proteins such as Bad, Forkhead, p53, and BAX ( ; ), and increase the levels and activities of pro-survival proteins such as CREB, Bcl-2, and ΔNp73 ( ; ).
14662744:5	NGF-activated TrkA initiates survival signaling by binding to and phosphorylating on tyrosine proteins such as Shc, FRS-2, rAPS, and SH2-B that activate the Ras–PI 3-kinase and Ras–MAPK signaling pathways and PLC-γ1, which regulates protein kinase C activity and intracellular calcium levels ( ; ).
14662744:6	The major sites whereby Trk associates with and couples to intracellular signaling pathways in primary neurons are the SHC/FRS-2 and the PLC-γ1 binding sites, Y490 and Y785, respectively.
14662744:7	Although TrkA functions by phosphorylating on tyrosine and thereby activating signaling proteins involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, paradoxically, it also activates the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) phosphatase SHP-1.
14662744:8	Because phosphatases such as SHP-1 can have both positive and negative effects on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, we asked about the function and mechanism of action of this protein in NGF signal transduction.
14662744:9	The SHP family of protein tyrosine phosphatases includes SHP-1, SHP-2, and the Drosophila melanogaster homologue Corkscrew.
14662744:10	SHP-1 is expressed in the hematopoietic system, the nervous system, epithelial cells, and the NGF-responsive PC12 cell line.
14662744:11	The motheaten ( me/me ) mouse, which lacks SHP-1 expression, displays an array of hematopoietic abnormalities resulting in severe immunodeficiency and systemic autoimmunity.
14662744:12	The pathology of the me/me mouse, which is caused by the overproduction of multiple hematopoietic cell lineages, initially suggested that SHP-1 was primarily a negative regulator of cell proliferation.
14662744:13	In this regard, SHP-1 has been shown to interact with and dephosphorylate a number of growth factor receptors, including those for insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet-derived growth factor, EGF, and Ros.
14662744:14	In contrast, SHP-1, like SHP-2, has been shown to positively regulate MAPK signaling ( ; ), as well as EGF, interferon-γ, and Ras signaling ( ; ).
14662744:15	The positive effects of SHP-1 signaling may explain why the absence of SHP-1 in me/me mice leads to decreased numbers of central nervous system glia.
14662744:16	Whereas the survival and growth-promoting aspects of neurotrophin signaling are dependent on the levels of TrkA receptor autophosphorylation initiated by NGF binding; the existence of phosphatases that dephosphorylate TrkA would suggest an additional and important mechanism of neurotrophin receptor regulation.
14662744:17	In this regard, our previous work in PC12 cells showed that SHP-1 was activated after NGF treatment of PC12 cells.
14662744:18	Here, we have asked about the biological importance of this activation in two cell types that require TrkA signaling for their survival, developing sympathetic neurons, and PC12 cells ( ; ).
14662744:19	Our results indicate that SHP-1 functions as a TrkA phosphatase, controlling the level of TrkA activity in cultured neurons and PC12 cells and regulating the number of NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons during development.
14662744:20	Results 
Discussion 
In this work, we examined the role of the SHP-1 pTyr phosphatase in neurotrophin-mediated cell survival and signal transduction.
14662744:21	Our results indicate that SHP-1 is a TrkA phosphatase in PC12 cells and in sympathetic neurons in culture and in vivo, and that it functions to ensure low levels of basal TrkA activation and to attenuate long-term TrkA signaling in the presence of NGF.
14662744:22	These conclusions are supported by four findings.
14662744:23	First, we show that SHP-1 dephosphorylated TrkA in vivo and in vitro, and that dephosphorylation was predominantly at sites that controlled TrkA activity (Y674 and Y675).
14662744:24	Second, overexpression of SHP-1 in sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells resulted in apoptosis as a consequence of TrkA dephosphorylation.
14662744:25	Third, inhibition of endogenous SHP-1 activity was sufficient to support NGF-independent neuronal survival as a consequence of enhanced basal TrkA phosphorylation and downstream Akt activation.
14662744:26	Inhibition of endogenous SHP-1 also led to sustained and elevated TrkA activation in the presence of NGF.
14662744:27	Fourth, sympathetic neuron number was higher in mice genetically deficient in SHP-1, presumably as a consequence of enhanced TrkA activation during the period of naturally occurring neuronal death; neurons from these mice survived in limiting amounts of NGF.
14662744:28	Together, these results argue that SHP-1 is a key negative regulator of TrkA-initiated signal transduction, and that it mediates this negative regulation largely at the level of the TrkA receptor.
14662744:29	Such regulation is critical for maintaining the trophic factor dependence of at least one population of neurons during the naturally occurring cell death period, a dependence that is essential for establishing appropriate neuronal connectivity.
14662744:30	How does SHP-1 regulate TrkA activity?
14662744:31	We propose that SHP-1 regulates both basal and NGF-stimulated TrkA activity.
14662744:32	Because inhibition of endogenous SHP-1 stimulates the NGF-independent phosphorylation of TrkA, SHP-1 can regulate the basal, nonliganded activity of TrkA.
14662744:33	TrkA activity, in the absence of NGF, is thus normally controlled and suppressed by SHP-1 activity.
14662744:34	In the presence of NGF, TrkA is efficiently dimerized and hyperactivated, and TrkA tyrosine kinase activity predominates over basal SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity.
14662744:35	The enhanced TrkA activity results in receptor transphosphorylation, followed by recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to TrkA transphosphorylation sites, and TrkA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates that in turn stimulates survival and growth pathways.
14662744:36	However, SHP-1 is also recruited to and stimulated by NGF-bound TrkA, resulting in an increase in SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity.
14662744:37	The increase in SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity would result in an attenuation of TrkA activity.
14662744:38	Thus, we propose a model whereby SHP-1 either directly or indirectly associates with TrkA, resulting in an increase in SHP-1 activity followed by dephosphorylation of TrkA at the Y674 and Y675 sites; a similar mechanism is used by the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B to regulate the insulin receptor.
14662744:39	The dephosphorylation of these sites results in decreased TrkA biochemical and biological activity and subsequent decreased activation of NGF-signaling proteins.
14662744:40	Therefore, we suggest that SHP-1 has two functions: (1) to keep TrkA in an “off” state in the absence of ligand, and (2) to modulate TrkA activity after dimerization and activation of TrkA by NGF.
14662744:41	What is the role of SHP-1 during sympathetic neuron development?
14662744:42	We propose that SHP-1 has two functions: (1) to control TrkA activity in the absence of NGF, and (2) to “fine-tune” TrkA-mediated survival signals in the presence of NGF.
14662744:43	Correct neuron number during sympathetic development is dependent on the functional interplay of TrkA-induced survival signals and p75 NTR-induced apoptotic signals ( ; ).
14662744:44	Mice deficient in TrkA lack most sympathetic neurons, whereas mice deficient in p75 NTR have twice the number of sympathetic neurons per ganglia in the SCG at P20.
14662744:45	me/me mice that lack SHP-1 have 35% more neurons than wt mice ( A), indicating that SHP-1 functions during development to either suppress TrkA activity or the activity of other apoptotic signals.
14662744:46	On the basis of our work in cultured SCG neurons, we favor the former hypothesis.
14662744:47	In particular, we propose that SHP-1 is essential to keep TrkA off in neurons that have not contacted the correct targets and/or are late arriving, and subsequently, have not sequestered sufficient levels of NGF.
14662744:48	Any basal TrkA activation in these neurons would serve to undermine the biological purpose of the cell death period, which is to ensure that only those neurons that are appropriately connected are maintained.
14662744:49	Moreover, even in neurons that have sequestered limited NGF, SHP-1 regulation of TrkA signaling may well serve to regulate the precise balance between “positive” TrkA and “negative” p75 NTR signaling, a balance that is essential for establishment of appropriate neuron numbers.
14662744:50	Until recently, SHP-1 expression was largely thought to be restricted to the hematopoietic system.
14662744:51	However, recent studies have demonstrated that SHP-1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system in both neurons ( ; ) and glia.
14662744:52	SHP-1 plays a key role in oligodendrocyte and glial development, as me/me mice display decreased numbers of central nervous system glia and dysmyelination ( ; ).
14662744:53	Together, these observations suggest an important role for SHP-1 in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, a role that we propose is mediated at least partially via regulation of the TrkA neurotrophin receptor.

19707263:0	Introduction 
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a pathologic process which may contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms in aging men.
19707263:1	A common problem among males over 50 years, its prevalence increases with age and many longitudinal studies have demonstrated the progressive nature of the disease.
19707263:2	Histologically, BPH is characterized by an increased number of both epithelial and stromal cells in the periurethral area of the prostate.
19707263:3	There is controversy as to whether this increase is secondary to epithelial and stromal proliferation or impaired apoptosis leading to cellular accumulation.
19707263:4	Nevertheless, it is understood that androgens, growth factors, neurotransmitters and other cell interactions play a role in the development of this condition.
19707263:5	While alpha-blockers provide rapid relief in the form of improved flow rate, their effects may not reduce the overall risk of BPH-related complications.
19707263:6	5α-reductase inhibitors were therefore introduced to impact underlying disease by inhibiting the enzyme which converts testosterone to dihydrotesterone (DHT), the primary androgen involved in normal and abnormal prostate growth.
19707263:7	Through this inhibition, prostate size is decreased, thereby reducing the risk of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery while providing symptom control.
19707263:8	As a drug which blocks the type 2 isoenzyme of 5α-reductase, finasteride’s effects on the prostate and symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia have been well documented in the literature.
19707263:9	These effects are most pronounced in men with enlarged prostates (>25 mL) who are at the greatest risk of disease progression.
19707263:10	This article reviews the literature for finasteride used in the treatment of BPH and examines the mode of action of finasteride, its efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and its role in combination therapy and prostate cancer risk.
19707263:11	Mode of action 
Normal and abnormal growth of the prostate is dependent on the presence of hormones and growth factors.
19707263:12	The most important of these is testosterone which is converted within the prostate into its more active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by 5α-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid enzyme localized primarily in the prostatic stromal cell.
19707263:13	This cell plays an important role in androgen-dependent prostatic growth.
19707263:14	Two isoenzymes have been identified, each encoded by a separate gene.
19707263:15	The predominant enzyme in extraprostatic tissue such as the skin or liver is type 1 5α-reductase.
19707263:16	Conversely, the predominant prostatic enzyme is type 2 5α-reductase.
19707263:17	This latter enzyme is critical to normal development of the prostate and hyperplastic growth later in life.
19707263:18	type 2 5α-reductase is extremely sensitive to inhibition by both finasteride as well as dutasteride, a dual type 1, type 2 5α-reductase inhibitor.
19707263:19	Given that several studies have demonstrated identical prostate size reduction between patients treated with finasteride as well as dual type 1, type 2 inhibitors (such as dutasteride), the role of type 1-derived DHT is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
19707263:20	As a competitive inhibitor of type 2 5α-reductase, finasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to DHT, thereby lowering both serum and intraprostatic DHT levels.
19707263:21	A study by Norman and colleagues revealed that finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4%.
19707263:22	However, finasteride does not reduce DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme existing in the skin and liver.
19707263:23	Although the pathophysiology of clinical BPH is not considered to be dependent on prostate size, reducing the prostate’s volume is thought to decrease the constant component of bladder outlet obstruction.
19707263:24	Furthermore, men with a prostate volume of 30 cm 3 or more have been shown to be 3.5 times more likely to have moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms and acute urinary retention.
19707263:25	Therefore, by actively decreasing the size of the prostate through reduction of intraprostatic DHT, finasteride arguably plays an important role in the reduction of long-term risk of progression.
19707263:26	Efficacy 
Tolerability and adverse effects 
Although the efficacy of finasteride in reducing prostate volume and improving peak flow rate and symptom score has been established, particularly for prostate volumes >30 cm 3, this must be weighed against the potential for adverse effects associated with treatment.
19707263:27	However, several trials have demonstrated that finasteride is well tolerated with minimal side effects.
19707263:28	The majority of trials note that the most common side effect is sexual dysfunction and does not constitute a clinically meaningful cause of treatment withdrawal.
19707263:29	, For instance, the North American Finasteride Trial evaluated the withdrawal rate of patients secondary to adverse events.
19707263:30	The most common side effects included decreased libido, ejaculatory disorder, and erectile dysfunction, with rates of 3.4%, 2.7%, and 1.7% in the 5 mg finasteride group.
19707263:31	Despite these adverse effects, the percentage of subjects withdrawing secondary to adverse effects did not differ in the placebo and treatment groups.
19707263:32	Similarly, the International Finasteride Trial confirmed the most common adverse effect was erectile dysfunction (reported in 4.9% in the 5 mg group compared to 0.4% in the placebo group) ( P = 0.001).
19707263:33	No differences were noted in baseline or follow-up endocrine status identified in men with or without erectile dysfunction.
19707263:34	Despite this side effect, only 1 patient out of 246 (0.4%) discontinued the study because of this side effect.
19707263:35	No other adverse clinical effects were noted in the study.
19707263:36	Although the most common side effect for finasteride is sexual dysfunction, the clinical relevance of this finding has recently been called into question.
19707263:37	A recent randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted by Mondaini and colleagues suggests a “nocebo” effect (an adverse side effect that is not a direct result of the pharmacologic action of the drug).
19707263:38	One hundred and twenty patients were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg (concealed identity) either with or without counseling on the drug’s sexual side effects.
19707263:39	Estimation of side effects was determined at 6 and 12 months using the male sexual function-4 (MSF-4) item questionnaire as well as a self-administered questionnaire.
19707263:40	Interestingly, those patients with prior counseling reported a significantly higher proportion of sexual side effects with the incidence of ED, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders of 30.9%, 23.6% and 16.3%, respectively compared to 9.6%, 7.7% and 5.7% in the noncounseled group.
19707263:41	The minimal effect of finasteride on sexual function was further confirmed by the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which is described in further detail later in this review.
19707263:42	Sexual dysfunction was studied in over 17,000 patients during a 7-year period.
19707263:43	A multitude of questionnaires were utilized to assess sexual dysfunction, including Sexual Activity Scale score, SF-36 Mental Health Inventory-5, Physical Function, and Vitality scores and other comorbidities which may be attributable to sexual dysfunction.
19707263:44	Mean sexual dysfunction increased in the finasteride arm from baseline by 2.11 Sexual Activity points at the end of study ( P < 0.001) on a total scale of 0–100.
19707263:45	After adjusting for confounding variables, the absolute magnitude of this dysfunction decreased further.
19707263:46	Although statistically significant, the clinical meaning of such a small change should be taken into account given that a large sample size may show statistical significance with small, clinically insignificant differences.
19707263:47	Other considerations have been made with regard to androgen suppression and its adverse effects.
19707263:48	Because androgens can affect bone turnover, lipids, hematopoiesis, as well as sexual function, Amory and associates set out to determine whether 5α-reductase inhibitors negatively impact these end points.
19707263:49	Conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 99 men between 18 and 55 years old were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg dutasteride, 5 mg finasteride, or placebo for 12 months.
19707263:50	Bone mineral density was measured at baseline, after 1 year and again at 6 months after drug discontinuation.
19707263:51	Serum markers for bone turnover, fasting low-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were measured at baseline, after 26 and 52 weeks of treatment and at 24 weeks after drug discontinuation.
19707263:52	Results revealed no significant difference in placebo and 5α-reductase inhibitors for any of the above mentioned markers with the conclusion that suppression of serum DHT induced by finasteride during 12 months did not adversely affect bone turnover, serum lipoproteins, or hemoglobin.
19707263:53	In addition to physical side effects, animal studies have also described behavioral changes with the use of finasteride, and case reports of finasteride-induced depression have also been reported in humans.
19707263:54	This was formally evaluated by Rahimi-Ardabilli, in which 128 men with androgenic alopecia were prescribed 1 mg finasteride daily.
19707263:55	Study subjects completed both the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before the start of treatment and after two months of use.
19707263:56	Results demonstrated that finasteride-treated patients had significantly increased BDI and HADS depression scores ( P < 0.01).
19707263:57	HADS anxiety scores were increased in the finasteride group, but this was statistically nonsignificant ( P = 0.061).
19707263:58	Although a randomized controlled trial specifically investigating depression and anxiety will be necessary to confirm these findings, one should prescribe finasteride cautiously to patients with a high risk of depression.
19707263:59	Combination therapy 
Role of finasteride for prostate cancer prevention and detection 
Although this review focuses on the role of finasteride in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, we would be remiss to exclude its role in prostate cancer prevention and detection, an important consideration when beginning patients on finasteride therapy.
19707263:60	Because finasteride has been shown to reduce serum PSA, several studies have investigated the extent and clinical impact of this phenomenon.
19707263:61	Many reports have confirmed that finasteride reduces mean serum PSA levels by approximately 50%.
19707263:62	Nevertheless, the effect on PSA is highly variable, and it is therefore considered useful to establish a baseline PSA level prior to initiation of finasteride therapy.
19707263:63	Biopsy for PSA elevation is warranted if the patient is on finasteride therapy, but is ultimately left to the discretion of the clinician.
19707263:64	The PLESS provided additional information regarding the impact of finasteride on detection of prostate cancer.
19707263:65	Three thousand forty men with PSA < 10 ng/mL and no history of prostate cancer were randomized in this study to receive finasteride or placebo for up to 4 years.
19707263:66	A pre-randomization biopsy was performed to confirm a negative status.
19707263:67	Six hundred forty-four patients (21%) underwent biopsy.
19707263:68	The decision to pursue a diagnosis of prostate cancer was left to the discretion of the investigator, providing a more realistic standard practice approach.
19707263:69	The study revealed a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 4.7% of men on finasteride and 5.1% on placebo ( P = 0.7), suggesting that finasteride does not mask the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
19707263:70	Furthermore, elevated PSA prompted diagnosis in 35% of cases on finasteride and 34% on placebo using an upper PSA limit of 2.0 ng/mL for finasteride and 4.0 ng/mL for placebo, yielding similar sensitivity, higher specificity, and a higher likelihood ratio for finasteride when compared to placebo.
19707263:71	The authors conclude that multiplication of the PSA by 2 and using normal ranges for untreated men seemed to preserve the usefulness of PSA in prostate cancer detection in men taking finasteride.
19707263:72	The largest study investigating prostate cancer prevention with finasteride was published by Thompson and coworkers in 2003.
19707263:73	Aptly named the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, the study randomized 18,882 men ≥55 years old with a normal DRE and PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL to treatment with 5 mg of finasteride or placebo for 7 years.
19707263:74	Prostate biopsies were obtained if the annual PSA (adjusted for effect of finasteride) exceeded 4.0 ng/mL or if the DRE was felt to be abnormal.
19707263:75	Primary end point was prevalence of prostate cancer.
19707263:76	This outcome was detected in 803 (18.4%) in the finasteride group and 1147 (24.4%) in the placebo group, indicating a 24.8% risk reduction in prevalence over seven years (p < 0.001).
19707263:77	However, an alarming increase in high-grade 7 or above tumors were found in the finasteride group (37%) versus the placebo group (22%) ( P < 0.001).
19707263:78	Because of this anxiety-provoking finding of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, subsequent analyses were performed which found that finasteride biases toward improved detection of prostate cancer as well as increased accuracy in prostate cancer grading at biopsy. Lucia and colleagues assessed whether the increased high-grade prostate cancer associated with finasteride in the PCPT was due to finasteride’s potential effects on tumor morphology or prostate size.
19707263:79	Prostate biopsies with Gleason scores 7–10 were examined.
19707263:80	When possible, comparisons were made between these biopsies and sample from radical prostatectomies, examining for tumor grade and extent.
19707263:81	Among patients undergoing prostatectomy, the finasteride-associated increase in high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy was decreased at prostatectomy (46% finasteride versus 39% placebo, P = 0.10), suggesting that finasteride’s effects on prostate volume was more likely the contributing factor for the increase in high-grade cancers in this treatment group.
19707263:82	Another analysis accounted for these biases by estimating the effect of finasteride on the risk of overall and high-grade prostate cancer.
19707263:83	Using estimated rates of high-grade prostate cancer based on analysis incorporating grading information from radical prostatectomies in 500 subjects, the resulting estimates for high-grade cancer rates were 8.2% versus 6.0% for placebo and finasteride, respectively demonstrating a statistically significant 27% risk reduction with finasteride ( P = 0.02).
19707263:84	Furthermore, a second analysis included 3-month longer collection of endpoints from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), revealing bias-adjusted prostate cancer rates of 21.1% (4.2% high-grade) in the placebo group versus 14.7% (4.8% high-grade) in the finasteride group, demonstrating a non-significant difference in high-grade cancers between the two groups ( P = 0.12).
19707263:85	These findings collectively propose caution in concluding that finasteride increases the risk of high grade prostate cancer.
19707263:86	Lucia and colleagues also addressed the concern that early detection by PSA and prevention by finasteride may involve biologically inconsequential tumors.
19707263:87	Tumor pathology was stratified by level of PSA for men in the placebo group who underwent radical prostatectomy.
19707263:88	Study findings demonstrated that low cutoff levels increase detection of insignificant disease but provides more likelihood for cure whereas higher cutoff levels demonstrate the opposite.
19707263:89	Their recommendation was therefore to taylor cutoff values for PSA screening in those with finasteride, providing men with the information that finasteride may possibly decrease their risk of disease.
19707263:90	A Cochrane Database Systematic Review was published in April of 2008 and succinctly outlines conclusions from the PCPT.
19707263:91	All randomized controlled trials published after 1984 of at least 1 year duration were included in the review.
19707263:92	Based on this review, the AUA recently released guidelines which address the role of finasteride in prostate cancer prevention.
19707263:93	Asymptomatic men with PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL should be notified that finasteride may reduce the incidence of prostate cancer with an additional discussion of the elevated rate of high-grade cancer with potential explanations for this potential risk.
19707263:94	Furthermore, these patients should be informed that no information is known beyond seven years (as this was the duration of the largest trial [the PCPT]) and information regarding the reduction of prostate cancer mortality is unknown.
19707263:95	Cost 
Because medical therapy for BPH may be necessary for many years, the cost effectiveness of this therapy compared to other modalities such as other pharmacologic agents as well as surgical options is an important consideration.
19707263:96	While this has been informally discussed in several randomized controlled clinical trials, formal evaluation in the literature is limited.
19707263:97	Johansen and colleagues investigated the cost effectiveness of multiple management options for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates >30 cm 3, including finasteride, dutasteride, tamsulosin and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).
19707263:98	Using a Markov model, the clinical progression of BPH in a cohort of 1000 men was estimated over 4- and 15.5-year periods in the Norwegian health system.
19707263:99	Transitions between BPH symptoms, acute urinary retention, TURP, prostate cancer and death were estimated from the published literature, and sensitivity analyses were performed for direct and indirect costs for patients treated with dutasteride, finasteride, tamsulosin or TURP.
19707263:100	Total costs for each of these treatment options at 15.5 years were 3,924, 4,539, 4,946, and 6,164, respectively.
19707263:101	The relative order of these costs was similar at 4 years.
19707263:102	With these findings, dutasteride was found to be the most cost-effective, followed by finasteride and finally tamsulosin and TURP.
19707263:103	An abstract published by Lafuma and colleagues estimated the cost-efficacy of finasteride, doxazosin, and their combination in the treatment of BPH in France.
19707263:104	Using data compiled from the MTOPS study, cost records were extracted from the National Health Insurance website and costs were determined to be 7,404 for finasteride, 7,314 for doxazosin and 8,206 for the combination.
19707263:105	Cost-efficacy ratios were determined (additional drug costs per invasive therapy avoided) and found to be similar for finasteride and doxazosin and slightly higher for those with combination therapy.
19707263:106	The investigators therefore concluded that the cost-efficacy ratio of finasteride alone or in combination with doxazosin remained in the acceptable range.
19707263:107	Although these studies are based on international health care cost models, the MTOPS study does provide objective evidence that combination therapy may be the most cost effective approach.
19707263:108	Results from the study indicate that the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent a case of BPH progression was 13.7 and 15.0 for the doxazosin- and finasteride-monotherapy patients but only 8.4 for the combination therapy group.
19707263:109	The NNT was decreased further to 4.7 and 4.9 when analyzing those patients with a baseline PSA > 4.0 ng/mL and prostate size >40 cm 3, respectively, suggesting that combination therapy becomes a more cost-effective approach for men with enlarged prostates in any health care model.
19707263:110	Finally, cost-effectiveness for finasteride as a method of prostate cancer chemoprevention has recently been evaluated.
19707263:111	Based upon data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, Svatek and associates used a Markov decision analysis model to determine lifetime prostate health-related costs (beginning at age 50) for men treated with finasteride versus placebo.
19707263:112	Results revealed a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$122,747 per quality-adjusted life-years saved (adjusted for US$112,062 if one assumes that finasteride does not increase the incidence of high-grade tumors).
19707263:113	However, the cost-effectiveness ratio could be less than US$50,000 per quality of life years saved when applied to a high-risk population with cost of US$30 per month.
19707263:114	Therefore, the conclusion was made that finasteride is unlikely to be cost-effective when considering impact of survival differences among treated and untreated men but potentially cost-effective in high risk populations when taking into consideration the impact of quality of life.
19707263:115	Conclusion 
Numerous multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have supported the role of finasteride in the treatment of BPH.
19707263:116	As monotherapy, it has been found to significantly reduce prostate volume by over 20% with additional overall treatment-related improvements in symptom score and peak flow rate.
19707263:117	As an added benefit, finasteride has proven efficacious in the management of refractory hematuria secondary to BPH and in preparation for TURP.
19707263:118	Several studies have additionally investigated its role in combination therapy, and while short-term studies did not report a significant benefit, one long-term study revealed significant advantages with combination therapy with alpha-blockers to prevent BPH progression events such as acute urinary retention and need for BPH-related surgery.
19707263:119	Treatment with finasteride has also been shown to reduce prostate cancer while maintaining the rate of detection, and patients should be informed of this fact while also indicating its possible (but unlikely) link to high grade prostate cancer and its unknown effect on prostate cancer mortality.
19707263:120	Long-term safety and durability have been demonstrated in several studies with the most common adverse clinical effect related to sexual dysfunction.
19707263:121	Cost models have investigated its effectiveness and found it a cost effective measure for treatment, especially for patients with moderate/severe symptoms and enlarged prostate >30 cm 3 when compared to TURP and tamsulosin.
19707263:122	In conclusion, finasteride represents a cost-effective means of reducing BPH progression and its complications in men with enlarged prostates >30 cm 3 while providing the additional benefits of decreased hematuria and prostate cancer rates.
19772565:0	Background 
It is well acknowledged that characteristics of biochemical systems, such as oscillatory behavior, are preserved under significantly different environmental conditions, i.e., the systems are robust.
19772565:1	Some biological systems have been experimentally proven to be robust [ - ].
19772565:2	Since biological systems are robust, the mathematical models developed to represent their characteristics must also reflect this property.
19772565:3	In addition, since it is not possible to precisely determine the parameters in the modeling process, biochemical system models must maintain basic properties, such as oscillatory behavior, in the presence of parameter perturbations . Therefore, robustness is considered as an important measure of the validity of mathematical models.
19772565:4	Determining the robustness of the oscillatory behavior of a bio-molecular model has also relevance in design problems.
19772565:5	In fact, by determining the region in parameter space where oscillations persist, one can provide guidelines (see  for example) for designing the components of synthetic oscillators such as those of . 
Parametric robustness of biochemical oscillator networks has been the subject of several studies . In these studies, the maximum allowable parameter deviation from nominal values under which the system oscillations persist is considered as a metric for measuring model robustness.
19772565:6	Alternative definitions of parametric robustness are proposed in which the sensitivity of the system equilibrium to parameter variation is considered as a measure of robustness .
19772565:7	This measure, however, is only applicable to non-oscillatory systems.
19772565:8	Bifurcation analysis is employed to study the sensitivity of oscillatory behavior to variations of a single parameter [ - ].
19772565:9	Systems whose robustness to one-parameter-at-a-time variation is established may be sensitive to simultaneous variation of parameters.
19772565:10	Unfortunately, analysis of the effect of multiparameter variation on the oscillatory behavior of a system is more computationally demanding compared to one-parameter-at-a-time variation.
19772565:11	In particular, systematic variation of multiple parameters suffers from exponential increase in the number of combinations of parameters to be considered.
19772565:12	Therefore, multiparametric sensitivity has often been addressed via computer simulations based on Monte Carlo methods .
19772565:13	Since this method relies on random variation of all parameters, the resulting robustness evaluation is inconclusive.
19772565:14	Structured Singular Value (SSV) analysis ( μ -analysis), a tool developed in the field of robust control, has been employed to provide information on the robustness of systems in the presence of multiple and simultaneous parameter variations from nominal values . In this analysis, a parameter called μ is calculated whose inverse determines the maximum allowed parameter variation beyond which the system is destabilized.
19772565:15	For oscillatory biochemical networks, destabilization means that the system ceases to oscillate.
19772565:16	The advantage of μ -analysis over Monte Carlo methods is that, due to its deterministic nature, it can compute the extent of parameter uncertainty for which the model is guaranteed to produce the desired behavior.
19772565:17	However, for systems with many parameters, μ -analysis is not computationally feasible.
19772565:18	Hence, one can only rely on computing upper and lower bounds for μ which determine the maximum stabilizing parameter variation and the minimum destabilizing parameter variation, respectively.
19772565:19	To determine whether a system is robust, the lower bound of μ must be calculated.
19772565:20	However, available algorithms for computing this lower bound suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., computational time grows exponentially with the number of parameters . Another drawback of μ -analysis is that it relies on the linearization of the system about the nominal oscillatory trajectory.
19772565:21	As a consequence, a specific combination of parameter variations may destabilize the linearized system while still leading to sustained oscillations in the nonlinear system.
19772565:22	This is highly likely in biochemical networks as stable periodic solutions often arise due to nonlinear dynamics.
19772565:23	In addition to μ -analysis, analysis of robustness of systems to multiparameter variations has been approached by searching the worst case combination of parameter variations that suppresses oscillations.
19772565:24	In , the integral of the square of the derivative of one of the states, considered as a measure of the occurrence of oscillations, is minimized with respect to parameter variations employing Hybrid Genetic Algorithms (HGA) .
19772565:25	This optimization is performed to determine the region in the parameter space where oscillations persist.
19772565:26	Since this method is based on exhaustive simulation, it cannot be applied for systems with large numbers of states and parameters due to the associated prohibitive computational cost.
19772565:27	In this paper, we introduce a novel robustness analysis method for oscillatory behavior based on the combination of Hopf bifurcation  and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion . Combining these two techniques, we compute a scalar parameter ℛ (encompassing all system parameters), which is solely responsible of Hopf bifurcation.
19772565:28	As a consequence, we study the persistence of the periodic orbit as this single parameter ℛ is varied.
19772565:29	This dramatically reduces the complexity of the problem while retaining the desirable features of multiparameter variation.
19772565:30	To translate the maximal variation of ℛ that preserves oscillatory behavior to the maximal variation from a nominal parameter in the original parameter space, we solve an optimization problem.
19772565:31	The so obtained maximum parameter variation determines the largest box in parameter space about the nominal parameter values in which the model displays sustained oscillations.
19772565:32	Under the assumption that the terms of order higher than three in the Taylor expansion of the system on the center manifold are negligible in the found box, this box provides a tight estimate of the robustness of the system.
19772565:33	We illustrate the application of our approach to models of two molecular networks.
19772565:34	The first model describes the molecular network underling adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) oscillations observed in populations of Dictyostelium cells, proposed by Laub and Loomis in .
19772565:35	The second model describes the metabolism of an activated neutrophil granulocyte . 
We next describe the details of the method proposed in this paper.
19772565:36	Methods 
In this section, we propose a robustness analysis technique based on the combination of Hopf bifurcation  and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion . Consider a model of a biochemical network given as 

in which x ( t ) ∈ ℝ n is a vector whose elements are concentrations of chemical species and K ∈ ℝ p is a vector of parameters.
19772565:37	Let K 0 ∈ ℝ p be a nominal parameter vector for which system (1) displays a stable periodic orbit.
19772565:38	We seek to determine the maximal allowed variation of the parameters K from the nominal value K 0 before the stable periodic solution disappears.
19772565:39	We tackle this problem by analytically computing the set of all values of K at which system (1) admits a Hopf bifurcation.
19772565:40	We then compute the largest box in parameter space about K 0 that does not include any of the values of K at which the system admits a Hopf bifurcation.
19772565:41	Under suitable assumptions, this box is the largest box about K 0 in which sustained oscillations are preserved.
19772565:42	This is explained in more detail in the following section.
19772565:43	Results 
In this section, we illustrate the detailed application of Algorithm 1 to two well known models of oscillatory biochemical networks and compare the results with robustness measures previously obtained in the literature.
19772565:44	Discussion 
The method introduced in this paper relies on the computation of ℛ, that is, the scalar function of system parameters whose sign determines the existence of the stable periodic orbit.
19772565:45	The robustness of the periodic orbit of a system can be evaluated by determining the deviation δ * from the nominal parameter values at which the function ℛ changes sign.
19772565:46	This deviation can be numerically computed by employing standard optimization techniques such as SQP and HGA.
19772565:47	As a consequence, this technique is computationally lighter than multiparameter robustness analysis based on random-search methods, in which the system is simulated at each point in parameter space.
19772565:48	Nevertheless, since ℛ encompasses all system parameters, this method retains the desirable features of multiparameter robustness analysis.
19772565:49	Moreover, the proposed method provides more accurate robustness measures when compared to methods based on the linear approximation of the system about the nominal periodic orbit, as it is shown in the first application example.
19772565:50	The proposed method relies on Hopf bifurcation theorem and on the assumption that ℛ( K ) is sufficiently small for K inside the box B δ * ( K 0). This guarantees that the terms of order higher than three in the Taylor expansion of the system on the center manifold about and x e are negligible in the box B δ * ( K 0). To provide evidence that this assumption is satisfied, we vary ℛ from its minimum to its maximum in the box B δ * ( K 0) and verify via simulation that the periodic orbit persists.
19772565:51	This simulation step does not present computational limitations.
19772565:52	It is in fact performed as one scalar parameter (ℛ) is varied as opposed to varying multiple parameters at once as in multiparameter robustness analysis.
19772565:53	The underlying assumption for the approach presented in this paper to provide a tight bound on the robustness of the system is that the nominal periodic orbit of the system originates from a Hopf bifurcation.
19772565:54	If this were not the case, the provided bound would not necessarily be meaningful as other types of bifurcations may be responsible of the birth and death of the periodic orbit.
19772565:55	Therefore, the approach of this paper is generally applicable and restricted to those natural oscillatory systems exhibiting Hopf bifurcation.
19772565:56	For the Laub and Loomis model, previous work employing HGA, in which the system is simulated at each point in parameter space, the robustness of the system was determined as 0.6% . Employing the method proposed in this paper, the robustness of the system has been determined as δ * = 0.51%.
19772565:57	This bound is tight, as the system ceases to oscillate at a combination of parameters that is away from the nominal value K 0 only slightly more than δ *.
19772565:58	This bound is therefore tighter than the one found employing μ analysis or global/hybrid optimization methods.
19772565:59	For the model of the oscillatory metabolism of activated neutrophils, previous work only performed one-parameter-at-a-time variation . According to this single parameter variation analysis, the minimum deviation from nominal values of parameters which causes the periodic orbit to disappear is 16.67%.
19772565:60	By contrast, employing the method proposed in this paper, the robustness of the system has been quantified as δ * = 5.91%.
19772565:61	This bound is tight as a combination of parameters that is away from the nominal point K 0 slightly more than δ * has been determined at which the system ceases to oscillate.
19772565:62	This result shows that the oscillatory behavior of this model is not as robust with respect to parameter variation as it was perceived.
19772565:63	Conclusion 
The robustness analysis of bio-molecular systems is an important problem in systems and synthetic biology.
19772565:64	Previously, the robustness of a system with respect to parameter variations has been investigated by employing μ analysis on the linearized system about nominal periodic orbit or by applying HGA, in which the system is simulated for each combination of parameter values.
19772565:65	In this paper, a method based on the combined application of Hopf bifurcation and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion is introduced.
19772565:66	We computed a scalar function of all system parameters whose sign determines the existence of a stable periodic orbit.
19772565:67	This method is applied to two bio-molecular systems: the Laub and Loomis model and the model of the oscillatory metabolism of activated neutrophils.
19772565:68	The maximum allowed parameter variation with respect to nominal values under which the system preserves oscillatory behavior is calculated.
19772565:69	For the Laub and Loomis model, the computed maximum allowed variation is tighter than what was obtained with previous multiparametric analysis methods.
19772565:70	For the model of activated neutrophils, only single parameter variations were considered in the literature to evaluate parametric robustness.
19772565:71	Employing the method proposed in this paper, we evaluate the robustness of the system to be about one third of the one estimated in the literature employing single parameter variations.

21562755:0	Introduction 
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the cornerstone in the treatment of numerous chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis , polymyalgia rheumatica  and giant cell arteritis , systemic lupus erythematosus  and inflammatory bowel diseases . GC treatment is accompanied by significant metabolic adverse effects, including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and diabetes, visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia and skeletal muscle atrophy . The development of these adverse metabolic effects is dependent on the administered dose , and has mainly been studied with high doses.
21562755:1	As such, daily administration of 36 mg prednisolone equivalent impaired glucose tolerance by reducing hepatic  and peripheral insulin sensitivity . Furthermore, 30 mg prednisolone daily stimulated adipose tissue, but not whole-body, lipolysis , and induced dyslipidaemia . In addition, 60 mg prednisolone daily was shown to stimulate breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue .
21562755:2	Finally, chronic exposure to markedly increased endogenous GC levels, as shown in patients with Cushing’s syndrome, unfavourably affected body fat distribution by promoting visceral fat accumulation and hepatic steatosis .
21562755:3	However, most patients treated with GCs for prolonged time periods receive, following an induction dose, GC dosages in the lower range: ≤7.5 mg prednisolone equivalent daily.
21562755:4	Although the efficacy of these doses on disease activity in various conditions is well established  , the extent to which these low dosages induce adverse metabolic effects is unclear.
21562755:5	In large retrospective case–control studies, it was demonstrated that low-dose GC treatment increased the odds for the initiation of blood-glucose lowering therapy by 63%  and increased the risk of developing diabetes . In contrast, in clinical trials with chronic use of low-dose GC treatment, incident diabetes is reported less frequently .
21562755:6	The main limitation of these data is that no distinction can be made between disease-induced and age-related abnormalities on the one hand, and the metabolic abnormalities induced by low-dose prednisolone treatment on the other.
21562755:7	To date, no studies have assessed the effects of low-dose GC treatment on the three most important pathways of intermediary metabolism.
21562755:8	In addition, previous studies addressing the metabolic adverse effects of GC treatment have only studied the (hyper)acute effects and typically administered a single dose.
21562755:9	Thus, in the present study, we studied the effects of 2 week low-dose prednisolone treatment (7.5 mg daily) on glucose, lipid and protein metabolism using stable isotopes in healthy men, and included a typical induction dosage of prednisolone (i.e. 30 mg daily), which is known to impair intermediary metabolism, and a matching placebo treatment.
21562755:10	Through combined infusion of tracers for glucose and protein metabolism, as well as lipolysis, we assessed differences in the sensitivity of metabolic fluxes to the dose-dependent effects of GC treatment.
21562755:11	Methods 
Participants Thirty-two healthy white men were recruited via local advertisements.
21562755:12	All participants were in good health as confirmed by medical history, physical examination, screening blood tests and a 75 g 2 h OGTT, performed at screening visit.
21562755:13	Inclusion criteria included: age 18–35 years; BMI 20–25 kg/m 2; and normoglycaemia as defined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 5.6
21562755:14	mmol/l and 2 h glucose < 7.8 mmol/l during OGTT.
21562755:15	Exclusion criteria were the presence of any disease, use of any medication, first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes, smoking, shift work, a history of GC use, excessive sport activities (i.e. more often than twice/week) and changes in weight in the 3 months prior to study participation.
21562755:16	The study was approved by an independent ethics committee and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
21562755:17	All participants provided written informed consent before participation.
21562755:18	Study design The study was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled dose-response intervention study.
21562755:19	Following assessment of eligibility and baseline measurements, participants were randomised to receive either prednisolone 7.5 mg once daily ( n  = 12), prednisolone 30 mg once daily ( n  = 12), or placebo ( n  = 8) treatment for a period of 14 days using block randomisation, as carried out by the department of experimental pharmacology of the VU University Medical Centre.
21562755:20	On day −2 and day 13 of treatment, body composition, body fat distribution and liver fat content were quantified.
21562755:21	On day −1 and on day 14 of treatment, glucose kinetics, lipolysis and proteolysis were measured in the basal state and during a two-step hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp using stable isotopes (electronic supplementary material [ESM] Fig.
21562755:22	a, b).
21562755:23	All measurements were conducted following a 12 h overnight fast with the individuals in the semi-supine position.
21562755:24	Participants refrained from drinking alcohol for a period of 24 h before the study days and did not perform strenuous exercise for a period of 48 h before the study days.
21562755:25	During all visits, including a follow-up visit at day 7 of treatment, safety and tolerability were assessed.
21562755:26	A patient flow diagram is shown in ESM Fig.
21562755:27	. 
Assessment of body composition/body fat distribution Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans (Delphi A; Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA).
21562755:28	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for determination of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area at the level of L3-L4, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS), to quantify liver fat content, were performed using a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Sonata; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), as described previously by Tushuizen et al. . All magnetic resonance examinations (DVR) and quantification of abdominal fat compartments (MHM) were done by a single experienced investigator.
21562755:29	Clamp After an overnight fast of 12 h, participants were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at 07:30 hours.
21562755:30	An indwelling cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of stable-isotope tracers, glucose and insulin.
21562755:31	To obtain arterialised venous blood samples, a retrograde cannula was inserted in a contralateral wrist vein and maintained in a thermoregulated box at 50°C.
21562755:32	To keep the sampling line patent 0.9% NaCl was infused.
21562755:33	[6,6- 2H 2]Glucose, [1,1,2,3,3- 2H 5]glycerol and L-[1- 13C]valine were used as tracers (>99% enriched; Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA, USA) to study glucose kinetics, lipolysis and valine turnover respectively.
21562755:34	At t  = 0 h (08:00 hours), blood samples were drawn for determination of background enrichments.
21562755:35	Then, a primed continuous infusion of isotopes was started: [6,6- 2H 2]glucose (prime: 11 μmol/kg; continuous: 0.11 μmol kg −1 min −1), [1,1,2,3,3- 2H 5]glycerol (prime: 1.6 μmol/kg; continuous: 0.11 μmol kg -1 min -1), and L-[1- 13C]valine (prime: 13.7 μmol/kg; continuous: 0.153 μmol kg −1 min −1) and continued until the end of the clamp.
21562755:36	After a 2 h equilibrium period (14 h of fasting), three blood samples were drawn for determination of basal glucose concentrations, isotope enrichment, and levels of glucoregulatory hormones and NEFA.
21562755:37	Thereafter, a two-step hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp was started: step 1 included an infusion of insulin at a rate of 20 mU m −2 min −1 (Actrapid 100 U/ml; Novo Nordisk, Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands) to assess hepatic insulin sensitivity.
21562755:38	Glucose 20% was started to maintain a plasma glucose concentration of 5 mmol/l.
21562755:39	[6,6- 2H 2]Glucose was added to the glucose solution to achieve glucose enrichments of 1% in order to approximate the values for enrichment reached in plasma and thereby minimising changes in isotopic enrichment due to changes in the infusion rate of exogenous glucose.
21562755:40	Plasma glucose concentrations were measured every 5 min at bedside.
21562755:41	After 2 h of insulin infusion, five blood samples were drawn at 5 min intervals for the measurement of glucose concentrations and isotopic enrichments.
21562755:42	Another blood sample was drawn for measurement of glucoregulatory hormones and NEFA.
21562755:43	Hereafter, insulin infusion was increased to a rate of 60 mU m −2 min −1 (step 2) to assess peripheral insulin sensitivity.
21562755:44	After 2 h of insulin infusion, blood sampling for glucose, isotope enrichments, glucoregulatory hormones and NEFA was repeated (ESM Fig.
21562755:45	b).
21562755:46	Indirect calorimetry Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured continuously during the final 20 min of both the basal state and during step 2 of the hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system (Vmax model 2900; Sensormedics, Anaheim, CA, USA).
21562755:47	The and measurements during the last 10 min were used for further calculations.
21562755:48	Study medication Prednisolone tablets were purchased from Pfizer (Sollentuna, Sweden) and matching placebo tablets were obtained from Xendo Drug Development (Groningen, the Netherlands).
21562755:49	The tablets were encapsulated in order to allow the treatment to be blinded, as described previously . Study medication was taken at 08:00 hours during the 2 week treatment except on days 13 and 14, when it was ingested at 06:00 hours.
21562755:50	Patients kept a diary in which the exact time of medication intake during the study was registered.
21562755:51	Glucose, lipid, and valine measurements Plasma glucose concentrations were measured with the glucose oxidase method using a Biosen C-line Plus glucose analyser (EKF Diagnostics, Barleben/Magdeburg, Germany).
21562755:52	Plasma NEFA concentrations were measured with an enzymatic colorimetric method (NEFA-C test kit; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) with an intra-assay variation of 1%, inter-assay variation of 4–15% and a detection limit of 0.02 mmol/l.
21562755:53	[6,6- 2H 2]Glucose, [1,1,2,3,3,- 2H 5]glycerol and L-[1- 13C]valine enrichment were measured with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry as described previously  . Briefly, temperature-programmed gas chromatography with split injection (Model 6890; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) was coupled to a mass selective detector (model 5973 Agilent Technologies) in the electron impact ionisation mode for glucose and valine analysis and in the positive chemical ionisation mode for glycerol.
21562755:54	Exact gas chromatography and mass spectometry variables are given in Ackermans et al., Ackermans et al. and Geukers et al.  . 
Glucoregulatory hormones Insulin was determined on an Immulite 2000 system (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA) with a chemiluminescent immunometric assay, intra-assay variation of 3–6%, an inter-assay variation of 4–6% and a detection limit of 15 pmol/l.
21562755:55	Glucagon was determined with the Linco 125I radioimmunoassay (St Charles, MO, USA) with an intra-assay variation of 9–10%, an inter-assay variation of 5–7% and a detection limit of 15 ng/l.
21562755:56	Calculations Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and the peripheral uptake of glucose (rate of disappearance, R d) were calculated using modified versions of the Steele equations for the non-steady state and were expressed as μmol kg −1 min −1 as described previously . Lipolysis (glycerol turnover) and proteolysis (valine turnover) were computed using formulae for steady state kinetics adapted for stable isotopes  and were expressed as μmol kg −1 min −1.
21562755:57	The equations are provided in ESM Fig.
21562755:58	. The abbreviated Weir equation was used to calculate the 24 h energy expenditure.
21562755:59	Glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation rates were derived from oxygen consumption and carbon oxide production as reported previously . Glucose oxidation during insulin infusion was additionally expressed as percentage of glucose R d. 
Statistics Data are presented as mean values ± SD, or as median (interquartile range) in case of skewed distribution.
21562755:60	Absolute changes from baseline (on treatment value − pre-treatment value) were compared between the groups using the Kruskal–Wallis test.
21562755:61	Non-parametric analysis was chosen because of the relatively small number of participants and the uneven group sizes.
21562755:62	Only in the case of a significant finding were prednisolone 7.5 mg and prednisolone 30 mg compared against placebo by post hoc testing, using the Mann–Whitney U test.
21562755:63	To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni correction was applied by multiplying the obtained p value from the Mann–Whitney U test by the numbers of comparisons (i.e. two) that were carried out.
21562755:64	All statistical analyses were run on SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
21562755:65	A p  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
21562755:66	Results 
Anthropometric characteristics The participant characteristics at inclusion are presented in Table  ; no differences were observed among the three treatment groups at baseline.
21562755:67	BMI, lean body mass (LBM) and total fat mass were not altered by prednisolone treatment irrespective of the dose (ESM Table  ).
21562755:68	Liver fat content averaged 1.3 ± 0.9% before treatment in all participants and was not changed by either study medication (ESM Table  ).
21562755:69	VAT and SAT areas averaged 74 ± 19 and 136 ± 38 cm 2, respectively, at baseline in all participants, and were not altered by treatment with either prednisolone dose (ESM Table  ).
21562755:70	Resting energy expenditure Resting energy expenditure (REE) in the basal state was 100 ± 11 kJ kg −1 day −1 prior to treatment and was not changed by either prednisolone dose (Table  ).
21562755:71	Insulin infusion increased REE before treatment to 106 ± 9 kJ kg −1 day −1 ( p  < 0.01), an effect that was not changed by prednisolone treatment (Table  ).
21562755:72	Glucose metabolism Prednisolone treatment dose dependently and significantly increased FPG, despite fasting hyperinsulinaemia in the prednisolone 30 mg group (Table  ).
21562755:73	Fasting EGP was only increased by prednisolone 30 mg (Fig.  ), whereas suppression of EGP by insulin was impaired by both prednisolone doses (Fig.  ).
21562755:74	Peripheral glucose disposal was significantly decreased by prednisolone 30 mg, but not by prednisolone 7.5 mg (Fig.  ).
21562755:75	In the total study population, at baseline, glucose oxidation in the basal state was 5.8 (3.1–8.2) μmol kg −1 min −1, which was significantly increased during treatment with prednisolone 30 mg, but not with prednisolone 7.5 mg (Table  ).
21562755:76	Pre-treatment, glucose oxidation increased to 20.0 (18.3–23.7) 
21562755:77	μmol kg −1 min −1 (9 ± 5% of R d) during hyperinsulinaemia ( p  < 0.001 compared with the basal state).
21562755:78	Prednisolone treatment did not affect the absolute levels of glucose oxidation during hyperinsulinaemia; however, prednisolone 30 mg increased glucose oxidation relative to R d (Table  ).
21562755:79	Lipid metabolism Lipolysis in the fasted state tended to be decreased by prednisolone treatment ( p  = 0.062), which was driven by the prednisolone 30 mg arm ( p  = 0.09) (Fig.  ).
21562755:80	Insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis was markedly and dose dependently impaired by prednisolone during hyperinsulinaemic conditions (Fig.  ).
21562755:81	Similarly to changes in lipolysis, basal NEFA levels were decreased prednisolone treatment, which seemed to be driven by prednisolone 30 mg (Table  ).
21562755:82	During step 1 of insulin infusion (20 mU m −2 min −1), insulin-mediated suppression of plasma NEFA levels was dose dependently decreased by prednisolone treatment (ESM Table  ).
21562755:83	During the second step of insulin infusion (60 mU m −2 min −1), NEFA levels were reduced to detection level in the placebo group and prednisolone 7.5 mg group, but remained detectable in participants in the prednisolone 30 mg arm (ESM Table  ).
21562755:84	Fasting triacylglycerol (TG) levels were increased by prednisolone 30 mg only (Table  ).
21562755:85	In the total study population, pre-treatment, fasting fatty acid oxidation rate was 1.5 (1.3–1.8) μmol kg −1 min −1 and decreased during insulin infusion to 0.4 (0.2–0.7) μmol kg −1 min −1 ( p  < 0.001).
21562755:86	Basal fatty acid oxidation was reduced by prednisolone 30 mg treatment, but fatty acid oxidation during insulin infusion was not affected by any of the treatment arms (Table  ).
21562755:87	Protein metabolism Prednisolone treatment did not affect proteolysis in the fasted state (Fig.  ); however, prednisolone treatment increased proteolysis under hyperinsulinaemic conditions (Fig.  ).
21562755:88	Glucoregulatory hormones Prednisolone 7.5 mg did not change fasting plasma insulin levels or glucagon levels.
21562755:89	Prednisolone 30 mg, in contrast, induced both fasting hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglucagonaemia (Table  ).
21562755:90	Before treatment, insulin levels in the entire study population during the clamp were 171 (153–183) pmol/l (step 1) and 533 (485–564) pmol/l (step 2).
21562755:91	These levels remained unchanged during the on-treatment clamps, although there was a tendency towards increased insulin levels in the placebo group (ESM Table  ).
21562755:92	Glucagon levels remained increased during step 1, but not step 2, of the hyperinsulinaemic clamp during prednisolone 30 mg treatment (ESM Table  ).
21562755:93	Safety and tolerability One participant in the prednisolone 30 mg group complained of gastric discomfort which was mild of nature and did not require any intervention.
21562755:94	Otherwise, no treatment-related side effects were reported in either group.
21562755:95	Discussion 
Low-dose GC treatment is chronically prescribed to a great number of patients, but to date it is uncertain whether low-dose GC treatment induces adverse metabolic effects, as is evident for higher GC doses.
21562755:96	The present study is the first to demonstrate that low-dose GC therapy, that is, just above the normal daily cortisol replacement dose for adrenal insufficiency, significantly impairs the effects of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolism, but not on whole-body protein metabolism.
21562755:97	Using a relatively long exposure time, i.e. 2 weeks, we report that treatment with prednisolone 7.5 mg impaired the ability of insulin to suppress EGP, whole-body lipolysis and plasma NEFA levels.
21562755:98	These effects were present after only 2 weeks of treatment and occurred in the absence of changes in body weight, LBM, liver fat content and body fat distribution.
21562755:99	Our data, demonstrating clear low-dose prednisolone-induced hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance, provide supportive mechanisms for observations made in large retrospective case–control studies that reported increased risk to develop diabetes  and increased need to initiate blood-glucose lowering therapy  during or following low-dose GC therapy.
21562755:100	In prospective studies, the reported incidence of diabetes at lower GC doses has been more modest, although there was considerable variation depending on the patient group exposed .
21562755:101	The numbers reported in these clinical trials may underestimate the actual incidence of diabetes.
21562755:102	Although not well specified in the different studies, most studies relied on fasting glucose measurements to monitor changes in glucose tolerance.
21562755:103	Our data demonstrate a very mild increase in fasting glucose and unchanged fasting insulin levels, but show evident changes induced by prednisolone 7.5 mg in metabolic fluxes under insulin-stimulated conditions.
21562755:104	This observation is in line with previous studies reporting large postprandial glucose excursions with only modest changes in fasting glucose levels . These data imply that, in order to properly assess the effects of GCs on glucose metabolism, measurements under stimulated conditions should be performed, such as an OGTT or a glucose day curve.
21562755:105	By including an additional treatment arm, we were able to study the dose-dependent effects of prednisolone treatment.
21562755:106	Prednisolone 30 mg, an induction dosage often used in the clinic for short-term treatment, impaired the effects of insulin on EGP, glucose disposal and lipolysis to a greater extent than prednisolone 7.5 mg.
21562755:107	In addition, prednisolone 30 mg increased proteolysis under hyperinsulinaemic conditions, increased glucagon levels and augmented fasting TG levels.
21562755:108	Surprisingly, prednisolone 30 mg increased both basal glucose oxidation (absolute levels) and glucose oxidation during the clamp (expressed as % of R d). Increased basal glucose oxidation has, to our knowledge, not been reported previously following GC treatment.
21562755:109	We hypothesise that prednisolone treatment induced metabolic inflexibility.
21562755:110	This phenomenon refers to the inability to adjust fuel oxidation to substrate availability.
21562755:111	As such, impaired fat oxidation in the fasted state was extensively shown in obese insulin-resistant and type 2 diabetic individuals . In addition, following high-dose prednisolone treatment, FPG levels were, albeit it marginally, increased, which could have contributed to augmented glucose oxidation in the basal state.
21562755:112	The finding that GC treatment increased glucose oxidation under hyperinsulinaemic conditions has been reported previously in non-diabetic individuals who were exposed to dexamethasone treatment . GCs are well known to impair the insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis pathway  and, therefore, increased glucose oxidation was proposed to serve as a mechanism to compensate for reduced glycogen synthesis in the presence of higher glucose levels within the skeletal muscle . Our data similarly indicate preferential glucose oxidation compared with glycogen synthesis pathways, as absolute glucose oxidation rates were not altered despite lower glucose uptake.
21562755:113	Glucose oxidation as a percentage of R d was thus increased.
21562755:114	Finally, prednisolone 30 mg tended to decrease basal lipolysis and NEFA levels compared with placebo.
21562755:115	In acute studies, cortisol infusion was shown to increase lipolysis in the fasted state.
21562755:116	In these studies, hyperinsulinaemia was prevented by performing a pancreatic clamp with insulin infusion at basal levels . In studies addressing the effects of chronic GC treatment, typically no changes were observed in whole-body lipolysis in the fasted state , and fasting insulin levels were increased . In our study we found a tendency towards decreased lipolysis.
21562755:117	As lipolysis is more sensitive to small changes in insulin concentration than EGP , and plasma NEFA levels are closely correlated with changes in lipolysis, we hypothesise that decreased basal lipolysis and NEFA levels in individuals receiving prednisolone 30 mg may be because of the observed prednisolone-induced 80% increase in fasting plasma insulin levels.
21562755:118	The negative correlation between the treatment-induced change in fasting plasma insulin and fasting NEFA levels ( r  = −0.564;
21562755:119	p  = 0.001) supports our hypothesis.
21562755:120	Another hypothesis is that prednisolone 30 mg decreased the sympathetic tone to adipose tissue, resulting in lower rates of basal lipolysis . 
The mechanisms underlying prednisolone-induced insulin resistance on the various metabolic fluxes have not been elucidated.
21562755:121	GCs were shown to interfere with insulin signalling in vitro and in vivo in rodents in liver , adipose tissue  and skeletal muscle .
21562755:122	On the other hand, GCs may also directly activate genes involved in the regulation of various metabolic fluxes.
21562755:123	As such, GCs were shown to induce phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-controlling enzyme in hepatic glucose production . In addition, hormone-sensitive lipase, a major regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis was demonstrated to be regulated by GCs .
21562755:124	Moreover, GCs directly activated muscle ring finger-1 and atrogin-1, proteins involved in skeletal muscle proteolysis .
21562755:125	Finally, GCs impaired glucose transport into skeletal muscle independent of changes in insulin signalling . 
In the present study we exposed healthy volunteers to different doses of prednisolone, allowing us to specifically measure the metabolic effects of prednisolone.
21562755:126	In clinical practice, prednisolone is used to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.
21562755:127	As systemic inflammation also impairs insulin sensitivity , the effects of GCs on various fluxes, given their combined anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects, could be more complex in this population.
21562755:128	One potential, yet inevitable, limitation of our experimental design when addressing the effects of real-life oral prednisolone treatment, as compared with previously reported, more artificial cortisol infusion studies, is that our clamp tests were performed under non-steady-state prednisolone levels.
21562755:129	As prednisolone has a t 1/2 of 4–6 h, the final part of the clamp may have been performed under lower prednisolone levels.
21562755:130	However, plasma prednisolone levels may be a poor marker of its dynamics, as many actions of prednisolone are genomic of nature, which take a number of hours to become effected.
21562755:131	In addition, our participants were treated for 2 weeks, in contrast to the acute studies that have been mostly conducted up to now and, therefore, differences caused by the acute effects of prednisolone treatment may be very limited.
21562755:132	We conclude that GC treatment, even at a low so-called maintenance dose that is prescribed to large numbers of patients for prolonged periods of time, impairs both glucose metabolism and lipolysis by impairing the metabolic actions of insulin on the liver and adipose tissue.
21562755:133	The results of this study uncover the mechanisms by which GC doses just above cortisol replacement levels, particularly when used chronically, may impair glucose tolerance in susceptible patients.
21562755:134	Physicians treating patients with low-dose GCs should be aware of the induction of metabolic disturbances and should not solely rely on fasting measurements.
21562755:135	In addition, our study indicates that insulin-sensitising therapies could be considered when treating patients with GC therapy.
21562755:136	As such, the thiazolidinedione troglitazone was shown to prevent GC-induced glucose intolerance in healthy humans . Troglitazone, however, is no longer available for use in humans, and therefore a search for other options to alleviate GC-induced insulin resistance seems justified.
19865514:0	Introduction 
Aging is a natural process which is related to several morphological and biochemical changes that happens from maturity to senescence, making the organism vulnerable to diseases and toxicity, and eventually leading to cellular death.
19865514:1	According to the hypothesis of oxidative stress on aging, the loss of functional capacity associated to senescence comes from accumulation of molecular oxidative damages  brought about by (toxic) free radicals produced during normal breathing.
19865514:2	Free radicals were previously reported as being capable of damaging a lot of cellular components such as proteins, lipids and DNA .
19865514:3	To protect the cells from oxidative damages by oxidants, produced during oxygen methabolism, an antioxidant system is used by aerobic organisms.
19865514:4	The main antioxidant agents such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione, ascorbic acid and tocopherol are important for cellular protection, due to their ability to eliminate free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) . Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the biochemical functions of natural antioxidant extracts from vegetables, fruits, and medicinal plants, which can become candidates to prevent oxidative damage, promoting health.
19865514:5	The phenolic constituents found in vegetables have received considerable attention for being the main components of antioxidant activity, in spite of not being the only ones.
19865514:6	The antioxidant activity of phenolic constituents has been attributed to its oxide-reduction properties, which play an important role in the adsorption or neutralization of free radicals . 
Medicinal plants have been a useful source for the research of new biologically active compounds.
19865514:7	Different approaches are used to select a plant for research, specially the ethno-medical data approach.
19865514:8	Unfortunately, the ethno-medical data is not always completely reliable, since it is difficult to diagnosed cancer well.
19865514:9	Apart from the medicinal effects of traditional herbs, exploratory researches have been made and a wide variety of new biological activities from traditional medicinal plants have recently been reported, including anticancer activity . 
Centella asiatica (L) Urb., popularly known in Brazil as cairuçu-asiático, centelha, codagem and pata-de-mula , is a cosmopolitan member of the Umbelliferae family that presents pantropical distribution.
19865514:10	It is a perennial herb that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat several disorders, such as insanity, asthma, leprosy, ulcers and eczema and for wound healing . Centella asiatica contains triterpene glycosides such as centellasaponin, asiaticoside, madecassoside and sceffoleoside , and also asiatic acid and madecassic acid . Asiaticoside is the most abundant triterpene glycoside in the water extract and it is transformed into asiatic acid in vivo by hydrolysis.
19865514:11	Although the asiatic acid has shown cytotoxic activity on fibroblast cells  and induces apoptosis in different sorts of cancer  , to date no scientific report related the presence of phenolic compounds of Centella asiatica to cytotoxic activity.
19865514:12	Consequently, we have focused on establishing a relationship between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity with cytotoxic activity, evaluating the activity against cancer cell lines using aqueous extract (AE) obtained from Centella asiatica leaves.
19865514:13	Results and Discussion 
The AE showed a phenolic constituents level of 2.86 g/100 g.
19865514:14	A recent report  showed that the method used quantifies mainly high-molecular weight tannins, such as hydrolysable tannin and other polyphenols that have a molecule of gallic acid in its structure, absorbing energy at the wavelength of 760 nm.
19865514:15	In fact, values found in this study are in agreement with the results published recently which obtained values ranging from 3.23–11.7 g/100 g for different parts of Centella asiatica . 
The flavonoids level in the AE was 0.361 g/100 g.
19865514:16	Flavonoids are highly polar molecules of low molecular weight which absorb energy around 420 nm.
19865514:17	Water is a polar extractant, so it will extract polar constituents, such as heterosides.
19865514:18	In this work, water was used as liquid extractant and the level of flavonoids observed was high, suggesting that these flavonoid constituents might be in the heteroside form, since previous studies showed that flavonoids can be found in nature in the free state or in the form of glycosides . 
The antioxidant activity of AE of Centella asiatica was evaluated by its ability to scavenge DPPH free radicals.
19865514:19	The radical scavenging activity of the compounds can be measured by the decolorizing effect following the trapping of the unpaired electrons of DPPH.
19865514:20	The AE showed a high antioxidant activity, with an IC 50 value of 31.25 μg/mL.
19865514:21	Ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) produced IC 50 values of 2.50 μg/mL and 7.58 μg/mL, respectively.
19865514:22	Based on previous data, it is possible that the powerful antioxidant activity of polar extracts is due to the presence of substances with free hydroxyls . In this context, flavonoids possess an ideal structure for the scavenging of free radicals, since they present a number of hydroxyls acting as hydrogen-donators which makes them important antioxidant agents .
19865514:23	The key role of phenolic compounds as free radical scavengers is emphasized in two important reports . Antioxidative properties of essential oils and various extracts from many plants are of great interest in both academia and the food industry, since their possible use as natural additives has emerged from a growing trend to replace synthetic antioxidants by natural ones.
19865514:24	Regarding this trend, the study of medicinal plant species has became of great importance, to find and test their bioactive compounds.
19865514:25	The results indicate that AE obtained from Centella asiatica leaves showed the capacity to donate hydrogen; therefore they present DPPH scavenging activity.
19865514:26	This activity might be due to the presence of phenolic and flavonic constituents detected in the samples.
19865514:27	The results are in agreement with the recent study, which showed that Centella asiatica prevents the oxidative damage existing in several neuropathologies including stroke, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, improving the antioxidant neurological state related to aging . 
The cytotoxic activity (IC 50) of AE against four cancer cell lines and one normal cell line are shown in .
19865514:28	The AE of Centella asiatica demonstrated a promising activity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB 231) and mouse melanoma (B 16F 1) (648.0 and 698.0 μg/mL, respectivelly), while that for rat glioma (C 6) the IC 50 was 1,000.0 μg/mL.
19865514:29	On the other hand, the extract was not cytotoxic at the tested concentrations (up to 1,000.0 μg/mL) towards the human lung carcinoma (A 549) and normal hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell lines.
19865514:30	The cytotoxic activity of AE shown in this work presented in the same range of cytotoxicity (10–1,000 μg/mL) towards the B 16F 1, MDA-MB 231 and C 6 cell lines demonstrated in studies with extracts of other plants with cytotoxic potential in South Korea , Tanzania , Italy and Jordan . Another report  shows that the purified asiatic acid, also present in the AE, decreased the viability of MDA-MB 231 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
19865514:31	Moreover, the extract was not cytotoxic against the A 549 (lung carcinoma) and BHK-21 (normal kidney cancer) cell lines.
19865514:32	These results suggest a possible selectivity of the AE of Centella asiatica against some cancer cell lines, as observed for the cisplatin compounds, that are preferentially used for testicular  and ovarian cancer . The selectivity of action could be related to the differences in morphology and physiology between tested cell lines, although this is not yet proven.
19865514:33	These results are very encouraging, considering that most chemotherapeutic agents found on the market act both on tumor and normal cells  and cannot promote a specific treatment for the cancer without causing side effects as a result of damage to normal cells.
19865514:34	Although asiaticoside has not been reported in the scientific literature as a cytotoxic agent, the activity presented here may be related to its major presence in the extract, or even its performance in synergy with other constituents such as phenolic and flavonic constituents identified in this extract.
19865514:35	Oxidative stress leads to the damage of membrane lipids, DNA, protein and cellular organelles, contributing to the development of cancer, early-aging, cardiovascular diseases, degenerative and neurological diseases and others.
19865514:36	The phenolic constituents, especially the flavonoids, have high antioxidant capacity due to its properties of oxidation-reduction which plays an important role in the adsorption or neutralization of free radicals  showing raised biological protection.
19865514:37	Since free radicals are involved in the establishment of cancer, the AE containing asiaticoside and other phenolic constituents can act reducing the number of free radicals (antioxidant activity), however at higher concentrations, promotes the cytotoxic effect, as observed in the results of cytotoxic assay.
19865514:38	Experimental 
Conclusions 
The results of this study demonstrate the antioxidant capacity of the AE of Centella asiatica related to its phenolic and flavonoid constituents and its antitumor potential against cancer cell lines.
19865514:39	The results suggest that the potent antioxidant and antitumor activity are justified by the high concentration of phenolic constituents, mainly the flavonoids present in the extract.
19865514:40	This study indicates that bioactive molecules present in Centella asiatica can be used as a prototype for development of new drugs and/or as a source of antioxidant and antitumor pharmaceutical raw material.
20927279:0	INTRODUCTION 
Leprosy is still prevalent in certain parts of the world, particularly India and South America.
20927279:1	Social stigma and prejudices associated with leprosy still remain major obstacles for its eradication.
20927279:2	After India had declared the goal of elimination of leprosy, it was no longer cost effective to rely on rapid surveys, population surveys and contact tracing for case detection, and since then most new cases have been diagnosed by the General Health Service staff; and since 2001, MDT services were integrated with the general healthcare delivery system.
20927279:3	Human resource development of general healthcare system (GHS) is a vital preparatory action for successful integration of leprosy into GHS.
20927279:4	District-level technical support teams (DTSTs) have been formed with responsibility for building up the capacity of medical and paramedical staff working at various levels of the system.
20927279:5	Studies indicated that in the currently declining phase of leprosy endemicity, employing a conventionally trained, salaried class of paramedical staff for field surveys is prohibitively expensive in view of the high cost per case detected.
20927279:6	Involving primary healthcare workers and community-derived workers is cost effective.
20927279:7	Integration of the vertical leprosy program with the existing horizontal health program poses various administrative and operational challenges for program managers.
20927279:8	In this context, it is necessary to know the current levels of knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) prevailing among healthcare personnel with regard to leprosy at a given point in time, so that required knowledge and skills can be imparted.
20927279:9	This study was carried out to identify the health-providing behavior of healthcare personnel working in an endemic region of Kamrup district of Assam under the MDT-implementation and leprosy-elimination program.
20927279:10	MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This cross-sectional study was based on both quantitative and qualitative parameters with review of relevant documents, records and literature at Kamrup district of Assam, India, from March 2007 to June 2007.
20927279:11	To assess the training status and program management at the community level, it was decided to interview the medical officers and health workers working in various health institutions in the district.
20927279:12	The district has two divisions: urban and rural.
20927279:13	Rural Kamrup had 14 block primary health centers (PHCs).
20927279:14	Keeping in view the operational feasibility and manpower constraints, we took up about 25% of these PHCs, i.e., four.
20927279:15	These four PHCs were selected randomly from the set.
20927279:16	The following block PHCs got selected, viz.,
20927279:17	Uparhali block PHC, Boko block PHC, Sonapur block PHC and Hajo block PHC.
20927279:18	For urban representation, we had taken into consideration major government health institutions.
20927279:19	The Upgraded Urban Leprosy Centre attached to the dermatology clinic of Guwahati Medical College, and the Urban Leprosy Centre attached to Mohendra Mohan Hospital (MMH) were the primary sources of data.
20927279:20	Secondary data, i.e., data regarding the manpower involved in delivering healthcare in these selected centers, was collected from the office of the Director of Health Services.
20927279:21	The data collection tool used for the study was an interview schedule that was developed at the institute with the assistance from the faculty members and other experts.
20927279:22	Different information modalities were sought from different groups of health personnel.
20927279:23	The questionnaire was discussed among the faculty of Department of Community Medicine, Guwahati Medical College, and it was also shared with the zonal officers of the district dealing with leprosy.
20927279:24	The schedule was then pre-tested in the field to rule out operational constraints.
20927279:25	The pilot study was carried out at the institute among general healthcare personnel, following which some of the questions from the interview schedule were modified.
20927279:26	This pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaire contained questions relating to the information on designation of the staff; his/ her training status in leprosy; the presence or absence of knowledge about leprosy, its categorization, its treatment modalities; and individual involvement in the National Leprosy Eradication Programme The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of Guwahati Medical College.
20927279:27	All the healthcare providers present during the study period were included.
20927279:28	Those on leave or transferred to another district were excluded from the study.
20927279:29	Accordingly, 50 medical officers, 40 health supervisors, 66 male multipurpose health workers and nonmedical assistants, 65 female multipurpose health workers and auxiliary nurse midwives, along with 8 policy makers at the district headquarters, were selected for study.
20927279:30	All the participants were explained about the purpose of the study and were ensured strict confidentiality, and then informed consent was taken from each of them.
20927279:31	They were given the option of not participating in the study if they so desired.
20927279:32	Statistical analysis 
The data collected were thoroughly screened and entered into MS-Excel spreadsheets, and analysis was carried out.
20927279:33	The procedures involved were transcription, preliminary data inspection, content analysis and interpretation.
20927279:34	Percentages were used in this study to analyze study variables.
20927279:35	RESULTS 
Among the program managers interviewed, only half were organizing training sessions, and 37.5% were involved in supervision of the program activities at the periphery level . 
Regarding training status in leprosy, 90% of medical officers, 80% of health supervisors and around 87% of MPWs (83% of male MPWs and 89% of female MPWs) had attended training programs on leprosy . 
The health-providing behavior of the program-implementing personnel was also studied.
20927279:36	Sixty percent of the medical officers had a role to play in Information Education Communication (IEC).
20927279:37	Among the health supervisors, 90% were aware of the cause of leprosy, while 92.5% were aware of the diagnosis, categorization of patients and treatment according to category.
20927279:38	All the health supervisors knew about MDT, and 80% of them had an idea about the program.
20927279:39	Seventy-five percent of them played a role in IEC campaign.
20927279:40	Among male grass-root level multipurpose workers, 83.3% were aware of the cause of leprosy; 87.9% could diagnose the disease; 84.8% were aware of MDT, categorization of patients and their treatment duration; 81.8% had knowledge of the program; and 78.8% were involved in IEC campaigns.
20927279:41	Among female MPWs, 66.2% were aware of the cause of the disease; 87.7% could diagnose the disease; 86.2% had an idea of MDT and treatment duration of various categories of patients; 80% of respondents could categorize the patients; 76.9% knew about the program; and 90.7% of the respondents had a role to play in IEC campaigns . 
DISCUSSION 
Our study revealed a diverse yet good knowledge and attitudes towards leprosy among the ‘MDT (multidrug therapy)’-implementing personnel.
20927279:42	Medical officers consistently demonstrated higher knowledge about leprosy in comparison with health supervisors and multipurpose workers, including nursing staff.
20927279:43	In a study from Hyderabad city, conducted in Government Health Services dispensaries in Hyderabad in order to assess KAP and some operational parameters, medical officers consistently demonstrated higher knowledge about leprosy, followed by nursing staff and paramedical workers.
20927279:44	More than half of the study subjects did not have specific training in leprosy.
20927279:45	A study was undertaken as part of operational research by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, to assess the level of integration of leprosy services into general healthcare system in 24 low or moderately endemic states/ union territories.
20927279:46	The data in this study included training status of general healthcare staff with regard to leprosy.
20927279:47	About half (53.2%) of the existing medical officers, 83.9% of health supervisors and 96.8% of multipurpose workers were found to be trained in leprosy.
20927279:48	The study emphasized the need for training; as only 31.3% of medical officers were able to diagnose leprosy, and most of them were relying on vertical staff and skin specialists for confirmation.
20927279:49	Assam reported a higher level (97%) of training of medical officers in leprosy.
20927279:50	Training of health supervisors and multipurpose workers was better than that of medical officers in most of the states.
20927279:51	Tripura reported negligible training of all the health functionaries because of specific local problems.
20927279:52	In Assam and Maharashtra, medical officers in all (100%) health facilities were diagnosing and treating leprosy cases, as compared with Himachal Pradesh (30%).
20927279:53	However, lower involvement of GHS staff in recording and reporting was noted in Assam (both 0%, respectively), Andhra Pradesh (10% and 30%, respectively).
20927279:54	An investigation into the attitudes, beliefs and behavior of 730 primary healthcare (PHC) workers with regard to MDT was carried out in Yangzhou and Dongtai districts of China, which revealed that only half of the PHC workers had a basic knowledge of MDT and a desire to participate in MDT implementation.
20927279:55	The knowledge and attitude of health workers in northwestern Botswana with regard to leprosy were determined by interviewing 99 health workers from various health institutions.
20927279:56	Knowledge on causation of leprosy was generally lacking.
20927279:57	Although majority of respondents knew that the disease is curable, less than half knew the correct duration of treatment.
20927279:58	A study conducted by the Regional Leprosy Training and Research Institute, Lalpur, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India, revealed that 45% of medical officers, 71% of health supervisors and 75% of multipurpose workers were trained in leprosy.
20927279:59	CONCLUSION 
To sum up, these observations suggest that there appear to be adequate knowledge and positive behavior of healthcare providers with regard to leprosy in this part of India.
20927279:60	However, there is still a need to organize training programs at regular intervals to train new recruits, as well as reinforce and update the knowledge of those already trained.
20927279:61	In view of the changing logistics, it is very necessary that manpower training and reinforcements should be given serious consideration by health planners.
16884541:0	Background 
Obesity is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and is a major causes of preventable death in Western countries, and increasingly also in developing countries.
16884541:1	In addition, obesity can also be a psychological problem as a slender posture is associated with physical and social attractiveness, and in most Western countries dieting, exercising etc. are multi-billion industries.
16884541:2	Some individuals, in particular women, apparently perceive obesity as a more acute problem than cigarette smoking, which they use for weight control.
16884541:3	Despite widespread recognition that physical attractiveness correlates strongly (inversely) with body mass index (BMI), there appears to be a dearth of studies on the effectiveness of slimness in attracting sex partners, the choice of sex partners, and whether this may pose a risk for acquiring sexually transmitted infections.
16884541:4	In addition to mere physical attractiveness psychological factors associated with BMI may also play a role in sexual behaviour.
16884541:5	Sexual behaviour surveys have been carried out in many countries, and their methodology has been extensively researched.
16884541:6	However, with rare exceptions these studies appear to have ignored the issue of body mass index as one of the few objectively measurable dimensions of physical attractiveness as a correlate of actual sexual behaviour; and those that did, appear to have included only opportunistic samples, and did not actually measure BMI.
16884541:7	Perhaps, this is because measurement of BMI involves physical examination, whereas most of these surveys are based on questionnaires or interviews.
16884541:8	We therefore decided to explore the relationship between obesity, sexual behaviour, and the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, and estimate reported rates of partner change and the risk of Herpes Simplex Type 2 (HSV-2) antibody prevalence, a marker of cumulative sexual risk, as a function of body mass index, adjusting for other behavioural and demographic variables.
16884541:9	For this, we used the (publicly available, free of charge) USA, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2000 data.
16884541:10	Methods 
Results 
A total of 979 men and 1250 women were available for analysis.
16884541:11	Table shows some of their demographic and behavioural characteristics; Table shows the number of heterosexual partners in the last year and lifetime by BMI class.
16884541:12	Very few individuals reported any same-sex relationships.
16884541:13	Only 29 men and 41 women reported any life-time same-sex partners, of these 20 and 34 reported <=2 such partners.
16884541:14	Of 895 (143 HSV-2 positive) men and 1139 (333 HSV-2 positive) women the HSV-2 serostatus was known.
16884541:15	Of 633 men and 853 women the urine Gonococcal (GC) and Chlamydia (CT) status was known.
16884541:16	However, as only 2 men and 2 women were positive for GC and only 17 and 26 respectively for CT, we decided not to further explore these infections.
16884541:17	There was a large difference between the mean number of life-time sex partners reported by men, 18.18, and the number reported by women, 6.07.
16884541:18	The same held true for the mean number of partners reported during the last year, viz . 1.54 and 1.03 respectively.
16884541:19	In view of this large discrepancy between male and female number of partners, we further explored the reliability of the reported number of life-time partners by considering the HSV-2 serostatus among those individuals who reported no life-time sex partners.
16884541:20	Of these 132 men and 152 women, 24 and 44 respectively were HSV-2 positive, substantially more than among those reporting one life-time sex partner (men:2/63, women:16/224).
16884541:21	Although, most of these HSV-2 positive individuals probably misreported their number of life-time partners, we did not wish to exclude them to avoid introducing bias.
16884541:22	However, as a sensitivity analysis we redid the analyses for individuals reporting at least one life-time sex partner.
16884541:23	Discussion 
This is the first time that in a population representative sample an association between BMI and sexual behaviour has been demonstrated.
16884541:24	The effect is substantial, with obese men reporting on average more than 10 life-time partners less than men with normal BMI.
16884541:25	There are several possible explanations for this observation.
16884541:26	For example, men with a desire to be highly sexual active and have many partners may invest in maintaining and cultivating an attractive body.
16884541:27	Alternatively, obese men may not be able to attract the mates that they desire and thus have fewer partners than wanted.
16884541:28	Also, perhaps attractive men sometimes behave opportunistically, and respond positively to women who are attracted by them.
16884541:29	It is interesting that BMI appears to have little effect on the self-reported number of life-time partners in women, despite its influence on recent rate of partner change.
16884541:30	Rather surprisingly, the number of partners in the last 12 months in men appears to be independent of age in men, while in women – not unexpectedly – it tends to decrease with age in women over 30.
16884541:31	The association between smoking and sexual behaviour, especially in women, which has been reported before, is interesting as it impacts on two important health-related behaviours, viz . smoking and obesity, and a better understanding of this relationship may be instrumental in interventions targeting high risk behaviour.
16884541:32	HSV-2 infection was highly prevalent in this sample, as generally in the US population.
16884541:33	It is surprising that despite a clear influence of BMI on the number of life-time partners it appears to have little effect on HSV-2 serostatus.
16884541:34	If HSV-2 would only be a function of the number of one's life time partners one would expect a lower HSV-2 prevalence in individuals with a high BMI.
16884541:35	Lacking detailed data, one can only speculate why this is not the case.
16884541:36	Perhaps, a high BMI is associated with choosing high risk partners, or with low condom use in high risk partnerships.
16884541:37	Some of the other risk factors we identified for HSV-2 infection, such as African -American ethnicity, confirm earlier findings.
16884541:38	It is noteworthy that age – even after adjustment for the number of life-time partners – is generally associated with HSV-2 status (positively in men and young women, negatively in older women).
16884541:39	This is in line with previous analyses of (earlier) NHANES data.
16884541:40	Perhaps, large numbers of life-time partners in young individuals reflect large numbers of partnerships of very short duration during which infection is less likely to occur.
16884541:41	Alternatively, individuals preferentially select partners of their own age, and older partners are more likely to be HSV-2 positive themselves.
16884541:42	The association between smoking and HSV-2 serostatus has received some attention in the past, as has its association with other sexually transmitted infections, particularly Human Papilloma Virus, and cervical cancer.
16884541:43	In the NHANES data this association between smoking and HSV-2 disappears after adjustment for the number of life-time partners in men but not in women.
16884541:44	Women who ever smoked were about 50% more likely to be HSV-2 infected than non-smoking women.
16884541:45	Although, smoking may differentially affect HSV-2 susceptibility in women, residual confounding cannot be ruled out.
16884541:46	Smoking is correlated with social-economic status (SES), and SES may be associated with variables such as choice of partner, condom use, and bias in self reported number of sex partners.
16884541:47	Whether the same also hold true for age at first sex, which appears to be negatively associated with HSV-2 serostatus, even after adjustment for the reported number of life-time partners, is unclear.
16884541:48	Perhaps, some biological effect that makes younger individuals more susceptible than older ones, account for this association.
16884541:49	Our results have to be interpreted with care.
16884541:50	The association between BMI and the number of life time partners is (probably) diluted by the obvious fact that BMI is not constant throughout life.
16884541:51	BMI rises with age, and although BMI at different ages is positively correlated, this correlation is by no means perfect.
16884541:52	Misreporting in sexual behaviour surveys is extremely common.
16884541:53	For example, of the 132 men and 152 women who reported zero life-time sex partners, 24 and 44 respectively tested HSV-2 positive.
16884541:54	Also, as is common in sexual behaviour surveys, men reported far more partners than women.
16884541:55	This occurred despite the fact that sexual behaviour interviewing was done using the NHANES audio computer assisted self interview (in either English or Spanish) a methodology which has been widely used for eliciting information on private and sensitive issues.
16884541:56	Whether this is because women systematically under-report, or men over-report, their number of partners, or whether surveys tend to miss women with very large numbers of sex partners is unclear.
16884541:57	The hypothesis that underreporting by women rather than selection bias accounts for some of this difference is suggested by the lack of a significant age effect in the regression analyses of women's number of life-time partners.
16884541:58	Unless younger generations are more promiscuous than older ones this would seem implausible.
16884541:59	Interestingly, in view of the high HSV-2 prevalence among men reporting no partners, not only women appear to underreport sexual behaviour, but also some men.
16884541:60	In view of the difficulty of obtaining reliable data on relatively simple variables such as number of partners, the task of measuring more complex behaviour such as concurrency, i.e. having multiple partners simultaneously instead of sequentially, is formidable and seems beyond the reach of current methods of eliciting information from informants.
16884541:61	It emphasizes the need for better methods to measure sexual behaviour than current interviewing techniques.
16884541:62	Perhaps, biological markers, such as antibodies to sexually transmitted infections, may provide an alternative, although – as this study also shows – we still have to learn their precise interpretation.
16884541:63	Conclusion 
Obese and overweight individuals, especially men, self report fewer sex partners than individuals of normal weight, but surprisingly this is not reflected in their risk of HSV-2 infection.
16884541:64	HSV-2 antibodies provide information not contained in self-reported number of partners and may better estimate sexual risk than self-reported behaviour.

20584337:0	Introduction 
Although peno-scrotal lymphedema is common, isolated penile lymphedema is extremely rare . A literature review for the last 30 years revealed only two cases of isolated penile involvement.
20584337:1	In the first, chronic lymphatic edema occurred due to long term usage of a penile ring . In the second case  the penile swelling resulted from donovanosis.
20584337:2	We present a case of isolated penile lymphedema that was caused by recurrent skin infection.
20584337:3	Genital lymphedema is an accumulation of lymph in the superficial lymphatic channels between skin and fasciae: Colles' fascia in the scrotum and Buck's fascia in the penis . The testes, the spermatic cord, the corpora, and the glans drain into the deep lymphatics, and are not affected by the disease process.
20584337:4	Penoscrotal lymphedema is disfiguring.
20584337:5	It is also associated with pain, difficulties with urination, and sexual dysfunction . Diagnosis of lymphedema is easy, but determining its etiology is much more difficult.
20584337:6	Conditions that damage the penile lymphatics, resulting in lymphedema, include neoplasia, surgical trauma and radiation.
20584337:7	Chronic or recurrent acute infection may also cause lymphedema.
20584337:8	Examples include donovanosis, tuberculosis and parasitic diseases such as filariasis . Primary lymphedema is less common, and is due to an intrinsic abnormality in lymphatic channels, such as lymphatic aplasia, hypoplasia and hyperplasia.
20584337:9	Elephantiasis is a term usually applied to long standing lymphedema with numerous folds and variable thickening in the skin and hardening of the subcutaneous tissue due to fibrosis.
20584337:10	Case presentation 
A 32-year-old Arab man presented with a three-year history of a painless fusiform swelling in the penis.
20584337:11	The swelling was preceded by three episodes of furunculosis over a nine-month period, soon after which he developed this swelling.
20584337:12	The infection itself was characterized by relapses and remissions, with the total duration of infection being four months within these nine months.
20584337:13	The infection was associated with pus that discharged spontaneously through minute sinuses.
20584337:14	It responded very slowly to systemic and local antibiotic treatment as well as improved personal hygiene.
20584337:15	Eventually healing was accomplished, leaving the penile skin thickened and irregular.
20584337:16	The onset of the swelling was gradual, with edema that spread circumferentially and peripherally along the penile shaft.
20584337:17	Our patient's main complaint was non-erectile sexual dysfunction.
20584337:18	He had no urinary tract symptoms.
20584337:19	There was no history of irradiation, surgery, trauma, or travel to areas endemic with filariasis.
20584337:20	He denied a contributory family history.
20584337:21	On examination he had gross penile enlargement, maximally at the mid shaft, where the circumference was 21 cm.
20584337:22	The skin was thick, with numerous irregular shallow folds (Figure ).
20584337:23	The glans penis, penile root, scrotal sac, thigh and perineal skin were normal.
20584337:24	Both testes could be identified easily.
20584337:25	He maintained poor local hygiene.
20584337:26	Serology for filariasis was normal, and ultrasound of testes and lower urinary tract as well as abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormality.
20584337:27	The clinical diagnosis was secondary lymphedema following recurrent penile furunculosis.
20584337:28	We planned surgery for our patient.
20584337:29	Written informed consent was obtained after an explanation of the procedure and expected outcomes.
20584337:30	The operation was started by two circular incisions around the penile shaft at the penile corona and root level, followed by a median dorsal incision made through skin and subcutaneous tissue.
20584337:31	The incisions were carefully extended down to Buck's fascia from the penile root to the coronal sulcus.
20584337:32	The two lateral lymphedematous segments of tissue were separated from the fascia by sharp dissection, leaving the penile shaft exposed.
20584337:33	Closure of the penile shaft was accomplished by bilateral advancement of sleeve-like flaps from both ends of the penis and suture with monofilament non-resorbable suture (Figure ).
20584337:34	Histopathologic examination showed non-specific chronic inflammation with areas of epidermal thickening and dermal fibrosis.
20584337:35	The wound healed well, and sutures were removed on the 14th post-operative day.
20584337:36	Antibiotic cover with penicillin was administered one day pre-operatively and for 14 days post-operatively.
20584337:37	He made an uneventful recovery.
20584337:38	He had residual edema in the reflected mucosa of the coronal sulcus, which disappeared within one month.
20584337:39	He resumed a normal sexual activity one month after surgery.
20584337:40	At 12 months, he had a good cosmetic result, with no signs of recurrence.
20584337:41	Discussion 
Male genital lymphedema typically involves the scrotum, and involvement of the penile shaft occurs late.
20584337:42	Isolate penile lymphedema may result from surgery, irradiation, or from certain chronic infections.
20584337:43	Long standing penile skin infection with subsequent fibrosis in the subcutaneous tissue outside the tunica may obstruct the lymphatic channels leading to development of penile lymphedema.
20584337:44	Genital lymphadema following recurrent furunculosis has not been reported.
20584337:45	Our patient probably developed recurrent furunculosis due to poor personal hygiene, which was also evident at the time of the current presentation.
20584337:46	In our patient the chronic infection caused extensive lymphatic damage at the penile root, with consequent lymphedema.
20584337:47	Although significant improvement is possible by a variety of methods, the treatment of choice in genital lymphedema is excision of all abnormal tissue [ - ].
20584337:48	This is easy; the challenge is in providing a cover to exposed areas.
20584337:49	There are two options: a local skin flap and a split skin graft [ - ].
20584337:50	The posterior scrotal and the perineal skin have a collateral lymphatic drainage and are usually available and can be used to generate flaps for scrotal reconstruction.
20584337:51	Dandapat et al . , reviewing 350 cases, concluded that satisfactory results were achieved by using local flaps to the scrotum.
20584337:52	They recommended split thickness skin grafts for penile cover.
20584337:53	Tapper et al .  were able to cover the scrotum and penis by local skin flaps after excision of the lymphedematous tissue.
20584337:54	The results were satisfactory at one year of follow up.
20584337:55	Longer follow up was required in predicting the recurrence, especially in flap cases.
20584337:56	Yormuk et al .  described a case where surgical excision was performed for recurrent lymphedema.
20584337:57	They used a local flap to cover the scrotum and a split thickness skin graft for the penile cover.
20584337:58	There was a good result at five years of follow up.
20584337:59	The unavailability of nearby normal skin to cover the penile part by flaps leaves surgeons with only the choice of skin graft.
20584337:60	McDougal  suggested that the inner preputial skin can be spared and used for partial penile coverage in uncircumcised patients.
20584337:61	Alternatively, sleeve-like flaps at both ends, when available, can be advanced bilaterally to provide good cover, as in our case.
20584337:62	The flap has better cosmetic results, but a higher incidence of local recurrence . Malloy et al .  advocated the use of a split skin graft for penoscrotal elephantiasis after they noticed some cases of recurrence in the local flap.
20584337:63	The split skin graft has the advantage of lower recurrence rates, but the cosmetic results are poorer [ , ] and the subsequent contraction in the skin graft decreases the graft elasticity: this imposes additional problems during erection.
20584337:64	We suggest that a flap provides penile cover with better cosmesis, low contraction rates, and adequate elasticity for erection.
20584337:65	If one is compelled to use a graft, a full thickness graft (Wolfe) may be a better choice than a split thickness graft.
20584337:66	Mesh grafts  yield poor cosmetic results, and are rarely required.
20584337:67	Conclusions 
Long standing skin infection with subsequent fibrosis may lead to development of penile lymphedema.
20584337:68	We present a patient who developed isolated penile lymphedema following recurrent furunculosis.
20584337:69	After lymphedema excision, cover of the denuded penile shaft by tailored skin flaps provided excellent cosmetic results and good sexual function.

21479240:0	Introduction 
In many research fields, meta-analyses play an increasingly important role for synthesizing evidence from studies that have been published in the past.
21479240:1	Since not all studies and analyses that have been undertaken are eventually published in the scientific literature, meta-analyses typically rely on incomplete samples of study outcomes.
21479240:2	These samples might be biased, because the result of a study or of a specific analysis might influence its chances to become reported.
21479240:3	Studies with results that achieve formal statistical significance might, for example, have increased chances to become published – . Biases also results from the way data and outcomes are analyzed and represented in scientific publications – . The resulting selective reporting bias might distort the conclusions of a meta-analysis.
21479240:4	Statistical methods have been developed to detect and correct for selective reporting biases . These methods have limitations and may even lead to misleading inferences when applied to single meta-analyses with limited data.
21479240:5	In particular, the frequently used funnel plots and related tests have been criticized . Additional complications arise from the possibility that selective reporting may depend on the position of a study in the sequence of all published studies.
21479240:6	The first published study is often the most biased one towards an extreme result.
21479240:7	Subsequent studies might be biased against the result of the first one; this pattern has been observed for molecular medicine publications and has been referred to as the Proteus phenomenon . Such complex dynamic patterns of bias are difficult to account for by conventional statistical approaches that typically assume a simple bias to operate.
21479240:8	Aside from statistical approaches, it is very difficult to verify the existence of unpublished studies or the presence of excessive selective reporting; for alternative methodologies including surveys and experimental approaches see refs.
21479240:9	– . 
Here, we present an approach to quantify selective reporting from large-scale datasets of published results.
21479240:10	Such datasets are currently emerging in a number of research fields, including molecular medicine.
21479240:11	Our approach extends previous work by Hedges and others – and uses weight functions to describe the chances of a study result to be published depending on its characteristics – . Because the traces left due to selective reporting in the distribution of published results can be subtle, the statistical power for detecting biases based on weight function approaches is typically low.
21479240:12	Therefore, a detailed modeling requires extensive datasets with preferably hundreds of studies.
21479240:13	Such datasets can be generated by combining multiple datasets that are expected to be subject to the same bias.
21479240:14	The approach presented here is specifically designed to quantify selective reporting from such combined datasets.
21479240:15	We use our approach to investigate data from the AlzGene database . AlzGene is currently covering a set of over 1,200 case-control studies on nearly 2,300 different genetic markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
21479240:16	A recent evaluation of these data demonstrated that there is a substantial excess of studies with statistically significant results, which strongly suggests the presence of selective reporting bias . The genetic markers covered by the database might have different associations with the disease.
21479240:17	For markers linked to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, for example, there is strong evidence for an association.
21479240:18	Other markers show nominally statistically significant associations in meta-analyses but their credibility is weak; and for most markers, there is likely no association with Alzheimer's disease . 
Despite different association strengths, there is little reason to believe that fundamental differences exist between markers in how selective reporting bias is acting.
21479240:19	Thus, even though selective reporting bias cannot be studied properly on a single marker, because most markers are only covered by a handful of studies each, the combined data are likely highly informative for quantitative models of selective reporting.
21479240:20	Our approach exploits this and allows us to investigate whether initial publications are more biased than subsequent replications, and whether early replications are biased against initial results.
21479240:21	Methods 
Results 
We find for the high-resolution model that the estimated weights for results with standardized z-values (see ) between − 1.64 and 1.64 are relatively constant.
21479240:22	The weights start increasing as | z | increases over a value of 1.64.
21479240:23	This is what one would qualitatively expect for selective reporting bias.
21479240:24	Results that do not reach formal statistical significance are less likely published, irrespective of where exactly the result falls.
21479240:25	The estimated weights in the 10 intervals covering the region between − 1.64 and 1.64 fall roughly around − 0.5 which corresponds to about 60% of non-significant results in any of these intervals being reported.
21479240:26	For a fixed effects model, where the between-study variances are assumed to be zero (see ), the estimated weights are much lower, i.e. indicate an even stronger bias.
21479240:27	This is because in the random-effects model there are two competing mechanisms for explaining a high abundance of extreme results: selective reporting bias and a high between-study variance.
21479240:28	In the fixed-effect model, only the first mechanism is considered, leading to much stronger estimates of the bias.
21479240:29	The high-resolution model reveals an interesting shape of the weight function for results with z-values outside the interval between − 1.64 and 1.64.
21479240:30	Results with two-sided p-values between 0.05 and 0.01 ( 1.96<|z|<2.58) seem to be underrepresented when compared to results with a two-sided p-value smaller than 0.01 (| z | >2.58 ), and with two-sided p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 ( 1.64<|z|<1.96 ).
21479240:31	This observation is somewhat surprising for classical publication bias where the p = 0.05
21479240:32	value is considered to be a salient threshold for publication, but is in line with previous observations .
21479240:33	It may originate from using standardized rather than published p-values and is discussed in more detail further below.
21479240:34	Because the change of the weight function in the high-resolution model is highest at the boundaries of z = −1.64 and z = 1.64
21479240:35	we used these boundaries in the subsequent models (Model 1–3 and Proteus model).
21479240:36	Estimates for the simple random-effects one-parameter model (Model 1) are shown in .
21479240:37	The log weight function in the mid interval is estimated as − 0.33 for the random effects model.
21479240:38	This corresponds to a probability of reporting of about 72% (95% CI from 58% to 90%) relative to studies that fall into the outer intervals.
21479240:39	This estimate is similar to the corresponding estimates in the high-resolution model, but note that we now use different outer intervals (i.e. boundaries at 1.64, and − 1.64).
21479240:40	The error in the estimate of the bias is much lower, because in the one-parameter model each interval contains data from several intervals of the high-resolution model.
21479240:41	The results for the models designed to investigate the initial study bias and the Proteus phenomenon are summarized in .
21479240:42	The estimates for Model 2 reveal that most of the bias stems from initial studies.
21479240:43	These studies show a bias of log w (I)  = −0.81
21479240:44	suggesting that initial studies with standardized effects in the 1.64 to − 1.64 interval have a chance of only 44% (95% CI from 32% to 63%) of being reported, relative to initial studies with results outside that interval.
21479240:45	This bias is considerably stronger than the estimates for subsequent studies ( log w (S)  = −0.17 respectively, corresponding to a probability of 84% compared with studies outside the interval; 95% CI from 66% to 107%).
21479240:46	Thus, initial studies tend to be much more biased than subsequent ones.
21479240:47	The potential origin and consequences of this effect are discussed further below.
21479240:48	All estimates and their standard errors are summarized in .
21479240:49	The results for the Proteus model show that studies that confirm the direction of the effect of an initial study but do not achieve formal statistical significance face more bias than studies with non-significant results that oppose the initial result in terms of the direction of the effect (chances are 73% relative to non-significant studies opposing the initial result, with a 95% CI from 55% to 96%; see Legend for additional details).
21479240:50	This is in line with observations described earlier . Model 3, which has the same number of parameters but does not make the weight function for the second study dependent on the sign of the first result, shows no differences between w (E)1 and w (E)2, and yields a smaller change in the log likelihood score than the Proteus model.
21479240:51	Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Proteus model would be favored for describing the given AD dataset.
21479240:52	The single most important parameter in these models is the one to distinguish bias in initial publications from bias in subsequent ones, which indicates that the initial study bias is a very robust phenomenon.
21479240:53	The maximum likelihood approach outlined in the section does not only yield estimates for the weight function parameters describing selection bias, but can also yield estimates for the association strength (log odds ratios) and between-study variances of each marker with AD after correcting for the selection pattern.
21479240:54	Results for the unbiased random effects model (i.e. uncorrected estimates) and the Proteus model (i.e. estimates corrected for selective reporting) are given in the . A comparison of the result from these two models illustrates the effects of correction for selection bias on association strengths and between-study variances in the Proteus model.
21479240:55	(A summary of the comparison is shown in the .) The differences between the estimates from the two models are rather subtle.
21479240:56	The estimated absolute effect sizes in the Proteus model tend to be smaller than the estimated effect sizes from the uncorrected random effects model.
21479240:57	However, standard errors for the estimates tend to be smaller, too, which means that the standardized effect sizes (z-values) remain similar.
21479240:58	Moreover, the estimates of the between-study variances tend to be smaller for the Proteus models compared to the uncorrected random effects model.
21479240:59	Without correcting for selection biases, effect sizes and between-study variances therefore tend to be overestimated.
21479240:60	Discussion 
Our results illustrate the strength that arises from combining datasets from a large number of primary studies within the same research field.
21479240:61	The approach allows us to obtain a well-resolved picture of the weight function from a large body of literature.
21479240:62	In line with previous results our results from the high-resolution weight function point to a possible under-representation of results with standardized p-values between 0.05 and 0.01, and an excess of studies with p-values between 0.1 and 0.05.
21479240:63	This particular shape of the weight function would have been difficult to obtain with other conventional weight functions such as exponentially declining, or s-shaped weight functions.
21479240:64	The observed over-representation of findings with standardized p-values between 0.1 and 0.05 might result from the use of standardized p-values in our analyses rather than the p-values given in the original publications.
21479240:65	Often, when effect sizes and the corresponding p-values are presented in scientific publications, additional factors such as age, gender or specific diagnosis are included in the statistical analysis as covariates or to define subgroups, and the published results focus on the most promising subgroups.
21479240:66	Because there is some flexibility in the design of the statistical model and analysis, and the analysis with the lowest p-values for the effect of interest is more likely to be presented in a publication, the p-values in the publications may often be lower than the standardized p-values.
21479240:67	Therefore, many studies that achieve formal statistical significance at a level of 0.05 will have standardized p-values falling in the interval between 0.05 and 0.01.
21479240:68	For the weight function, this may lead to an overrepresentation of studies with p-values from the interval between 0.05 and 0.1, and may imply that when standardized p-values are used, the largest discontinuity might not be expected at a p-value of 0.05 but at a higher level.
21479240:69	Most importantly, our results indicate that initial studies face a much stronger bias than subsequent ones.
21479240:70	In line with previous observations, we find indication for the Proteus phenomenon: Early replications tend to be biased against the result of the initial publication.
21479240:71	This effect, however, is smaller than the finding that initial findings are more biased than subsequent ones.
21479240:72	Reasons and additional examples for initially inflated findings and for the Proteus phenomenon have been discussed earlier , . For evidence synthesis this is a severe problem, because when biases follow more complex patterns and differ for initial studies and subsequent ones, it is particularly difficult to correct for them.
21479240:73	In order to correct for these biases one would have to examine the behavior of the whole field as data accumulate, and then assume that this behavior can be extrapolated to new data.
21479240:74	Our approach has potential methodological caveats.
21479240:75	First, one important assumption for the weight function is the presence of discontinuities.
21479240:76	Typically, these discontinuities are justified by the salience of particular p-values, such as 0.05, in the interpretation of research findings .
21479240:77	However, as illustrated by our high-resolution model, a sufficiently large number of published findings allows using a large number of intervals, and thus a stepwise constant weight function approach can give a better picture of the shape of the weight function than alternative approaches.
21479240:78	Sensitivity to the normality assumption in the random-effects model is a potential caveat that has extensively been studied earlier . While for our analysis, non-normality in the random-effects might influence the absolute estimates for the weights, it is implausible that it affects our findings regarding the presence of the Proteus phenomenon and initial study bias.
21479240:79	Using weight functions that solely depend of the standardized effect sizes (z-value) is a further limitation, but additional variables can be easily implemented.
21479240:80	In our analysis, this is illustrated by the use of different categories of results that are assumed to be affected by different biases.
21479240:81	Distinctive categories could also be used when, for example, including data from genome-wide association studies where reporting may be by default more comprehensive.
21479240:82	We therefore believe that the potential pitfalls associated with our methodology do not distort our results.
21479240:83	The approach outlined here can be easily adjusted to analyze selective reporting for a wide range of datasets.
21479240:84	One could, for instance, analyze patterns of bias for the reporting of association between diseases and medical interventions or environmental factors.
21479240:85	Unlike for gene-disease associations, the weight functions in these fields might not necessarily be symmetric, because protective effects of such factors might face a different bias than factors that increase risks.
21479240:86	The timing of studies in other disciplines may also be slower, as compared to the rapid generation of results in genomics, and this may also affect the relative bias in replication results.
21479240:87	Moreover, the weight functions in our model can also be adjusted to capture the impact of further study-specific properties on bias.
21479240:88	Biases might, for example, depend on the internal validity of a study.
21479240:89	Reporting of design features that would allow an accurate assessment of the internal validity has not been optimal in the past genetic epidemiology literature (see ), but hopefully, with improved reporting in the future such an analysis may be reliable enough to perform in future studies.
21479240:90	One might argue that, if reasons exist for not publishing all results that are obtained, a strong bias against non-significant outcomes specifically for early studies might be reasonable.
21479240:91	Formally this can be assessed based on methods from information theory that allow quantifying the informativity of an experimental result – . Essentially, these methods allow quantifying how much an experimental observation changes our knowledge regarding a hypothesis.
21479240:92	For some fields of research, including genetic associations, the prior chances of a randomly selected genetic variant to be associated with a disease is very low . In these fields, initial positive studies are typically more informative than initial negative studies.
21479240:93	An initial finding that gene X is not associated with a particular disease offers little information, if no one expected it to be associated.
21479240:94	If full publication comes with costs, there may be some benefit to not publish such a finding.
21479240:95	However, if such a “negative” finding is not recorded anywhere even in brief, there may be a loss to other investigators who may continue spending time and effort on the same uninformative line of research.
21479240:96	If selective reporting is seen as something inevitable, a detailed analysis of its prevalence, patterns, costs, and benefits is essential to understand its dynamics and how to handle it.
21479240:97	Further analyses are required to determine whether there are forms of selective reporting that generate less severe problems in the context of evidence synthesis and may suggest how to optimize publication strategies under realistic costs and benefits.

17349062:0	Background 
Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are now known to possess cytoskeletal proteins, including tubulin components of the eukaryotic microtubules important in mitosis and the tubulin homolog FtsZ of bacteria which forms a septal Z-ring during bacterial cell division.
17349062:1	Most bacteria possess a cell division protein more closely related to FtsZ, the homolog of tubulin present almost universally within bacteria, than to the tubulin characteristic of eukaryotes [ - ].
17349062:2	Some rare bacterial species appear to lack any tubulin or FtsZ homolog at all . Both FtsZ and tubulin are significant for evolutionary cell biology since FtsZ is pivotal to cell division in most bacteria and tubulin is a cytoskeletal eukaryote signature protein central to models for origins of eukaryote cell organization . Tubulin has been confirmed to be the homolog of FtsZ at the 3D structural level by crystallography . Both proteins can polymerize into filaments, in the case of tubulin as a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits that forms the basis in vivo of eukaryote cytoskeletal microtubules central to many processes of eukaryote cell biology, and in the case of FtsZ into protofilaments in vitro and septal rings in vivo .
17349062:3	The genus Prosthecobacter is a member of the phylogenetically divergent phylum Verrucomicrobia  which forms a superphylum with other phyla Planctomycetes and Chlamydia of the domain Bacteria , and species of this genus such as P. dejongeii possess the proteins BtubA and BtubB more closely related to eukaryotic tubulin than to bacterial FtsZ . BtubA and BtubB appear to be genuine tubulins, and can form three-dimensional bundles of up to 30 protofilaments in the presence of GTP in vitro . Prosthecobacter dejongeii however, does not apparently possess FtsZ .
17349062:4	It would be expected that other members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia would also possess such a tubulin homolog e.g. if a last common ancestor of the verrucomicrobia also possessed such a homolog.
17349062:5	We therefore searched the draft genome of Verrucomicrobium spinosum for the presence of genes similar to cytoskeletal proteins such as FtsZ and tubulin, and revealed the presence of a gene coding for a protein with primary and secondary structural characteristics and evolutionary relationships consistent with closer relationship to genes for bacterial FtsZ than to those for eukaryotic tubulins.
17349062:6	Results and discussion 
A putative gene (Genbank: ) which appears to code for an ortholog of bacterial FtsZ, a cytoskeletal protein involved in cell division, was amplified to confirm the sequence from examining the draft genome of Verrucomicrobium spinosum . The translated protein VerFtsZ from this putative gene is 673 amino acids long, and application of FingerPRINTScan showed that VerFtsZ contains each of the six motifs specific to bacterial FtsZ . Consistent with this, application of GeneFIND for gene family identification showed a highly probable relationship to the FtsZ and FtsZ1 superfamily.
17349062:7	The core region of FtsZ in bacteria starts with a highly conserved isoleucine with only 14 changes at the position in 225 sequences from different organisms and ends with a recognizable version of the amino acid sequence LVITG.
17349062:8	The core region of bacterial FtsZ also contains a sequence similar to the highly conserved tubulin signature motif (PROSITE motif PS00227: ([S/A/G]GGTG [S/A/T]G).
17349062:9	VerFtsZ aligns perfectly with the conserved isoleucine of other FtsZ sequences at the start of the core region and also contains the tubulin signature – as manifested by the sequence GGGTGSG (Fig. ).
17349062:10	However, VerFtsZ shows a fairly divergent sequence at the end of the core region (Fig. ), which was observed in seven sequences of Archaea FtsZ3, as well as in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium FtsZ.
17349062:11	The C-terminal region of bacteria, which interacts directly with FtsA, lacks a classical consensus sequence due to substitutions but a sequence logo has been derived from an alignment to display the pattern of protein sequences at the C-terminal , and there is some relative conservation of amino acids at particular positions.
17349062:12	The C-terminal of VerFtsZ seemed to vary slightly from this sequence logo but it does share the highly conserved Proline position (position number 728 in Fig.
17349062:13	) with other FtsZ sequences.
17349062:14	A more detailed examination of the core region of VerFtsZ reveals significant divergence at amino acid positions otherwise conserved among other phyla.
17349062:15	There are 8 instances (red arrows in Fig.
17349062:16	) of amino acid changes to another amino acid of different physico-chemical properties from those conserved completely in the other sequences, which could imply possible structural and physiochemical significance e.g. hydrophilic to hydrophobic for the change of lysine to cysteine at position 75.
17349062:17	The amino acid serine within the tubulin signature motif (highlighted with blue arrow at position 174) presents yet another significant difference.
17349062:18	An examination of available database for the tubulin signature motif at PROSITE, and that compiled by Vaughan et al., revealed that a serine at this position is present only in the FtsZ of the alpha-proteobacterium Magnetospirillium magnetotacticum plastids of some members under Viridiplantae and the Archaea Halobacterium species NRC-1 but highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic tubulins and also in BtubA and BtubB of Prosthecobacter . 
Preliminary deduction of VerFtsZ protein structure from secondary structure comparisons using Cn3D database at NCBI resulted in reasonable alignment to the structural model of 1FSZ for FtsZ of Methanococcus jannaschii from Protein Data Bank (note that this species is synonymous with Methanocaldococcus jannaschii the name used in some other databases employed for this study).
17349062:19	In order to investigate the relationship of VerFtsZ to FtsZ of other bacteria, we performed phylogenetic analysis using the alignment in Fig which consists of a set of reference sequences of FtsZ of bacteria of different phyla.
17349062:20	The alignment contains the functional core and C-terminal domains of FtsZ while the variable spacer region has been omitted.
17349062:21	Phylogenetic analysis of an alignment including VerFtsZ and reference sequences of FtsZ from bacteria was performed using Treefinder . In the analysis (Fig. ), the long branch of VerFtsZ confirms its divergence from the other representatives of FtsZ among the domain Bacteria with no apparent implication of horizontal gene transfer from any existing bacterial phyla.
17349062:22	VerFtsZ displays lower similarity to FtsZs of other Bacterial phyla than the similarity of the FtsZs of any of those phylum representatives to the FtsZs from any other Bacterial phylum.
17349062:23	For example, when calculated using an alignment without the variable spacer region, the FtsZ of Aquifex aeolicus widely considered a deep-branching bacterium, exhibits a similarity to VerFtsZ of only 36.8%, yet shows a similarity of at least 42% to the other representative FtsZs, and other Bacterial FtsZs often display greater similarity to any other Bacterial FtsZs than to VerFtsZ.
17349062:24	In other Bacteria, the ftsZ gene is known to form part of the dcw gene cluster which possesses other genes coding for proteins concerned with cell division coordinated with FtsZ in the divisome, such as FtsA, FtsI, FtsW, FtsQ and several genes concerned with cell wall synthesis such as the peptidoglycan synthesis mur genes murG murD and murE . V.spinosum contains an almost complete set of proteins of the dcw gene cluster (Fig. ), with only MraZ and FtsL missing from the cluster.
17349062:25	The genes for MurB, MurC and EnvA are absent from the V. spinosum dcw cluster but corresponding sequences are present elsewhere in the genome of this species.
17349062:26	The order of the genes in the dcw cluster in V. spinosum can be seen to be similar to the gene order of the dcw clusters of bacteria in several distinct phyla (as represented by Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Thermotoga maritima and Chlamydia trachomatis in Fig.
17349062:27	members of the phyla Proteobacteria Firmicutes Thermotoga and Chlamydia respectively).
17349062:28	Despite sharing membership of a potential superphylum with Chlamydia trachomatis the dcw cluster of V. spinosum like E. coli and B. subtilis possesses FtsQ, FtsA and FtsZ in that same order, while these are missing from the dcw cluster of C. trachomatis an organism known to possess no FtsZ.
17349062:29	The organization of the ftsZ gene of V. spinosum within a gene cluster known to be concerned with formation of a septation divisome and related cell wall synthesis in E. coli suggests that the verrucomicrobial FtsZ protein also participates in a multi-protein divisome organizing septum synthesis.
17349062:30	Conclusion 
It is clear from the above analysis that VerFtsZ of the verrucomicrobia member Verrucomicrobium spinosum is a true ortholog of other FtsZ sequences from Bacteria, and differs markedly from the tubulin homologs BtubA and BtubB of Prosthecobacter dejongeii . BtubA and BtubB have been shown to form a similar heterodimer to αβ-tubulin and seem to be bacterial tubulins fundamentally distinct from FtsZ while sharing the features common to the FtsZ-tubulin family .
17349062:31	This difference between the V. spinosum FtsZ and the P. dejongeii tubulins is of considerable evolutionary interest, since clearly from our analysis, these two markedly different proteins occur in two species within the same phylum Verrucomicrobia of domain Bacteria.
17349062:32	One would expect from phylogenetic considerations that members of the same monophyletic phylum level group within the Bacteria would possess orthologs of only FtsZ or tubulin but that both of these closely related but quite distinct orthologs would not be present in the same phylum.
17349062:33	The occurrence of both FtsZ and tubulin homologs within different genera of the same phylum can be explained either by a gene loss and replacement by a lateral gene transfer event or by a close relationship of the FtsZ and tubulins found in this phylum to a last common ancestor possessing a protein with similarities to both.
17349062:34	It has been pointed out from structural considerations that horizontal gene transfer is one explanation for the origin of the tubulin homologs BtubB and BtubA in P. dejongeii . 
The unexpected occurrence of both FtsZ and tubulin cytoskeletal proteins in one bacterial phylum could be explained in several ways.
17349062:35	Both proteins could have been present in the common ancestor of Verrucomicrobium and Prosthecobacter and then may have been differentially lost or have significantly diverged.
17349062:36	Alternatively, horizontal transfer from proto-eukaryotes or eukaryotes to Prosthecobacter may account for tubulin in this genus and this is supported by genome data suggesting a largely bacterial nature for P.dejongeii genes . 
Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii form a relatively shallow clade within the verrucomicrobia according to other genes.
17349062:37	The 16S rRNA similarity between Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii as well as all other species of Prosthecobacter is quite high at 91%, relative to the similarity of members of both these genera to deeper-branching species of verrucomicrobia such as Victivallis vadensis (76% in each case) or Opitutus terrae (80%).
17349062:38	This should be more compatible with a late lateral gene transfer of tubulin genes into Prosthecobacter species than an ancient gene duplication in a verrucomicrobial ancestor (since retention of tubulin in both members of a resulting lineage or clade within verrucomicrobia would be expected if inherited vertically from a common ancestor).
17349062:39	Lateral transfer of tubulin genes seems more likely than transfer of FtsZ genes since a whole dcw cluster would have to be transferred.
17349062:40	Loss and replacement of a complete multi-gene cell division mechanism necessary for viability of a cell population seems an unlikely scenario in case of one incorporating either FtsZ or tubulin, but the similarity of ancestral FtZs and tubulins could have meant such ancestral proteins could have been easily interchangeable within a common gene organization.
17349062:41	Otherwise a version of the 'complexity hypothesis' relating to cell division as a complex system of interacting proteins suggests that it would be difficult to replace FtsZ within a dcw cluster with a more evolved tubulin.
17349062:42	From existing draft genome sequence, it appears that the significant gene for the FtsA protein important for interaction with FtsZ is missing from P. dejongeii though genes of the dcw cluster concerned with peptidoglycan synthesis such as murD are present.
17349062:43	P. dejongeii also seems to have a gene for FtsW, known to interact with peptidoglycan synthesis proteins.
17349062:44	Significantly, the tubulin genes in this species are organized in an operon along with a kinesin-like gene, suggesting they are not a part of the dcw cluster . Co-expression of btuba and btubb in E. coli results in either prominent rods running along the cell length or loose spirals so this suggest that these proteins by themselves may be able to form cytoskeletal filaments in vivo . 
Tubulin genes may be found in other verrucomicrobia branching more deeply than Prosthecobacter species within the verrucomicrobia.
17349062:45	This is suggested by the report via anti-tubulin antibodies of tubulin in the 'epixenosomes', verrucomicrobial symbionts of marine ciliate protozoan Euplotidium . Epixenosomes are members of subdivision 4 of the phylum Verrucomicrobia  along with the cultured Opitutus terrae . The distribution of genes for both tubulins and FtsZ must be determined in a wider selection of verrucomicrobia among all 5 subdivisions distinguished, e.g. cultured members of genera Opitutus and Chthoniobacter in order to determine an optimal basis for further investigations of their evolution via data from genomics and cell biology.
17349062:46	Since genome data for Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii is only in draft form so far, there is a possibility that either or both of these species possess both FtsZ and tubulin, and this should be confirmed or refuted by annotation of completed genomes for these species.
17349062:47	Discovery of a verrucomicrobial FtsZ in at least one genus and species combined with our existing knowledge of a tubulin in another verrucomicrobial genus reveals that two markedly different members of the tubulin-FtsZ cytoskeletal protein family occur within the same clade of the same bacterial phylum.
17349062:48	This result may be of potential significance for our understanding of eukaryote and Bacterial cytoskeleton evolution, since such occurrence may suggest new models for cytoskeletal protein evolution e.g. derivation of both FtsZ and tubulin from an ancestral protein or proteins present in a Bacterial ancestor, or lateral transfer of cytoskeletal genes between domains at early stages in their evolution.
17349062:49	Members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia may hold a key to the ancient molecular evolutionary stages by which tubulins and FtsZ's diverged and differentiated, or alternatively, the trace of an early event in the gene transfer network between prokaryotes and eukaryotes which may have preserved an early 'snapshot' of the evolution of eukaryote cytoskeletal proteins.
17349062:50	Such models may be testable via a combination of further genomic and bioinformatic analysis of existing and newly discovered verrucomicrobia.

15892883:0	Background 
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common and are reported within three months by almost every other adult in Western countries (UK, Sweden, USA, Australia) [ - ].
15892883:1	(The abbreviations used in this manuscript are explained in the Additional File.)
15892883:2	The most common symptoms are gastroesophageal reflux symptoms/disease (GERS) and dyspepsia originating from the upper GI tract, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) from the lower GI tract.
15892883:3	Prevalence rates are reported to be 25% for both GERS and dyspepsia and about 12% for IBS .
15892883:4	Although intermittent, these disorders may linger in many sufferers . The total cost of dyspepsia to society, with and without peptic ulcer disease, GERS and IBS, is considerable . Thus, these disorders constitute a major public health problem.
15892883:5	Dyspepsia without peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (or any other organic GI disease) is called functional dyspepsia . In a Swedish population-based upper endoscope study, the prevalence of dyspepsia was 38% and the prevalence of PUD 4%, with about a quarter of the PUD subjects having no GI symptoms . Thus, the vast majority of those reporting dyspepsia in the population can be expected to have functional dyspepsia.
15892883:6	IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder .
15892883:7	Although functional dyspepsia and IBS are considered separate disorders , many subjects report concomitant symptoms thought to originate from both the upper and the lower the GI tract .
15892883:8	Also, sufferers may experience a change in predominant symptom profile over time between dyspepsia and IBS, but much less towards GERS . This means that dyspepsia and IBS sufferers probably have common aspects of both pathophysiology and health care seeking behavior.
15892883:9	Furthermore GERS, in a majority of cases, has a proven (non-functional) acid-related etiology . Accordingly, it seems reasonable to exclude subjects with only GERS symptoms from the functional definition and to investigate the burden on society of functional dyspepsia and IBS taken together.
15892883:10	We thus label these conditions as functional gastrointestinal disorders or FGID.
15892883:11	A minority of subjects with FGID (5–20%) are reported to visit a doctor quarterly for their complaints . On the other hand, up to half of those with FGID never see a doctor despite prolonged symptoms . For IBS, the proportion is even higher, up to 80 % . Thus, GI patient-based data will not cover all aspects of morbidity.
15892883:12	Moreover, it has been reported previously that most patients' sick leave is due to disorders other than their abdominal complaints.
15892883:13	Only 23% of those subjects with abdominal pain who were on sick leave stated that abdominal pain was the cause of their absenteeism . 
There are prior cross-sectional population-based point prevalence studies on GI co-morbidity [ - ].
15892883:14	However, there is a lack of knowledge of the co-morbidity of subjects with proven chronic/long lasting/persistent FGID and its impact on health care seeking behaviour due to GI symptoms.
15892883:15	The aim of this study was to compare the co-morbidity and its relation to health care seeking behaviour among non-patients with persistent FGID with those who are persistently GI symptom free, in a randomly-selected adult Swedish population.
15892883:16	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
This study shows that among subjects with longstanding FGID, there is a remarkably high prevalence of psychological illness and also of non-GI somatic complaints.
15892883:17	These are present regardless of whether the subjects have consulted their doctor about their GI problems, and are more severe in subjects with persistent FGID.
15892883:18	Although FGID was more common in women, the consultation rates in sufferers were similar for males and females and were not age-related.
15892883:19	Only about a quarter of the sufferers had never consulted their doctor.
15892883:20	We consider that our findings can be generalized to the whole population, as the study groups were sampled from a well-defined and thoroughly investigated population, most of whom had participated in prior studies . The original study base was formed in 1988 from the Swedish National Population register, which guarantees complete coverage of all citizens.
15892883:21	There were no differences in age, gender or education level between the study and the sample groups or between the population samples from 1988 and 1995.
15892883:22	Also, the proportions of those reporting symptoms explicable in terms of an organic disease have been shown to be insignificant . Thus, the FGID subjects and the symptom-free subjects would seem to be representative.
15892883:23	The validity of the research tool is a potential source of bias.
15892883:24	However, for symptom reporting, only well-validated questionnaires were used.
15892883:25	Both the ASQ and the CSQ have been adequately validated [ - ].
15892883:26	The psychological illness factor identified in this study embraces symptoms of both "neurotic" and "personality" dimensions, listed in Table and the outcome seems plausible.
15892883:27	The questionnaire used to assess medical knowledge was simple and straightforward, with kappa values per question 1 = 0.70, 2 = 0.89, 3 = 0.47, 4 = 0.78, 5 = 0.80, 6 = 0.70 when repeated within a week, considered acceptable for all with some reservation in the 0.47 case .
15892883:28	The definitions of dyspepsia and IBS used in this study were those used in the original study from 1988 , when the Rome II criteria  were unavailable.
15892883:29	We opted to retain our original study definitions despite ongoing changes.
15892883:30	Our definition of dyspepsia was more restricted in terms of symptoms than the Rome II definition, but wider in terms of abdominal location, as not only epigastric but also mid abdominal symptoms were included.
15892883:31	The IBS definition used was in accordance with the Rome II criteria . Consequently, we consider the overall prevalence of FGID in this study and the concordance on an individual level to be applicable within today's definitions . 
Subjects with FGID were on average younger than controls without FGID, which may be expected as the prevalence of dyspepsia and IBS is generally higher in younger age groups .
15892883:32	This study was not a case control study, however, but a study of all subjects with FGID and SSF within the cohort.
15892883:33	Any differences caused by this grouping strategy were controlled for in the analysis by gender- and age-adjusted logistic regression.
15892883:34	There was a particular association between FGID and psychological illness, although "fibromyalgia-like" symptoms (ache and fatigue)  and other somatic complaints were also common.
15892883:35	Previous outpatient studies have shown that IBS is associated with psychiatric illnesses such as depression , dysthymia  and anxiety , and similar findings are reported for dyspepsia . Greater mental pathology has been reported for consulters, i.e. patients, than non-consulters with IBS [ , ], but this has not been demonstrated convincingly in dyspepsia subjects . 
Healthcare seeking behaviour is complex and until now it has been studied largely in patient samples.
15892883:36	Nyrén et al . found that patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia had an excessive need for sick leave compared with ulcer patients, but that the predominant reason for leave was related to musculoskeletal rather than abdominal symptoms . Kettell et al .  found that severity of abdominal pain and anxiety about the seriousness of their condition were important factors in patients consulting for IBS . There seem to be no differences in the use of healthcare services or co-morbidity status between the year before and the year after diagnosis of IBS .
15892883:37	Although this study was focused on total co-morbidity, in terms of consultation, other factors associated with FGID consultation were also considered.
15892883:38	The total consultation pattern for the subjects will be published elsewhere.
15892883:39	In essence, effective treatment of patients with FGID involves not only addressing GI discomfort, but also considering mental and somatic complaints such as depression and exhaustion.
15892883:40	Conclusion 
In the present study, psychological illness proved to be an important co-morbidity factor among subjects with FGID, and the severities of the two were linked.
15892883:41	We cannot conclude anything about the cause of the relationship.
15892883:42	The presence of psychological illness was also associated with a greater need for medical consultation.
15892883:43	Fear of life-threatening illness has been reported to be an important reason for consultation in FGID , and this worry and anxiety needs to be taken into account when attempting to manage FGID successfully.
15892883:44	Somatic co-morbidity was found to be a less important reason for consultation, although a high proportion of subjects with FGID (77%) in our study were taking analgesics while only 32% used specific gastrointestinal medication.

20591912:0	Aims 
The overall aim of the recently introduced national newborn programme is to identify
   infants at risk of sickle cell disease to allow early detection and to minimise
   deaths and complications through early treatment and care.
20591912:1	Screening is now offered
   to all babies in England irrespective of ethnicity at 5–8 days
   of age as part of the pre-existing newborn dried blood-spot screening programme;
   implementation is planned for Scotland in 2010.
20591912:2	We report the frequency of suspected
   disease rates for different parts of the country and for the first time we report
   newborn carrier data broken down by ethnicity using the categories recorded on the
   dried bloodspot (Guthrie) card.
20591912:3	This is important information for those who have to
   counsel such families.
20591912:4	The reported carrier rate for England as a whole is 15/1000.
20591912:5	The frequency of diagnosis of sickle cell disease suggests that it should be given a
   higher priority in medical and nursing education and in NHS service planning and
   provision.
20591912:6	The scale of need for genetic counselling arising from this programme is
   also emphasised.
20591912:7	Methods 
Screening for sickle cell disease was introduced in England between September 2003
   and July 2006, building on the existing patchy screening arrangements which covered
   about 15% of England (in parts of London and the West Midlands).
20591912:8	The policy adopted by the National Screening Committee (NSC) was to introduce
   universal resident based screening of all infants using the bloodspot card and to
   discontinue catchment based cord blood samples.
20591912:9	The newborn laboratory service providing the screening in England now
   consists of 13 centralised biochemistry newborn screening
   laboratories—each screening between 25 000 and
   110 000 babies a year.
20591912:10	For sickle cell screening, second line testing of
   all positive results is performed, either within the screening laboratory, or by a
   specialist haematology laboratory within the same hospital trust or elsewhere.
20591912:11	Two
   methods of analysis are applied to all screen-positive results obtained from dried
   blood spot samples to ensure high specificity: either high performance liquid
   chromatography or iso-electric focussing (further details are included in our
   laboratory handbook).
20591912:12	In addition to
   screening for sickle cell disease, these biochemistry laboratories perform newborn
   screening for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis and medium
   chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCADD).
20591912:13	The screening programme specifies the conditions to be screened for and recommends
   specific methods to be used.
20591912:14	The conditions
   screened for because of the potential benefit are: sickle cell anaemia (Hb SS), Hb
   SC disease, Hb S/ β thalassaemia, Hb S/D Punjab
   and Hb S/O Arab.
20591912:15	Hb S/hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin is also
   included as it needs to be distinguished from Hb SS and
   S/ β or δ β 
   thalassaemia although it is not in itself a condition for which there is proven
   benefit in screening.
20591912:16	Currently the UK NSC does not support screening for
    β thalassaemia.
20591912:17	A detailed implementation plan was developed which included training of staff
   responsible for taking samples (predominantly midwives) and providing laboratory
   set-up costs, development of materials for parents, recruitment of counsellors and
   funding of laboratories as described elsewhere.
20591912:18	Standards for the linked newborn and
   antenatal programme and for the overall
   bloodspot programme are available in various
   publications.
20591912:19	The NSC supported the recommendation by the programme that, in line with pre-existing
   practice in areas already undertaking newborn screening, carriers of the main
   haemoglobins including S, C, D, E and others should be reported to parents.
20591912:20	This was
   a controversial area with many clinical geneticists considering that this
   information should be withheld, but the debate has helped to move thinking forward
   on this issue.
20591912:21	The UK decision is in line with the recent review undertaken in the
   USA and takes account of the fact that the aim of the programme is to detect infants
   affected by conditions for which there is good evidence of benefit.
20591912:22	Screening for carriers is not the primary aim of the programme, but these are
   detected using our chosen technology.
20591912:23	In the UK it was not considered ethical to
   withhold this information if parents wished to have it.
20591912:24	Carriers of the common haemoglobin variants
   (S, C, D and E) are therefore reported to parents with specific supporting materials
   aimed of parents with an infant rather than adults considering a pregnancy.
20591912:25	Counselling is offered to ensure parents
   understand that their child is healthy and the difference between carrier state and
   disease, the distinction between the S carrier status (which is clinically important
   to know) and other carrier statuses (which are unlikely to be clinically important
   but have genetic relevance).
20591912:26	Unlike antenatal
   screening, newborn screening methods do not reliably identify all thalassaemia
   carriers although parents who are carriers often want to know this information.
20591912:27	Recently published work has suggested that some β 
   thalassaemia carriers may be detected by their low levels of Hb A at birth.
20591912:28	Demographic data are recorded on the blood spot card by the midwife who takes the
   sample, including ethnic data selected from a table printed on the back of the card.
20591912:29	This ethnic data field is not completed in all cases and has not been available from
   one laboratory for the period reported here.
20591912:30	Data are collected from all laboratories, checked and discussed with the providing
   laboratory to keep inconsistencies to a minimum.
20591912:31	The data are used to assist in
   planning counselling and clinical services and to inform antenatal prevalence
   estimates and local screening policy and service planning.
20591912:32	The time period of the
   data collections is the two financial years of 2005/06 and 2006/2007.
20591912:33	Results 
The prevalence of screening results indicating likely sickle cell disease (screen
   positive results) varies widely.
20591912:34	It ranges from 3 per 1000 in South East London (ie, about 1:330 babies have a screen
   positive result) to 0.12 per 1000 in Cumbria and Lancashire—a 25-fold
   variation in prevalence.
20591912:35	Within London the prevalence is highest in South East
   London at 3/1000 and lowest in North West London at 1/1000.
20591912:36	Other areas with higher
   rates of 0.4–0.5/1000 include Leicester and Northants, Bedfordshire,
   Birmingham, Essex and Greater Manchester.
20591912:37	Overall babies recorded as Black African
   make up 61% of all the sickle cell disease suspected results despite representing
   only 4% of total births.
20591912:38	Overall screen positive disease prevalence rate is 1:2000
   for England.
20591912:39	shows that combined carrier rates
   also vary widely by ethnicity from 1.85 per 1000 (1:540) in those babies recorded as
   ‘White British’ to 145 per 1000 (1:7) for ‘Black
   African’ babies.
20591912:40	, showing refusal rates for screening,
   shows that several populations such as the ‘any other white
   background’ (1:940), ‘Black Caribbean’ (1:840) and
   ‘not stated’ (1:880) populations appear to have a
   significantly higher rate of refusal of screening than the ‘White
   British’ (1:3150) category with CIs not overlapping the ‘White
   British’ category.
20591912:41	Overall about 300 refusals are documented each year,
   and for these cases a blank card is sent to the laboratory to ensure that this
   information is documented on all records so that a test may still be performed if
   clinical suspicion is raised or if the child subsequently becomes ill.
20591912:42	Almost
   exclusively refusals are for screening for all five conditions and not specifically
   a refusal for sickle cell disease screening.
20591912:43	To date, to our knowledge, none of
   these refusals have been babies already identified by antenatal screening as at high
   risk of being affected.
20591912:44	For infants at a 1:4 or higher risk the clinical policy is
   to offer liquid blood sample testing in advance of the bloodspot screen which is
   still offered (see page 4 of the programme laboratory handbook).
20591912:45	shows that different ethnic groups
   have different patterns of carrier rates, with haemoglobin D being predominantly
   seen in the Indian and Pakistani populations and haemoglobin E seen in the
   Bangladeshi population.
20591912:46	Conclusion 
These results from the newborn screening programme provide useful objective
   information, both about the frequency of these conditions and the carrier state and
   their variable geographic and ethnic distribution across England.
20591912:47	They give ratios
   of conditions and carrier frequencies by ethnic group which can be used by the
   programme to refine counselling information for individuals and couples as recently
   recommended by Kai et al . 
   They are also useful to target and plan services and public information.
20591912:48	The limitations of the data are that it is based on ethnicity data ascertained by
   midwives and recorded on the bloodspot card rather than on a detailed family origin
   questionnaire, and also that ethnic data were not recorded in about 13% of samples.
20591912:49	Despite this, the overall pattern and distribution of disease and carrier rates
   expected is clearly shown.
20591912:50	A second limitation of the data is that these are
   screening and not diagnostic results, but as reported elsewhere the screening
   methods used are highly specific and sensitive, and results are unlikely to be
   significantly changed when confirmatory tests are completed.
20591912:51	None of these limitations are likely to materially affect the main findings of the
   general prevalence of the condition—now about 1:2000 affected births in
   England: it is as common as cystic fibrosis.
20591912:52	The significant contribution that the
   Black African, rather than the African-Caribbean population makes to the disease is
   of note.
20591912:53	The data also show the significant burden that these conditions are likely
   to place on the London NHS.
20591912:54	These objective figures should replace previous estimates of the scale of these
   conditions which are now out of date.
20591912:55	They suggest that the management and care of
   haemoglobinopathies as a long term condition needs to move from its
   ‘orphan’ status into the mainstream of the NHS commissioning
   and clinical agenda as an important addition to the inequalities in healthcare
   agenda.
20591912:56	The huge variation in the condition by ethnicity shown by these figures
   arguably explains why the condition has not received the attention it merits as the
   groups affected are often marginalised within UK society.
20591912:57	A welcome recent
   development which may be helping to raise the profile of these conditions in the NHS
   is the establishment of an All Party Parliamentary group.
20591912:58	The other issue that these figures raise is the frequency of the carrier state and
   the ongoing challenge to record such information accurately, in primary care
   records, so that it is available when needed and repeat testing is avoided.
20591912:59	In the
   case of S carrier status, this is important information for parents and children as
   sickling does occur, albeit rarely, under stress of deoxygenation such as during
   surgery, at high altitude and during extreme physical activity.
20591912:60	This information is not solely relevant
   for reproductive reasons but also for clinical reasons, and in a child this latter
   point is the important issue.
20591912:61	We hope that by presenting objective information, which should be read alongside
   other information, the clinical community responsible for education of future
   clinicians and for developing services will act to support the obvious clinical
   needs shown, and will ensure that genetic issues are considered alongside clinical
    needs.

It is generally accepted that the cadherin–catenin cell adhesion complex plays fundamental roles not only in the formation of cell–cell junctions but also in the morphogenesis of tissue and organs, dependent on its strong state of cell–cell adhesion activity and its interaction with the actin-based cytoskeleton.
10087272:1	We identified three distinct functional domains of α-catenin required for the interaction with vinculin, for direct binding to ZO-1, and for the adhesion activity of E-cadherin–α-catenin fusion molecules (Fig.
10087272:2	B).
10087272:3	Here, we will discuss possible functions of each domain of α-catenin and the relationship between the cell adhesion activity and the interaction of cadherin–catenin complex with the cytoskeleton.
10087272:4	We will also discuss the difference of α-catenin function in nonepithelial and in epithelial cells.
21562647:0	Introduction 
Cancer invasion is a critical step of metastasis, which is the most important property of cancer cells.
21562647:1	() The blockade or prevention of this process by drugs and food factors will lead to prolongation of the life span of host.
21562647:2	In our previous study, some food factors such as l-ascorbic acid, carotenoids and resveratrol have anti-invasive effect against a rat ascites hepatoma cell line of AH109A.
21562647:3	(–) These compounds possessing antioxidative activity led us to assume that their inhibitory effect on invasion is mediated through scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS).
21562647:4	Tumor cells are known to produce a large amount of ROS than do normal cells.
21562647:5	() ROS may be a key mediator for tumor metastasis including migration and invasion.
21562647:6	(,) In fact, ROS increased invasive activity of AH109A cells.
21562647:7	() Molecular mechanisms for metastasis promotion by ROS were reportedly related to activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through various tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC).
21562647:8	() PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases and is classified into three groups, such as classical PKC (α, β, γ), novel PKC (δ, ε, η, θ), and atypical PKC (ζ, ι/λ).
21562647:9	PKC is known to regulate a variety of cell functions including proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration.
21562647:10	(,)
Tocopherols differ in the number of methyl groups present on the chroman head and are known as one of lipid-soluble vitamins.
21562647:11	PKC is known as a main intracellular target of α-tocopherol.
21562647:12	(,) Moreover, tocopherols have antioxidative activity and anti-proliferative action on some tumor cells.
21562647:13	(,) However, little is known about the effects of tocopherols on the invasion of cancer cells and their modes of action.
21562647:14	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tocopherols on the invasion as well as the proliferation of AH109A hepatoma cells and to clarify their modes of action.
21562647:15	Materials and Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In the present study, we examined in vitro effects of α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols on the proliferation and invasion of AH109A cells and found that four tocopherols all inhibited both the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells.
21562647:16	Higher concentrations (10–50 µM) of α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols significantly inhibited the proliferation by 20% (Fig.
21562647:17	A–D) and the invasion by 47% (Fig.
21562647:18	E–H) as compared with the corresponding controls.
21562647:19	Previous studies also demonstrated that tocopherols at higher concentrations in the range of 10–50 µM inhibited proliferative activities of different cancer cells such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma and glioma cells.
21562647:20	(,,) In case of AH109A hepatoma cells, anti-proliferative activities of lower concentrations (1–5 µM) of tocopherols, except for α-tocopherol (Fig.
21562647:21	A), were not statistically significant as compared with untreated AH109A cells (Fig.
21562647:22	B–D), but four tocopherols at 1–5 µM significantly suppressed the invasion (Fig.
21562647:23	E–H).
21562647:24	At the lower concentrations, their inhibitory effects were more prominent on the invasion than on the proliferation.
21562647:25	In the present study, α-tocopherol was demonstrated for the first time to most strongly prevent the invasion of AH109A cells among four tocopherols (Fig.  ).
21562647:26	Moreover, present study showed that the order of anti-invasive activity of the four tocopherols was α-tocopherol > δ-tocopherol ⩾ β-tocopherol = γ-tocopherol.
21562647:27	In our previous studies, carotenoids, fish oil and theanine, for instance, did not show any anti-proliferative activity but did anti-invasive activity against AH109A cells at lower concentrations, (,,) indicating that the effects on the proliferation and invasion of AH109A cells depend on the properties of food components.
21562647:28	As tocopherols are known to have antioxidative activity, we have employed a ROS-stimulated invasion assay system.
21562647:29	α-Tocopherol, which showed the most potent anti-invasive activity, suppressed the invasion of AH109A cells cultured in a ROS-generating system with HX-XO (Fig.
21562647:30	A).
21562647:31	The HX-XO system is reported to generate both superoxide anion (O 2•−) and H 2O 2, and finally hydroxyl radical ( •OH) via the Fenton reaction.
21562647:32	() Interestingly, α-tocopherol (1 µM) did not decrease the intracellular peroxide level irrespectively of the presence of the ROS-generating system (Fig.  B).
21562647:33	In the similar system, other antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (62.5 µM) and resveratorol (50 µM) were reported to distinctly decrease the intracellular peroxide level in AH109A hepatoma cells treated with exogenous ROS.
21562647:34	(,) Although α-tocopherol was reported to have most potent antioxidative reaction rate in vitro () it did not affect the intracellular peroxide level in cytoplasm (Fig.
21562647:35	B).
21562647:36	Thus, the effect of α-tocopherol against the invasion might not be mediated by antioxidative function under the present experimental conditions.
21562647:37	ROS-induced oxidative stress may be implicated in adhesion, migration and invasion of tumor cells, and also intracellular ROS play critical roles in mediating cross talk of PKC with integrin.
21562647:38	() Multiple cysteine residues within PKC can be oxidatively activated by ROS.
21562647:39	() As activation of PKC by ROS was thought to be involved in ROS-stimulated invasion, we examined the contribution of PKC in invasion of AH109A cells using PKC inhibitor and PKC activator.
21562647:40	GF, an ATP competitive inhibitor of PKC, decreased the invasive activity of AH109A cells at the concentration (1 µM) where GF exerted no influence on the proliferation (Fig.
21562647:41	A and B).
21562647:42	PMA, a PKC activator like corresponding action to diacylglycerol (DAG), increased the invasion of AH109A cells (Fig.
21562647:43	D), although it weakly reduced the proliferation (Fig.
21562647:44	C).
21562647:45	Thus, PKC is confirmed to be important in the AH109A invasion.
21562647:46	In addition, cPKC and nPKC including DAG- and PMA-binding domain would play an important mediation role in the invasion process.
21562647:47	Using the invasion assay with PMA, α-tocopherol (1 µM) was found to suppress the PMA-induced invasive activity of AH109A cells (Fig.
21562647:48	A).
21562647:49	From these results, the inhibitory effect of α-tocopherols on the ROS-induced invasion of AH109A cells was suggested to be attributable to the inhibition of PKC activity.
21562647:50	Activated PKC is reported to translocate from cytoplasm to membrane by PMA, () suggesting that activated PKC is most attractive target of α-tocopherol.
21562647:51	We therefore tried to directly measure PKC activity.
21562647:52	From an experiment on time-dependency of PKC activation by PMA (data not shown), we decided to expose cells to PMA for 3 min.
21562647:53	As shown in Fig.
21562647:54	B, α-tocopherol inhibited PMA-stimulated PKC activity.
21562647:55	Furthermore, the rise in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in AH109A cells treated with PMA was downregulated by α-tocopherol (Fig.
21562647:56	C and D).
21562647:57	PMA and growth factor activate the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK signal pathway.
21562647:58	() Our present results are in consistent with the previous findings.
21562647:59	In addition, downstream effectors of PKC activations on the invasion of tumor cells resulted in increasing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secretion.
21562647:60	() We have already reported that the HGF-c-Met system is strongly implicated in the motility and invasion of AH109A cells.
21562647:61	() Treatment of AH109A cells with ROS seems to accelerate the secretion of HGF and invasive activity in an autocrine fashion.
21562647:62	() Thus, ROS-PKC-HGF-c-Met system is thought to be involved in the invasive activity of AH109A cells.
21562647:63	In the present study, α-tocopherol was demonstrated to suppress ROS- and hence activated PKC-induced invasion of AH109A cells.
21562647:64	These results suggest that the suppressive action of α-tocopherol on the ROS-induced invasion is due to its inhibitory property against PKC activity rather than its ROS-scavenging property.
21562647:65	As β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols at 1 µM also canceled the PMA-induced elevation in the invasive activity (data not shown), effects of β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols on the rise in the ROS-induced invasion, the PMA-induced PKC activity and ERK1/2 phosphorylation remain to be elucidated.
21562647:66	In summary, α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols showed more notable inhibitory effect on the invasion of AH109A cells than that on the proliferation.
21562647:67	α-Tocopherol (1) showed the strongest anti-invasive activity among four tocopherols at a low concentration of 1 µM, (2) suppressed the rise in ROS-induced invasion of AH109A without scavenging intracellular peroxides, (3) suppressed the PMA-induced rise in the invasive activity of AH109A, (4) suppressed the rise in the PMA-induced PKC activation in AH109A and (5) suppressed the rise in the PMA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation of PKC downstream in AH109A cells.
20033124:0	Introduction 
Wine represents one of the most important products of plant domestication during the development of human civilisation in western Eurasia.
20033124:1	It is intimately bound up with the expansion of agriculture, trade and commerce and is also important in socioreligious, cultural and political aspects of many societies, particularly around the Mediterranean.
20033124:2	Winemaking enabled humans to produce a beverage which was the most widespread drug and medicine of antiquity, a drug upon which economies and communities were built (Bassermann-Jordan ; Olmo ).
20033124:3	Archaeobotanical evidence of Vitis sp.
20033124:4	consists principally of waterlogged, mineralised and charred seeds.
20033124:5	Morphological differences can only tentatively distinguish wild and cultivated subspecies (Mangafa and Kotsakis ).
20033124:6	Furthermore, in many cases, this discrimination relies more on indirect evidence, such as the absence of wild Vitis in the geographic area, or on the archaeological context and the time period.
20033124:7	Vitis seeds and in particular those that are waterlogged store biomolecular information, which can provide greater detail on viticulture diffusion and the wine trade.
20033124:8	Genetics have advanced our understanding of crop domestication, for example, studies of modern grapes have revealed changes brought about by human selection (Meredith ; This et al. ; Arroyo-García et al. ; Vouillamoz and Grando ).
20033124:9	Ancient DNA (aDNA) recovered from archaeological plant residues has also begun to play a role by shaping our understanding of past grape diffusion (Manen et al. ).
20033124:10	With their morphology and structure specifically designed to store genetic information, seeds are a promising target for studies on ancient biomolecules, in some cases germinating after centuries (Sallon et al. ). In grape seeds in particular, protection is further enhanced by the hard coat and the high concentrations of antioxidant molecules (Yilmaz and Toledo ).
20033124:11	Remarkable preservation of lipids and nucleic acids has been reported in 1,400-year-old radish ( Raphanus ) seeds by O'Donoghue et al..
20033124:12	Previous work on blackberry ( Rubus fruticosus ) seeds and crab apple ( Malus silvestris ) pips from York revealed that the preservation is good for lignin and cellulose but only limited for proteins (McCobb et al. ). 
In this study, we have undertaken a combined DNA/carbohydrate/protein analysis of several ancient grape seeds.
20033124:13	We explored the survival of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifiable nuclear DNA (nuDNA) using five microsatellite loci in order to tentatively compare ancient samples with modern grape varieties.
20033124:14	Such information can help to clarify ambiguities about indigenous cultivation and commercial trade of grapes and wine in two different archaeological contexts: a seventh–eighth century A.D., Byzantine rural settlement in the ‘heel’ of the Italian peninsula, near the town of Supersano (Salento area, Lecce, Italy; Arthur ; Arthur et al. ), and a late medieval, fourteenth–fifteenth century A.D., site on Low Petergate, in York city centre (northern England; Akeret et al. ; Reeves ).
20033124:15	The present-day climate in York is unsuitable for outdoor grape cultivation, but the chronology of the site, between the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (Lamb ; Bradley et al. ), does not completely exclude the possibility that viticulture was practised in the area at that time.
20033124:16	Considering that in ancient samples DNA survival may be related to general biomolecular preservation, we also analysed carbohydrates and proteins from the same samples of archaeological grape seeds, adopting multiple approaches.
20033124:17	Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) was used to investigate carbohydrate preservation.
20033124:18	Protein degradation was estimated observing amino acid composition and racemisation and by direct sequencing of preserved peptides.
20033124:19	The protein component represents an important indicator of seed and grain quality.
20033124:20	Pioneering studies on archaeological cereal seeds (Derbyshire et al. ; Shewry et al. ) suggested that the investigation of proteins from ancient grains could aid in understanding of plant domestication, but this work was hampered by the prevailing technology of that time.
20033124:21	However, the application of mass spectrometry to fossil bone samples has enabled the identification and sequencing of single ancient proteins, namely osteocalcin (Nielsen-Marsh et al. ; Humpula et al. ) and collagen (Asara et al. ; Schweitzer et al. ; but see also Buckley et al. ).
20033124:22	Recently Solazzo et al. were able to identify protein remains in archaeological potsherds, whilst Hollemeyer et al. used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to analyse some fragments of the 5,300-year-old Tyrolean mummy's clothing.
20033124:23	The integration of a range of technical improvements has enabled rapid and sensitive identification of proteins present in small and complex biological samples.
20033124:24	To test the potential of this ensemble of technologies for the analysis of archaeobotanical samples and to characterise the effects of long-term protein degradation processes, we have extracted and analysed the proteins from ancient grape seeds, using both electrospray ionisation (ESI) and MALDI.

Conclusions 
In addition to observing good preservation of the lignin- and cellulose-derived compounds (as detected by Py-GC-MS), peptide sequencing allowed us to identify several ancient proteins and to characterise chemical changes.
20033124:26	We determined that the highly abundant seed storage proteins were affected by hydrolytic damage and that specific motifs are particularly prone to cleavage.
20033124:27	The finding also defines the basis for the development of a proteomic approach for species or sub-species attribution of archaeological seeds to integrate DNA-based methods.
20033124:28	Archaeological grape seeds have several traits that make them attractive for future studies on the domestication and diffusion processes of this important crop.
20033124:29	The data suggest that the material from York was not grown locally, whilst the remains from Supersano evoke relations with the eastern Mediterranean.
20033124:30	Successful genetic analysis of five microsatellite markers enabled a tentative comparison of the ancient profiles with the modern varieties, providing indications to corroborate archaeological hypotheses.
20033124:31	This is a significant achievement with promise of much more with the integration of high-throughput sequencing (Poinar et al. ; Green et al. ; Gilbert et al. ) for both ancient proteins and DNA.
18421371:0	Introduction 
Proteins carry out most of the work in the cell, and they frequently do so by interacting with other proteins.
18421371:1	Therefore, understanding protein and hence cellular function often entails knowing about various types of protein-protein interactions.
18421371:2	This paper describes a method for predicting these interactions using a supervised classification algorithm that learns from a variety of genome-wide data sets.
18421371:3	Three classes of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions are described in the scientific literature.
18421371:4	The first class consists of docking methods that employ detailed molecular simulations to dock two protein structures.
18421371:5	These methods do not scale to the entire genome, both because they require protein structures and because they are computationally expensive.
18421371:6	High-throughput computational methods fall into two classes: those that predict direct physical interactions – and those that predict both direct and indirect interactions (i.e., co-membership in a protein complex) – . The current work focuses on the latter problem: predicting co-complexed protein pairs (CCPPs).
18421371:7	We frame the problem as a supervised learning problem, and we train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate between pairs of proteins that are co-complexed and pairs that are not.
18421371:8	The SVM is a non-parametric statistical method for discriminating between two classes of data.
18421371:9	SVMs have been applied widely in bioinformatics, in applications as diverse as protein homology detection, alternative splicing prediction, microarray analysis and mass spectrometry analysis . Most relevantly, they have been used successfully to recognize physically interacting pairs of proteins , . The SVM operates by projecting the data into a vector space and finding a line (or, more generally, a hyperplane) that separates the classes in that space.
18421371:10	SVMs are motivated by statistical learning theory, which suggests an optimal method for identifying this separating hyperplane.
18421371:11	Furthermore, SVMs are part of a class of methods, known as kernel methods that make use of a specific notion of pairwise similarity ( kernel functions ) to project data into a high-dimensional vector space.
18421371:12	The benefits of the kernel approach are three-fold: the kernel function can incorporate prior knowledge of the problem domain; the kernel function can operate on non-vector data such as strings, sets or graphs, and kernel algebra allows us to combine heterogeneous types of data within a single classification framework.
18421371:13	The SVM algorithm and its application to biological data is described in an accessible fashion in ; a much more detailed description of SVM applications in computational biology is available in .
18421371:14	The ability to learn from heterogeneous data is of particular value in the prediction of CCPPs, because so many types of data are relevant to this task.
18421371:15	In this work, we define separate kernels that operate on each relevant data type.
18421371:16	These include three kernels on protein sequences, three kernels on different types of protein networks derived from high-throughput data, and kernels on gene expression, interologs, Gene Ontology terms, co-regulation and localization data.
18421371:17	We combine all of these kernels in a single classifier that achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy.
18421371:18	In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a particular type of kernel, the diffusion kernel for predicting CCPPs.
18421371:19	The diffusion kernel can be naturally applied to protein interaction networks.
18421371:20	Various types of networks, representing protein physical interactions, complexes and genetic interactions, can be identified by large-scale experiments: yeast two-hybrid assays for physical interaction detection , affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS) for complex detection , and large-scale mapping of genetic interactions .
18421371:21	The resulting protein interaction networks have been shown to exhibit several distinctive properties . First, the degrees of vertices exhibit a power-law distribution, with many vertices having a small number of connections, and few vertices having a large number of connections.
18421371:22	Second, the networks belong to the class of small world networks and contain densely connected local neighborhoods.
18421371:23	These network properties can be exploited to improve statistical inferences about protein-protein interactions.
18421371:24	Tong et al. showed that, although there is small overlap between genetically interacting protein pairs and CCPPs, proteins sharing a large number of neighbors in the genetic interaction network tend to be members of the same complex.
18421371:25	Goldberg and Roth used a mutual clustering coefficient (MCC) to describe the cohesiveness in the physical interaction network.
18421371:26	They showed that vertices with a high MCC are more likely to share an edge and that ranking by MCC improves the accuracy of edge inference.
18421371:27	MCC considers the number of common neighbors shared by two vertices, i.e., it only considers paths of length two.
18421371:28	In this study, we generalize upon MCC by using the diffusion kernel, which takes into account paths of all lengths . The diffusion kernel quantifies the distance between two nodes as the weighted sum of all paths connecting them, assigning larger weights to shorter paths.
18421371:29	Our experiments show that the diffusion kernel performs much better than MCC in ranking protein pairs.
18421371:30	In addition, we show that using a diffusion kernel in the context of an SVM classifier improves upon direct ranking by the diffusion kernel alone, and that a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel, which also only considers paths of length 2 in a network.
18421371:31	Next, we show that integration of different data sources improves the performance of our classifier.
18421371:32	The summation of sequence and diffusion kernels yields much better performance than either sequence or diffusion kernel alone.
18421371:33	This classifier successfully identifies 4789 out of 10980 positives before producing the first false positive.
18421371:34	The addition of features such as co-expression, co-regulation, interolog, co-localization and GO annotation improve the ROC 50 score from 0.859 to 0.937.
18421371:35	We also validate our method using two recently decribed large scale APMS data sets . When these data sets are not used for training, our predicted positives are significantly enriched with protein pairs that occur in both data sets.
18421371:36	After validating our method, we trained two SVM classifiers, one using all available data, and one that excludes GO annotations, and applied both classifiers to all pairs of yeast proteins.
18421371:37	The resulting predictions are available through the Yeast Resource Center . 
Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
In this paper, we developed multiple kernels from heterogeneous data sources and combined them in an SVM classifier to predict co-complexed protein pairs.
18421371:38	We applied the diffusion kernel to the two-hybrid, APMS and genetic interaction networks, and we found that, in all three cases, a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel or the mutual clustering coefficient (MCC).
18421371:39	A diffusion kernel computes the similarity between two vertices by summing over all paths connecting the two vertices with paths of shorter lengths receiving higher weight.
18421371:40	In contrast, a linear kernel or MCC only considers paths of length 2.
18421371:41	Our results indicate that taking into account the full network topology improves the prediction of CCPP edges.
18421371:42	We also applied our prediction scheme to the protein pairs identified by two recent large scale APMS data sets . Our predicted positives are enriched with protein pairs identified by both groups with high statistical significance, and are consistent with the highly accurate data set of Collins et al. Our method can thus be used to select a subset of these large scale results with better accuracy and reliability.
18421371:43	Different data sources provide complementary information, and each data source may have the best predictive power for a subset of data points.
18421371:44	For instance, some protein pairs may have no sequence homologs, and some other protein pairs may not be included in the yeast two-hybrid screen experiments.
18421371:45	Therefore, the combination of a variety of data sources has the potential to improve CCPP recognition.
18421371:46	Kernel methods present a natural way to combine features by the summation of kernel matrices.
18421371:47	Our results show that the TPPK applied to the summation of the sequence and diffusion kernels performs significantly better than either the sequence or the diffusion kernels alone.
18421371:48	Inclusion of RBF kernels on five additional data sets improves the ROC 50 performance further from 0.859 to 0.937.
18421371:49	We did not optimize the relative weights of the TPPK and RBF kernels.
18421371:50	One future direction is to learn these weights by using semidefinite programming sequential minimal optimization or semi-infinite programming . 
The method described here is specifically designed to work well in the presence of heterogeneous data—primary sequence, expression, interaction networks, etc.
18421371:51	As such, the method can be applied fairly directly to other well-studied eukaryotic genomes.
18421371:52	The minimal requirement for applying this method, or indeed any supervised learning algorithm, to a new organism is the availability of data (e.g., protein sequences) and labels (a set of known protein-protein interactions).
18421371:53	In practice, the latter is much more difficult to come by.
18421371:54	Typically, a genome with a sufficiently large set of high-quality interaction labels will likely also have available non-sequence data such as high-throughput interaction data and expression profiles.
18460176:0	Background 
The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process is based on three main operations: data preparation, data mining, and interpretation of the extracted units.
18460176:1	This process is guided and controlled by an expert of the concerned domain.
18460176:2	The KDD process has been successfully applied in various domains such as marketing, finance, and biomedicine . 
However applications of KDD are limited by the fact that strong interactions between the system and domain experts are necessary.
18460176:3	Data manipulated in life sciences are complex and data mining algorithms generate large volume of rough results.
18460176:4	As a consequence, the interpretation step of KDD in biology, aimed at extracting new and relevant knowledge units, is a hard task, i.e. time-consuming and tedious for the domain expert.
18460176:5	In computer science, ontologies provide a shared understanding of knowledge about a particular domain . Bio-ontologies are becoming more and more available and contribute to the understanding of the large amounts of data existing in life sciences . The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) has recently developed Bioportal that offers a unified panorama on available bio-ontologies .
18460176:6	One of the promising interests of bio-ontologies is their use for guiding the process of KDD as suggested by Anand , Cespivova , Gottgtroy , and Napoli . This idea seems to be much more realistic now that Semantic Web advances have given rise to common standards and technologies for expressing and sharing ontologies . 
In this way, the three main operations of KDD can take advantage of domain knowledge embedded in bio-ontologies.
18460176:7	(1) During the data preparation step, bio-ontologies can facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data and guide the selection of relevant data to be mined.
18460176:8	(2) During the mining step, domain knowledge allows the specification of constraints for guiding data mining algorithms by, e.g. narrowing the search space.
18460176:9	(3) During the interpretation step, domain knowledge helps experts to visualize and validate extracted units.
18460176:10	There exists a number of studies on the use of ontologies within the data mining step, e.g. , and the interpretation step e.g. [ - ].
18460176:11	Only a few studies (detailed hereafter) has focused on the first step, namely data preparation.
18460176:12	This is the purpose of the present paper.
18460176:13	Data preparation –or preprocessing– is aimed at improving the quality of the data, and consequently the efficiency of the KDD process.
18460176:14	Methods for data preparation involve operations of different types: data integration, data cleaning, data transformation and data reduction . These operations are not exclusive since they may be combined.
18460176:15	For example, data transformation can have an impact on data cleaning during normalisation of data.
18460176:16	Data integration can have an impact on data cleaning as well, when inconsistencies are detected and corrected, or when missing values are filled.
18460176:17	Still regarding data integration, the use of ontologies has been theoretically and practically studied in life sciences . In this way, we have defined and used an ontology for integrating data on genetic variants . Perez-Rey et al . have developed OntoDataClean, an ontology-based tool aimed at solving inconsistencies, missing and wrong values in datasets . Data transformation operation produce formatted data, i.e. normalised and smoothed data, ready for being processed by data mining algorithms.
18460176:18	Euler and Sholz propose a special ontology related to the transformation process .
18460176:19	This ontology provides facilities to manipulate data by using conceptualization of the transformation process.
18460176:20	The role of data reduction process is to reduce the description of data, e.g. lowering the number of dimensions within the data, without altering the integrity of the initial data set.
18460176:21	Strategies for data reduction include the followings.
18460176:22	– Data cube aggregation produces data cubes for storing multidimensional aggregated data (e.g. extracted from a data warehouse) for OLAP analysis . For example, data on daily sales hold on millions of items and can be aggregated into monthly sales of some selected categories of items.
18460176:23	– Dimension reduction leads to the encoding of data in a reduced format, with or without loss with respect to the initial data set.
18460176:24	For example, principal component analysis can be used for dimensionality reduction that applies projections of initial data onto a space of a smaller dimension.
18460176:25	– Data discretization techniques are used to reduce the number of values of an attribute and consequently facilitate interpretation of mining results.
18460176:26	Automatic discretization methods exist for continuous numerical attributes that recursively partition the attribute values according to a given scale.
18460176:27	For example, the range of an attribute price can be divided by the means of histogram analysis into several intervals, which can in turn be iteratively aggregated into larger intervals.
18460176:28	However, these methods do not apply for discrete or nominal attributes, when the attribute values of which are not ordered.
18460176:29	The scale for an attribute has then to be manually defined by domain experts and possibly refined with the help of heuristic methods . 
– Data selection aims at identifying appropriate subsets among the initial set of attributes.
18460176:30	This operation can be performed with the help of heuristic methods based on tests of significance or entropy-based attribute evaluation measures such as the information gain . Data selection is one of the data reduction methods that is studied in this paper.
18460176:31	The use of domain knowledge in KDD process can be considered from two points of view.
18460176:32	The first one uses knowledge about the KDD process itself, i.e. domain represented within ontologies are data transformation, data cleaning, or the whole KDD domain .
18460176:33	The second one uses knowledge related to the dataset domain , e.g. pharmacogenomics.
18460176:34	The work presented in this article follows the second view, and focuses on data preparation, and more precisely, on data selection.
18460176:35	In addition it is made precise how available domain knowledge –contained in a knowledge base (KB)– can assist the domain expert in selecting relevant attributes or object subsets.
18460176:36	Our case-study deals with genotype-phenotype relationships.
18460176:37	Finding relationships between genotype and phenotype is of primary interest in biological research.
18460176:38	Large scale clinical studies provide large mass of genomic and post-genomic data produced by high-throughput biotechnology devices (e.g. microarray, mass spectrometry).
18460176:39	Recent studies [ - ] have shown that data mining methods can be used for extracting unexpected and hidden correlations between genotype and phenotype.
18460176:40	However, these studies also illustrate the difficulty of achieving these analyses, mainly because of domain complexity and large volume of data to be analysed.
18460176:41	Keeping this in mind, we will illustrate here the benefits of using ontology for data selection within a KDD process, whose objective is to extract relationships between genomic variants and phenotype traits.
18460176:42	The data sources explored in the experience described in this paper have two origins: (i) there are private datasets resulting from clinical investigations relative to Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), (ii) there are public databases (i.e. dbSNP, HapMap, OMIM, and Locus Specific Databases) partially integrated within SNP-KB, a knowledge-base developed in our laboratory.
18460176:43	An example of expected relationships that can be of interest, is in concern with modulator variants, i.e. any genomic variant (or group of variants) related to disease or disease symptom modulation.
18460176:44	Various levels of severity are for example observed in FH depending on allele versions of two genomic variants in the APOE gene (rs7412 and rs429358) . Modulator variants are of particular interest in pharmacogenomics since they are known to modulate the metabolism and effect of drugs . 
The next section on results presents an overview of the ontology-guided data selection method.
18460176:45	Three scenarios of data selection are described and illustrate the proposition and its advantages.
18460176:46	Results 
Discussion 
Data selection is a crucial step in KDD process and any attention paid to selection makes more efficient the KDD process.
18460176:47	Indeed, the computational cost in space and time of data mining algorithms is exponential (at worst), and any reduction of the initial dataset has effect on the whole data mining process.
18460176:48	In addition, the practical use of data mining algorithms is also often limited by size of datasets or machine capabilities.
18460176:49	For example, the extraction of frequent itemsets from the FH dataset on a standard workstation with a Pentium 1.8Ghz and 2Mb of RAM has to be limited to the calculation of the “most frequent” itemsets since the minimum support has to be set very high (i.e. 96%).
18460176:50	Data selection is an important operation participating to the preparation step of the KDD, allowing the data mining algorithm to handle large dataset.
18460176:51	Comparative tests show that data selection reduces quite always the volume of results and, in some cases, the redundancy within the extracted units.
18460176:52	The efficiency of data selection is not so surprising and demonstrates, to a certain extent, some advantages of using ontology.
18460176:53	More importantly, an actual positive feedback from the domain expert has been observed, who has enthusiastically piloted the data selection, being assisted by an ontology.
18460176:54	The smaller size of the results has been a second cause of satisfaction for the domain expert, since results of the data mining tests have revealed non-standard results that may be of interest with respect to the domain knowledge.
18460176:55	Ontology-guided data selection can be performed by taking advantage of subsumption relationships between ontology classes and by defining subsets of instances corresponding to the most specific classes.
18460176:56	When association rules have been extracted from a reduced dataset, the subsumption relationships can be followed within the ontology, for generalizing the association rules.
18460176:57	This bottom-up traversal of the ontology can be used, for example, to check whether an extracted association rule between a coding variant and a phenotypic trait can be extended to some non-coding variants.
18460176:58	This kind of association may be observed when intron splice sites are affected as discussed in . 
Conclusions 
This paper illustrates how domain knowledge captured in bio-ontologies facilitates the KDD process.
18460176:59	An approach for data selection has been proposed that takes good advantage of time and effort spent for the KB construction.
18460176:60	Three proposed scenarios of data selection can be combined in order to define optimized KDD strategies fulfilling biomedical objectives.
18460176:61	For that purpose, additional scenarios can be planned such as object unification, i.e. grouping together patients from the same family and retaining a unique representative for the family, thus reducing the number of objects to be manipulated.
18460176:62	The selection process depends on instance properties (object and data properties), and accordingly on data and instantiation quality.
18460176:63	When an instance is missing or presents a fault, the selection will be erroneous or impossible.
18460176:64	In this way, the available knowledge on haplotypes could also be used for completing missing values about observed alleles of each member of a haplotype.
18460176:65	Challenging future work consists in automatically formalizing the results of the KDD process within a knowledge representation language, for enriching both the ontology and the KB.
18460176:66	Such a capability allows to iteratively run the KDD process, using more complete domain knowledge after each KDD iteration.

21475608:0	Case Report 
A 65-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital for a planned cataract extraction in her right eye (OD).
21475608:1	Preoperative examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/50 s.c. OD and the presence of a nuclear sclerotic cataract grade 3.
21475608:2	The patient's personal and family medical history was unremarkable.
21475608:3	The operation was uneventful and the adjusted phacoemulsification time was 0.294 min.
21475608:4	One milligram/0.1 ml intracameral cefuroxime was injected at the end of the operation, and the patient was put on topical gentamicin and 0.1% dexamethasone drops q.i.d.
21475608:5	Postoperative visual acuity was 20/25 s.c. OD.
21475608:6	Two weeks later, and while the patient was still taking the prescribed drops, she was examined in our emergency department complaining of a sudden vision reduction in her operated eye.
21475608:7	In fact, her visual acuity was reduced to 20/60 s.c. OD.
21475608:8	On clinical examination, the patient did not report any pain, and adnexa were normal.
21475608:9	Slit-lamp examination revealed a corneal edema with Descemet's folds.
21475608:10	The anterior chamber was deep, with mild Tyndall effect, +2 cells and no signs of hypopyon.
21475608:11	Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg.
21475608:12	After dilation of the pupil, an apparent biofilm was covering the anterior surface of the intraocular lens which did not obscure fundoscopy, and in the capsular bag an evident fibrinous exudate could be found.
21475608:13	The vitreous was normal, with no cells and signs of vitritis.
21475608:14	These findings resulted in a good retinal view without any signs of abnormality.
21475608:15	The patient was therefore admitted for an emergency 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy.
21475608:16	The activity in the vitreous was not markedly elevated, and after a vitreous sample had been taken and the vitreous removed, a posterior capsulotomy was made using a vitreous cutter.
21475608:17	Meticulous rinse of the capsular bag was performed, and the trocars were removed after the administration of 1 mg/0.1 ml vancomycin and amikacin to the vitreous cavity.
21475608:18	After the operation, the patient was advised to use internally fabricated topical fixed-combination fortified vancomycin-amikacin q.i.d. as previously described , combined with topical drops of 0.1% dexamethasone suspension q.i.d.
21475608:19	After a 1-week microbiological investigation, cultures revealed positivity for Actinomyces only, and in particular for Actinomyces meyeri . To match the microbiological results, the treatment was modified with the use of topical drops of ofloxacin and steroids q.i.d.
21475608:20	The patient tolerated this treatment well and her visual acuity began to recuperate.

21475608:23	Discussion 
Actinomycosis is an infection caused by the filamentous, Gram-positive, non-acid-fast, non-spore-forming bacteria Actinomyces spp.
21475608:24	They belong to the order of Actinomycetales, family Actinomycetaceae, and genus Actinomyces . 
The first report available reporting ocular infection due to a species of Actinomyces comes from Roussel et al. . They reported a case series of postoperative endophthalmitis for which different species of Actinomyces were incriminated, but not A.
21475608:25	meyeri . Nonetheless, this study demonstrates various differences from our case report.
21475608:26	First of all, the report was made during the extracapsular cataract extraction era, whereas in our report the patient developed endophthalmitis after a small-incision clear corneal cataract extraction.
21475608:27	This is a factor of major safety against the ab externo entrance of microorganisms into the ocular microenvironment.
21475608:28	Moreover, the pharmacological approach was different between these two studies; in our report, technological and pharmacological research has permitted a better control of the intraocular infection and thus better final results.
21475608:29	In addition to this, the surgical intervention was less traumatic, and the intraocular lens was not removed, which did not impair the patient's recovery.
21475608:30	Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time A. meyeri is isolated from a site of infectious endophthalmitis as the only suspect for its occurrence.
21475608:31	Our hypothesis is that the microorganism's low virulence, combined with the prompt, decisive and evidence-based response, resulted in the excellent clinical outcome (fig.
21475608:32	fig.
21475608:33	fig.
21475608:34	).
21475608:35	In cases of chronic postoperative infectious endophthalmitis, the recommendation of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) guidelines  consists of topical and systemic antibiotic treatment.
21475608:36	If no resolution occurs, recommendations revert to pars plana vitrectomy with capsulectomy and intraocular lens removal.
21475608:37	In our case, the inflammatory response seemed quite clearly restricted to the anterior segment, with only mild vitreous opacification, corresponding to grade 1 cellular infiltration in the vitreous.
21475608:38	Therefore, we opted to not remove the intraocular lens, and after the capsulectomy we irrigated the capsular bag with balanced salt solution containing no antibiotics.
21475608:39	In conclusion, we report a case of chronic infectious endophthalmitis where, for the first time, A.
21475608:40	meyeri has been clearly found to be the causative agent.
21475608:41	The therapeutic regimen included a pars plana vitrectomy without the removal of the intraocular lens, a capsulectomy, the irrigation of the capsular bag with balanced salt solution only and the injection of intraocular antibiotics.
21475608:42	Finally, we prescribed topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drops without the need to hospitalize the patient and without the prescription of systemic antibiotics.
21475608:43	The clinical result was very positive for the patient.

17012782:0	Introduction 
Laccases (benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductases; EC 1.19.3.2) are widely distributed in higher plants and fungi.
17012782:1	They belong to the family of multi-copper oxidases, which also includes ascorbate oxidase and ceruloplasmin.
17012782:2	Laccases catalyze the oxidation of a broad range of different substrates, such as phenols, methoxysubstituted phenols, diamines and some inorganic compounds (Adman, 1991 ; Reinhammar, 1984 ; Thurston, 1994 ; Xu et al. 1996 ; Sakurai, 1992 ).
17012782:3	These enzymes contain as least one mononuclear ‘blue’ copper site (T1 centre) and a trinuclear site comprising one type 2 copper and two type 3 coppers (T2/T3 centre).
17012782:4	The three different copper types have been classified according to their optical and EPR spectra (Malmstrom, 1982 ).
17012782:5	The catalytic mechanism for multi-copper oxidases generally involves the transfer of four electrons from the substrates attached to the T1 copper centre to the oxygen molecule bound to the T2/T3 centre, thus reducing dioxygen to two water molecules (Messerschmidt et al. 1992 ; Lindley, 2001 ; Bento et al. 2005 ).
17012782:6	The molecular properties of laccase and the nature of its copper-containing active sites have been studied extensively by biochemical and spectroscopic methods over the last 50 y (see, for example, reviews by Reinhammar, 1997 ; Mayer & Staples, 2002 ).
17012782:7	In most cases laccases are monomeric glycoproteins of around 500 amino acids with molecular weights in the range 60–85 kDa, depending on the carbohydrate content.
17012782:8	For a long time, attempts to crystallize laccase for X-­ray analysis were unsuccessful despite considerable efforts in several laboratories.
17012782:9	The major problem was attributed to the presence of carbohydrate chains and their heterogeneity.
17012782:10	However, during the last decade the crystal structures of several fungal laccases (Ducros et al. 1998 2001 ; Piontek et al. 2002 ; Bertrand et al. 2002 ; Hakulinen et al. 2002 ) and a bacterial laccase (Enguita et al. 2004 ) have been determined.
17012782:11	A revised mechanism for the reduction of dioxygen, based on the X-ray structures of complexes of bacterial laccase, has been proposed recently (Bento et al. 2005 ).
17012782:12	Materials and methods 
Results and discussion 
The electron-density maps are of good quality and have allowed tracing of the polypeptide chain throughout the molecule (Fig. 2 ).
17012782:13	In the initial stages of refinement, four copper sites were revealed in the ( F 
   o − F 
   c) electron-density maps.
17012782:14	These provided further confirmation of the correct solution of the structure, since the Cu atoms were not included in the starting coordinates.
17012782:15	The occupancies of the Cu ions in C. maxima laccase were refined with the program SHELX 97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997 ).
17012782:16	Some depletion of the type 1 and type 2 copper ions was observed: the occupancies of Cu1, Cu2, Cu3 and Cu4 were 0.8, 1.0, 1.0 and 0.83, respectively.
17012782:17	It was possible to unambiguously identify 65 side chains of the unknown sequence of the C. maxima laccase using ( F 
   o − F 
   c) difference maps at 1.9 Å resolution.
17012782:18	The overall molecular structure of the C. maxima laccase (Fig. 2 ) shows a high homology with other laccase structures reported previously (Lindley, 2001 ).
17012782:19	The enzyme is a monomer consisting of three cupredoxin-like domains (Fig. 2 ): I (residues 1–131), II (residues 132–309) and III (residues 310–499).
17012782:20	Domain I comprises 11 β-­strands and one helix.
17012782:21	The second domain comprises 11 β-strands and the third domain contains six β-strands and three helixes.
17012782:22	The long α-­helix at the C-terminus of the laccase is stabilized by a disulfide bridge between Cys85 and Cys488 (2.05 Å).
17012782:23	A second disulfide bridge, Cys117–Cys205 (2.02 Å), links domains I and II.
17012782:24	Both the N- and C-terminal amino acids are hydrogen bonded to the main part of the protein and are well defined in the electron density.
17012782:25	The mononuclear copper site is located in domain III, close to the potential substrate-binding cavity.
17012782:26	In a similar manner to other multi-copper oxidases, the cation has planar trigonal coordination via cysteine residue Cys453 and the two histidines His395 and His458.
17012782:27	Phe463 and Ile455 lie on either side of the plane, with closest distances of 3.66 and 3.55 Å, respectively.
17012782:28	Ile455 is near to the putative substrate cavity.
17012782:29	Other fungal laccases have aliphatic residues in this axial position.
17012782:30	In the C. cinereus laccase (Ducros et al. 2001 ), the axial position is occupied by Leu462 at a distance of 3.51 Å from the copper ion.
17012782:31	In the T. versicolor laccase (Piontek et al. 2002 ), there is a phenylalanine in this position at a distance of 3.6 Å.
17012782:32	This configuration differs from that found for ascorbate oxidase (Messerchmidt et al. 1992 ), the cotA laccase from Bacillus subtilis (Enguita et al. 2003 ) and CueO from Escherichia coli (Roberts et al. 2002 ), where a methionine S atom is in an axial position at a distance of about 3.0 Å from the copper ion.
17012782:33	The trinuclear copper cluster is localized between domains I and III and is bound to the protein by eight histidines, four each from domains I and III; access to the ions is provided by two solvent channels.
17012782:34	Regions of high electron density were also identified at the periphery of the molecule in the vicinity of Asn54, Asn217 and Asn436 and have been interpreted as N-linked glycosylation sites.
17012782:35	Two of the glycans of the C. maxima laccase structure form a covalently bonded framework, which appears to strengthen the crystal packing and obviously supports the growth of well ordered crystals suitable for X-ray analysis.
17012782:36	Further studies are currently under way to investigate the precise conditions under which these covalent bonds between glycan chains are formed for the C. maxima laccase.
21235756:0	Background 
The recent natural dispersal area of the European grayling ( Thymallus thymallus ) extends westward to France and Great Britain, northward across Fenoscandinavia and northern Russia, eastward to the Ural Mountains near the Kara River  and southward to the headwaters in the drainage areas of Ibar (Serbia) and Lim (the Ljuča River, Montenegro) Rivers in the western Balkans.
21235756:1	Fossil evidence suggests that European grayling inhabited Europe long before the Pleistocene cold periods , corroborating the pre-glacial introgression of grayling and its expansion across Europe, as also suggested by Weiss et al. . Numerous DNA marker-based studies on population genetic structure, phylogeography and phylogeny of European grayling are now available for various geographic regions (e.g. [ - ]), as well as on local scales (e.g. [ - ]).
21235756:2	Studies on the matrilineal phylogeography and post-glacial dispersal routes of European grayling have revealed 27 haplotypes in the ND-5/6 and cyt-b/D-loop (CR) regions of mitochondrial DNA , 58 haplotypes in the D-loop (CR) region  and 30 ND-1 haplotypes in the ND-5/6 gene region . All the results suggest the existence of distinct Danubian clades, as well as Central-Eastern, Central-Western, Northern/Northeastern and mixed clades . Rather distinct grayling clades were detected in the Adriatic region and in the Loire basin with a single haplotype (At1) that is highly divergent compared to those of the remaining clades . The assumed refugial region for (i) the Northern/Northeastern-European clade was the area north of the Caspian and Black Seas, (ii) the Central-Eastern European clade, the ice-free tributaries of Vistula and Elbe Rivers, (iii) the Central-Western Europe, the ice-free tributaries of Rhine, Main and upper Danube, and (iv) the Danubian clades, the lower Danube drainage area, i.e., in the Balkan Peninsula .
21235756:3	Based on CR mtDNA sequence analyses and calibration of molecular clock applied to the nucleotide divergence of these sequences between the major grayling clades with a CR mutation rate of 1% per million years (MY), Froufe et al.  have dated the colonization of Europe to the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary around 4.6 to 1.6 million years ago (MYA), far before the onset of Pleistocene ice age.
21235756:4	However, during the late Pleistocene and Holocene glaciations, it is assumed that secondary contacts occurred in all drainages, e.g. in the upper reaches of the rivers Main, Danube, Elbe and Rhine (Lake Constance) . Koskinen et al.  have revealed that a substantial proportion of molecular variation (44%) in European grayling exits between populations, whereas Gum et al.  have revealed that about 25% of the total genetic variation is explained by differences between major drainage systems, about 11 to 20% by differences between populations within drainages and about 57 to 64% by differences within populations.
21235756:5	The Balkan Peninsula along with the Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas, were a refuge area during the Pleistocene glaciations and therefore might represent crossroads of different evolutionary patterns and processes . The Balkan Peninsula, in contrast to the Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas, is poorly explored (except Slovenia).
21235756:6	This part of Europe, very important for post-glacial faunal evolution and colonization, is noted as a biodiversity hotspot . The last (Würm) glaciation in Europe ended ~10 000 years ago coinciding with both colonization of the present grayling habitat and decline of grayling populations.
21235756:7	Based on the 34 European populations (none from the Balkans), between 1000 to 10000 years ago, population sizes were reduced to 0.03-1.2% of their historical sizes .
21235756:8	An even more recent decline of European grayling populations throughout central Europe, due to pollution, habitat destruction, river engineering, predation from piscivorous birds and overfishing [ , - ], is also characteristic to Serbian grayling populations.
21235756:9	Janković  has reported results for six Serbian rivers with grayling populations (Drina, Lim, Uvac, Jadar, Studenica and Ibar).
21235756:10	The populations from Uvac, Jadar and Studenica Rivers went extinct, while one new population was established in the Rzav River through stocking with fish originating from an unknown source population from Slovenia.
21235756:11	Population decline leads to an increase in management activities that involve rearing and stocking grayling, which may cause a change in genetic architecture and extinction of natural populations . 
The main goal of the present study was to investigate the genetic diversity of grayling populations in Serbia, using two mtDNA loci (CR and ATP6), in order to clarify the phylogeography of grayling populations in this previously unstudied part of its native range.
21235756:12	Additionally, 12 microsatellite loci were analyzed, in order to (i) characterize the genetic variability and differentiation, (ii) compare recent and historical declines in previously studied European populations  with that of Serbian populations and (iii) examine whether it is possible to identify non-introgressed indigenous populations of grayling for future management and supportive breeding.
21235756:13	Methods 
Results 
Discussion 
Conclusions 
Serbian grayling populations are genetically distinct from Slovenian and other European populations.
21235756:14	In order to preserve their overall genetic diversity and integrity, further stocking of non-native fish from other regions or from allochthonous populations in the Rzav River should be stopped.
21235756:15	Populations from the Ibar and Lim Rivers (which show no signs of introgression of non-native grayling), as well as the population from the Drina River should be regarded as native and subject to proper management.
21235756:16	The population from the Drina River is the most diverse in this study and the only one with the mtDNA haplotype Da29.
21235756:17	It probably represents the most valuable genetic resource in the region.
21235756:18	However, any future management such as supplementary stocking of hatchery-reared Drina River grayling should take into consideration genetic testing prior formation of brood stock, because introgression has been detected.
21235756:19	Since the area studied here represents only a minor part of the Balkan Peninsula, genetic polymorphism of the grayling within the region as a whole may be even higher, because grayling from the countries adjacent to Serbia (i.e., Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina) have not been studied so far.

19926134:0	Background 
Anorexia nervosa is a mental disorder which often leads to serious risk of physical harm or even death to the individual, through self-imposed dietary or other behavioural strategies aimed at losing weight and self harm.
19926134:1	However, there is controversy over whether compulsory treatment for anorexia nervosa is appropriate.
19926134:2	Compulsion is not solely achieved through legal measures.
19926134:3	Some mental health professionals use not only formal legal powers to compel patients to have treatment, but also the threat of legal orders or other powers as ‘leverage’ to obtain agreement to treatment.
19926134:4	In cases where patients are legal minors, it is common to use other means of compulsion such as parental consent.
19926134:5	Psychiatric patients' perceptions of coercion are complex and not directly correlated with the use of compulsory legal orders.
19926134:6	One study found that patients with anorexia nervosa experience high levels of ‘perceived coercion’—that is, the perception that they are being coerced whether or not formal mechanisms are used.
19926134:7	Some of these patients changed their views in hindsight about the coercion that they had received.
19926134:8	Most research in this area has focussed on using quantitative measures of perception of coercion.
19926134:9	There have been few in-depth studies exploring the views of patients who suffer or have suffered from anorexia nervosa, about their experiences of coercion and compulsory treatment.
19926134:10	Method 
A qualitative interview study was carried out to determine the views of people with anorexia nervosa as well as their parents with respect to compulsory treatment, treatment decision-making and competence.
19926134:11	In this article we report the patient participants' views concerning compulsory treatment.
19926134:12	The qualitative interviews were semi-structured and the interview was conducted using a topic guide, which served as a springboard for wider, more flexible and unstructured narratives and discussions.
19926134:13	Participants were asked to talk about their own experiences of treatment, and the interviewer encouraged elaboration of experiences relating to the three main foci of the study given above.
19926134:14	Questions in the topic guide relating specifically to compulsory treatment are listed in . As will be seen the questions ask about whether it is acceptable to ‘make people have treatment’ or ‘to be treated even if they don't agree’.
19926134:15	The concept of coercion and compulsory treatment was thus left to participants to interpret as they saw fit and was not defined in terms of legal processes.
19926134:16	The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed, with names and places removed.
19926134:17	The coding framework categorising the broad issues discussed in the interviews was developed through repeated readings of the transcripts, followed by trials of application to transcripts and discussions between two coders who coded some transcripts independently.
19926134:18	Each transcript was then coded using the final coding framework.
19926134:19	Common emergent themes as well as divergent themes within each category of the frame were further analysed.
19926134:20	The N6 qualitative software programme was used to assist the coding process and collation of themes and subthemes.
19926134:21	Participants 
Twenty-nine patients with current or recent anorexia nervosa were recruited from four different treatment centres in southern England, which covered a range of characteristics: private and National Health Service, adolescent and adult treatment services, specialist eating disorder centres and general mental health units.
19926134:22	The patients' ages ranged from 15 years 10 months to 26 years 2 months (median 17 years 0 months, mean 18 years 1 month).
19926134:23	Note that in England the age of legal majority is 18 years, which is also usually the age at which patients move from adolescent to adult mental health services.
19926134:24	Although one of the treatment centres did allow goals of ‘maintenance’ for certain adult patients not yet ready to accept treatment, for all the participants in this study the treatment from the mental health services consisted of a combination of a weight restoration as well as psychological therapies.
19926134:25	Agreement to treatment therefore meant accepting both weight restoration and psychological treatment.
19926134:26	Patient records were not accessed, so all information was obtained from the participants themselves.
19926134:27	Participants' self-reported Body Mass Indices (BMI) ranged from 12.4 (dangerously underweight) to 28.4 (overweight, technically ‘pre-obese’), with a mean body mass index of 17.7 (below normal range) and a median BMI of 17.65.
19926134:28	By their own accounts, the participants were at various stages of illness, treatment and recovery at the time of interview.
19926134:29	Of the 29 participants, eight were inpatients in mental health units although at the time of interview none was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983.
19926134:30	Eighteen participants were either day patients or outpatients utilising mental health services at the time of interview.
19926134:31	One participant was waiting to have treatment.
19926134:32	One participant had been discharged by the eating disorder service after declining an offer of inpatient treatment for low weight.
19926134:33	One participant had chosen not to accept treatment as she had a previous aversive experience of inpatient treatment.
19926134:34	Of the eight inpatient participants, five described themselves as having been admitted without free choice, either owing to parental pressure or under the implied or overt threat from the mental health professionals of a Mental Health Act 1983 ‘section’ (compulsory detention order for the purposes of assessment or treatment) if they did not comply.
19926134:35	Two of these had subsequently been placed on a Mental Health Act 1983 Section 3 (a compulsory detention order for treatment of a mental disorder) during the course of their admission and both had been recently discharged from the Section 3 order at the time of interview.
19926134:36	One of these two patients had also experienced being detained using the Mental Health Act 1983 during a previous admission.
19926134:37	Only three of the eight inpatients, therefore, described themselves as having made a free choice to be admitted to hospital for the current admission, and one of these three participants described a previous inpatient admission to a different unit to which she had not given consent.
19926134:38	Only three of the 18 day patient and outpatient participants said they had made a choice to enter and remain in treatment on their own.
19926134:39	Six participants described being coerced into having treatment against their will.
19926134:40	A further nine described either shared decisions concerning treatment made together with doctors and parents (with varying degrees of pressure from professionals and parents ranging from encouragement to ultimatums), or decisions about treatment made by doctors and relatives on their behalves with their tacit agreement.
19926134:41	It is important to note that the Mental Health Act 1983 did not enable compulsory outpatient or day patient treatment, so no formal compulsory treatment under mental health legislation would have been possible.
19926134:42	Only two out of the 29 participants (6.9%) had ever experienced formal compulsory treatment, both under the Mental Health Act 1983; but 15 of the 29 participants (51.7%) gave accounts of having experienced loss of freedom of choice regarding treatment either during their current treatment or in the past.
19926134:43	Types of loss of freedom of choice included ‘leverage’ in the form of threats (overt or implied) of compulsory admission, other types of compulsion such as parental consent for treatment, or restriction of choices such as only being allowed to choose between types of treatment (for example, inpatient or outpatient) but not whether to have treatment.
19926134:44	These figures are consistent with the published literature.
19926134:45	This literature shows that a relatively low proportion of inpatients with anorexia nervosa are placed on formal compulsory treatment orders, with reports ranging from 9% to 28%.
19926134:46	A user survey, however, suggests that a much higher proportion of patients perceive a lack of choice regarding treatment, and some studies suggest that ‘leverage’ is commonly used by psychiatrists with a significant minority of psychiatric patients in order to increase compliance with treatment without resorting to legal compulsion.
19926134:47	Results 
Discussion 
Whatever their views about the use of compulsion in anorexia nervosa in general, or on issues of competence and capacity, all participants thought that it is right to impose treatment in order to save life.
19926134:48	No participant supported the view that it is right to allow a person with anorexia nervosa to die as a result of respecting their refusal of treatment.
19926134:49	A concept that is receiving increasing research attention is that of ‘perceived coercion’.
19926134:50	This is the idea that psychiatric patients often experience coercion whether or not formal legal means are used.
19926134:51	Such coercion includes ‘leverage’ when a patient may be ‘encouraged’ to behave in a certain way through a threat of the use of more formal coercion or the loss of some benefit.
19926134:52	The participants in this study described such perceived coercion.
19926134:53	Indeed their experience of formal legal compulsion was much less frequent than that of other forms of compulsion.
19926134:54	The participants' frequent accounts of experiences of lack of choice and the use of leverage are ethically problematic when contrasted with the relative infrequency of legal compulsion they experienced.
19926134:55	On the one hand, the use of leverage can be an effective and flexible way of enabling acceptance of treatment while avoiding the stigmatizing and potentially traumatic experience of formal legal compulsion, and may not be experienced negatively; on the other hand, the use of leverage and other non-legal forms of coercion leave already vulnerable patients at risk of unethical treatment and loss of autonomy and rights without the protection of legal procedure, advocacy and right of appeal that formal legal compulsion brings.
19926134:56	It has been argued that it is unethical and discriminatory towards those with mental disorders to use any form of coercion or act in a patient's best interests without consent unless he or she clearly lacks capacity; and furthermore, that coercion is counterproductive in anorexia nervosa.
19926134:57	Studies suggest that patient perception of ‘coercion’ or experience of formal legal compulsion is not subsequently associated with a poorer engagement with treatment or poorer therapeutic relationship with mental health professionals.
19926134:58	The limited research also does not clearly show that formal compulsory treatment is associated with poorer short or longer term clinical outcome.
19926134:59	Even if there is no clinical harm, however, the issue of compulsion in treatment for anorexia nervosa is still ethically problematic.
19926134:60	From the ethical point of view, a traditional stance is that patient autonomy should be respected even if unwise or foolish decisions are made, and the justification for acting in a patient's best interests instead of according to his or her wishes is the pivotal issue of capacity.
19926134:61	What is striking from this study is that the issue of capacity was not the central one for participants in the context of compulsory treatment.
19926134:62	It is true that many participants did view treatment refusal by people with anorexia nervosa as problematic because the anorexia compromises decision-making.
19926134:63	But this was not the main issue in their consideration of the rights and wrongs of compulsion.
19926134:64	The main issues centred on their relationships with those involved in the treatment: health professionals and sometimes parents.
19926134:65	The participants did not appear to resent leverage or ‘informal’ compulsion if it is carried out in the context of a trusting relationship and perceived as care and help, and may not even experience it as coercive.
19926134:66	These results have implications for the ethical analysis of compulsory treatment in the context of anorexia.
19926134:67	One approach, we suggest, is that, on the accounts of those with anorexia, the central issue is not the question of whether and when a person lacks capacity to consent to, or refuse, treatment.
19926134:68	Instead the central issue concerns the context and relationships involved in good and compassionate psychiatric care.
19926134:69	A greater objective restriction of choice may be experienced as less negative, and indeed ultimately as good care, if conducted within a trusting and supportive relationship and environment.
19926134:70	Such an approach might be seen as a ‘virtue ethics approach’ in which the focus is on how carers can act with compassion.
19926134:71	It is also consistent with recent trends in bioethics that highlight the importance of trust in decision-making.
19926134:72	An alternative response to the accounts reported here is to retain the emphasis on autonomy and capacity in thinking about the ethics of compulsion but to suggest that more subtle and broader difficulties in making treatment decisions may need to be considered.
19926134:73	Key questions are: when and why a patient may fail to make autonomous decisions because of the influence of the mental disorder, and whether help and even coercion to engage in treatment might increase autonomy.
19926134:74	Conversely, a patient may technically lack capacity, for example being impaired in his or her ability to retain information, but broader factors such as an ability to express underlying values may enable him or her to continue to make valid choices with the appropriate support.
19926134:75	These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, as poor relationships and difficult or hostile settings tend to disempower patients with respect to whether they feel able to make decisions for themselves and can also cause them to resist or refuse help; while strong, trusting relationships and supportive treatment settings tend to facilitate patients in making their own decisions and help them to feel more actively involved in their care.
19926134:76	Indeed, the ethical justifications voiced in these results suggest that it is a complex mix of a virtue ethics and nuanced capacity approach that is used by patients in thinking of their experiences of, and attitudes to, compulsory treatment and coercion.
19926134:77	The analysis of this study and results of a previous study suggest that in anorexia nervosa issues of control and choice can have a strong influence on whether patients are able to make decisions.
19926134:78	This is because patients suffering from anorexia nervosa often struggle to remain in control of themselves and their lives and, as a result, resist help, while at the same time feeling out of control with respect to their eating behaviour and wishing to have help.
19926134:79	In conclusion, in this qualitative interview study, patients with anorexia nervosa reported considerable experience of compulsion and restriction of choice despite a relative lack of the use of formal compulsory treatment.
19926134:80	Nevertheless, there is strong consensus that compulsory treatment should be used if needed to save life in anorexia nervosa.
19926134:81	There was less consensus concerning the use of compulsory measures for the treatment of anorexia nervosa in the absence of immediate risk to life.
19926134:82	A striking result was that what mattered most to participants was not whether they were compelled to have treatment but the nature of their relationships with parents and mental health professionals.
19926134:83	Indeed, within a trusting relationship compulsion may be experienced as care.
20563279:0	A brief inventory of the Dreyfus model 
Types of knowledge and the Dreyfus model 
Because one of the most important referents of the model is knowledge, it would be of some benefit to review that concept.
20563279:1	There are many kinds of knowledge and several ways of grouping these kinds into large categories.
20563279:2	A division of knowledge that is relevant when analyzing Dreyfus model is into know-that and know-how.
20563279:3	Traditionally, explicit knowledge or ‘knowing that’ has been understood as expressible in some languages; it can be attained easily from any codified information.
20563279:4	By contrast, ‘knowing how,’ tacit or implicit knowledge, as it was proposed by philosopher Michael Polanyi, is not expressible in some languages.
20563279:5	It is considered intuitive – acquired through practical experience – and as such, is subjective and contextual, and cannot be readily made explicit or formalized.
20563279:6	Polanyi also suggested the supremacy of such implicit knowledge: ‘While tacit knowledge can be possessed by itself, explicit knowledge must rely on being tacitly understood and applied.
20563279:7	Hence all knowledge is either tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge’.
20563279:8	In psychology, the knowledge gained in implicit learning is defined by using several criteria.
20563279:9	It is not fully accessible to consciousness.
20563279:10	The learner cannot provide a full verbal account of what he has learned.
20563279:11	Implicit knowledge does not involve processes of conscious hypothesis testing.
20563279:12	In addition, implicit knowledge is preserved in cases of amnesia; thus, implicit learning relies on neuronal mechanisms other than the hippocampal memory system.
20563279:13	Implicit knowledge is stored as abstract – and possibly instantiated – representations rather than aggregate or verbatim representations.
20563279:14	This knowledge may also be inflexible because of its non-hippocampal base.
20563279:15	Knowledge that represents its content, attitude, and its holder explicitly is on the higher-order thought theory, conscious, and is considered explicit.
20563279:16	Explicit mental representation is required to refer in verbal communication and thus a link emerges between explicitness and consciousness.
20563279:17	The explicit processing of knowledge includes perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes, such as stimulus selection and search, attention focusing and maintenance, memorization, computation, decision making, response selection, and execution.
20563279:18	Recently, neuroscientists have proposed the Competition between Verbal and Implicit Systems (COVIS) model to explain the brain functional specialization and localization for the processing of these two types of knowledge.
20563279:19	The verbal (explicit) system is mediated by frontal brain areas, such as the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and the head of the caudate nucleus.
20563279:20	The implicit system is mainly mediated by the tail of the caudate nucleus and a dopamine-mediated reward signal.
20563279:21	The role of the basal ganglia in implicit learning and knowledge has been investigated through the study of people with Huntington's or Parkinson's disease.
20563279:22	Besides the COVIS model, there is evidence that the frontal lobes appear to be involved in the evaluation of implicit knowledge in making conceptual fluency judgments.
20563279:23	Hippocampus-dependent memory systems subserve explicit memory formation.
20563279:24	There is considerable evidence in favor of this ‘specialization’ and division of knowledge ( , ).
20563279:25	However, there is not any evidence that sophisticated skills are performed either without a rich connection of both neuronal subsystems or without a rich interplay of both domains of knowledge.
20563279:26	Galanter and Smith observed that even in subjects who are not engaging in conscious hypothesis testing, they can still notice that there is a pattern and can develop explicit knowledge of it.
20563279:27	Individual learners, during motor skill practice, can discover the correct solution to a movement problem using either their implicit, explicit or a combination of both domains of knowledge; each approach leads to motor skill learning.
20563279:28	The serial reaction time task, a classical example of ‘implicit’ knowledge acquired during sequence learning, is available for intentional control and is, in this sense, explicit.
20563279:29	Automatic and intentional forms of processing can be brought under intentional control.
20563279:30	Besides, explicit knowledge is an important and active variable that influences problem-solving processes, especially problem representation.
20563279:31	Individuals who have accumulated considerable explicit knowledge in a domain represent problems more efficiently than individuals without extensive knowledge bases.
20563279:32	In the face of strongly held explicit beliefs, knowledge gained through implicit learning is disregarded.
20563279:33	Hence, in normal humans, it is difficult to develop a pure task that allows only implicit or explicit knowledge to contribute to performance.
20563279:34	In particular, sophisticated skills are fueled by explicit knowledge.
20563279:35	Although the Dreyfus brothers recognize this division of knowledge, they believe that skills are exclusive instances of know-how or implicit knowledge: ‘you can ride a bicycle because you possess something called “know-how,” which you acquired from practice and sometimes painful experience’ ( p. 16).
20563279:36	The Dreyfus brothers assert that when we perform a skill, we basically execute implicit knowledge without a connection to explicit knowledge.
20563279:37	They believe that skills are automatic dispositions that cannot be readily made explicit.
20563279:38	They go further and propose that the net effect of learning is intuition and define it in terms of implicit knowledge: ‘when we speak of intuition or know-how, we are referring to the understanding that effortlessly occurs upon seeing similarities with previous experiences.
20563279:39	We shall use intuition and know-how as synonyms’ ( p. 28).
20563279:40	In summary, Dreyfus and Dreyfus define skills at expert level almost exclusively in terms of implicit knowledge.
20563279:41	A critical point is to accept whether or not clinical problem-solving skills are implicit in nature or if they are predominantly dependent upon implicit knowledge.
20563279:42	As we reviewed above, it is difficult to develop a task exclusively in terms of implicit knowledge.
20563279:43	Even more importantly, clinical problem-solving skills are also instances of explicit knowledge.
20563279:44	The clearest cases of explicit knowledge of a fact are representations of one's own attitude of knowing that fact.
20563279:45	Knowledge capable of such fully explicit representation provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for conscious knowledge.
20563279:46	This is the case when a physician evaluates a patient.
20563279:47	Although he is not aware of all of the cognitive steps needed to make a diagnosis, he needs to be conscious of at least of the following events: characterization of a patient's symptom, valuation of a patient's sign, and solicitation of a diagnostic test.
20563279:48	Furthermore, physicians explicitly provide a representation (diagnosis) and express the degree of accuracy or inaccuracy and can judge their representations to be true, false or undecided.
20563279:49	Hence, it is reasonable to accept that making a diagnosis also subsumes an explicit dimension of knowledge.
20563279:50	Therefore, a model that does not respect the complex and rich interaction between both domains of knowledge will have difficulty explaining skills that are not just routines but instead very complex tasks, i.e., finding solutions to problems.
20563279:51	Inverse problems and clinical problem-solving skills 
We will start the discussion of this section by pointing out that there is not only one type of problem, but several types.
20563279:52	Most problems can be classified into direct, well-defined problems and inverse, ill-defined problems.
20563279:53	Direct or forward problems are of the following type: given C (causes)→E (effects), find E (effects), where (→) symbolizes the causal relationships ( pp.
20563279:54	145–164).
20563279:55	These types of problems call for analysis, or progressive reasoning, either from premises to conclusions or from causes to effects.
20563279:56	In contrast, an inverse problem is a more complicated problem of the following type: given the clinical data E (effects = symptoms) and the acceptable causal hypothesis C 1→E, C 2→E,…, C n →E, find the original cause C.
20563279:57	Inverse problems require synthesis, or regressive reasoning, from conclusions to premises or from effects to causes.
20563279:58	Inverse problems also are ill-defined problems in the sense that a simple solution may not exist, there may be more than one solution, or a small change in the problem leads to a big change in the solution.
20563279:59	Well-defined and direct problems have a clear path to a solution.
20563279:60	The problem may be solved by using a set of recursive operations or algorithms.
20563279:61	In contrast, the cognitive processes involved in the solution of ill-defined problems are far more complicated and still ill-understood.
20563279:62	In the case of ill-defined problems, all aspects of problem formulation are challenging.
20563279:63	Most are fuzzy problems, often difficult to delineate and even harder to represent in a way that makes them solvable.
20563279:64	In addition, inverse problems imply a novelty for each case, and expertise should reflect an ability to react to situations that experts have never encountered before.
20563279:65	In this context, problems cannot be solved ‘automatically’ or only ‘intuitively.’
20563279:66	The Dreyfus model has been derived from observation of the performance of experts, such as jet pilots and dancers, experts who are used to tackling direct problems.
20563279:67	Is it correct to use this model also to explain the performances of experts who are used to tackling inverse problems?
20563279:68	It is plausible that often the skills involved in solving direct problems are not the same as those involved in solving inverse problems.
20563279:69	Think about the skills needed to solve this short list of inverse problems: to ‘guess’ the intention of a person from his/her behavior, to discover the authors of a crime knowing the crime scene, to ‘imagine’ an internal body part from the attenuation in intensity of an X-ray beam, to guess the premises of an argument from some of its conclusions, or to diagnose a sickness on the strength of its symptoms.
20563279:70	The investigation of those problems does not proceed downstream, from premises to conclusions or from causes to effects.
20563279:71	Working on all those problems involves reversing the logical or causal stream.
20563279:72	In medicine, physicians face inverse problems all of the time.
20563279:73	In fact, the typical diagnosis problem is not the direct problem of inferring syndrome from disease, but the inverse problem of guessing disease from symptoms.
20563279:74	Anyone who wants to propose a model to explain how we develop clinical problem-solving skills must recognize carefully that the skills used to solve inverse problems are of a different nature than the skills used to solve direct problems.
20563279:75	A model should be specific for skills of different natures; the Dreyfus model is not specific enough.
20563279:76	Rules and context 
In the Dreyfus model, a novice should memorize rules and should not feel responsible for other things: ‘to improve, the novice needs monitoring, either by self-observation or instructional feedback, so as to bring his behavior more and more completely into conformity with the rule.’
20563279:77	( p. 7).
20563279:78	Besides, the Dreyfus model supports the idea that at proficient and competent levels, performers should have developed ‘personal guidelines and maxims’ in order to be able to deal successfully with tasks and problems.
20563279:79	Why do we have to assume that these Dreyfus propositions are right?
20563279:80	Is that the way we learn skills of explicit or even of tacit nature?
20563279:81	Is it a good idea to memorize rules at novice stages?
20563279:82	Do proficient and competent physicians solve diagnostic problems using just a set of ‘personal’ rules and maxims?
20563279:83	Early problem-solving research proposed the ‘general problem solver model.’
20563279:84	In this model the solution of a problem is conceptualized as a movement between two states: a starting state, named ‘problem space,’ and a final state named ‘goal state’.
20563279:85	There are ‘rules of transition’ which refer to those functions that move the system from one state to another, and there are also heuristics tools, rules that determine which moves are to be made in the problem space.
20563279:86	Although this model gives great value to the use of rules, it should be recognized that these components are well suited for solving well-defined and direct problems, where the space and transitions between states are unambiguous.
20563279:87	However, the model offers no solution whatsoever for dealing with inverse problems, for which there do not exist simple rules to solve them.
20563279:88	In medicine, although there are clinical guidelines and algorithms available that can help physicians deal with some problems, physicians acknowledge that these ‘rules’ are just general recommendations.
20563279:89	Besides, physicians use ‘guidelines’ after they have transformed an inverse problem into a direct one.
20563279:90	This is after diagnostic hypotheses have been generated.
20563279:91	However, there is not a recipe to generate hypotheses.
20563279:92	Furthermore, physicians use heuristic rules, such as Occam's razor regarding parsimony, but these ‘rules’ are general recommendations.
20563279:93	They are explicit (not personal), and still it is not well known what impact they have on clinical problem-solving skills.
20563279:94	Rules are instructions for doing something, and even when they may be constructed as a mapping of possible actions (algorithms), they do not describe or explain any particular event or thing because they prescribe what to do.
20563279:95	If we accept that knowledge has a transferable content that has been encoded and externalized in cultural artifacts, such as a book, then we should recognize that rules are not the sole element of that content, because knowledge consists of thousands of concepts, propositions, and theories.
20563279:96	This knowledge allows us to grasp the nature of disease; understanding is a pre-requisite to learning.
20563279:97	The development of clinical reasoning skills for medical students is dependent on basic science achievements.
20563279:98	Novices, who rely on biomedical knowledge, solve complicated diagnostic problems with more success.
20563279:99	Believing that students should only memorize rules has a dark side and can cause deleterious consequences.
20563279:100	When rules are available for everything, novices can spare the effort of imagining a different way to solve an inverse problem.
20563279:101	Hence, they would tend to proceed to solve problems in a rather mindless way.
20563279:102	We should reflect on the fact that to learn, students need all kinds of stimuli, such as propositional from books and experience.
20563279:103	But they also need freedom to develop the talent to produce diagnostic hypotheses by spotting, inventing, and sometimes guessing.
20563279:104	Other elements to analyze are Dreyfus ideas that learners at pre-competent stages have a complete ignorance of the ‘context,’ and that the education at this level should be decontextualized: ‘normally, the instruction process begins by decomposing the task environment into context-free features which the beginner can recognize without benefit of experience’ ( p. 7).
20563279:105	Contrary to such an idea, we should acknowledge that everything in our world, including concepts, is interrelated.
20563279:106	Learning, as any other event, happens under specific conditions and should not be detached from the real experience.
20563279:107	Medical students always face the context.
20563279:108	Of course, at the beginning, there is not enough insight into every detail.
20563279:109	However, students’ minds are not like computers following a program; they have some ideas, some approaches, and some knowledge of the context.
20563279:110	For example, medical students can generate numerous diagnostic inferences, even without considerable clinical experience.
20563279:111	How can they do that if novices like them ‘ignore’ the context?
20563279:112	Accumulating experience is not a passive recording.
20563279:113	Learning is creative in the sense that it is new and not automatic to the individual.
20563279:114	Even at the pre-beginner stage, learners gain experience and understanding of the context.
20563279:115	Information, context, and experience cannot be separated.
20563279:116	Intuition 
The Dreyfus brothers propose that intuition is the endpoint of learning and a key characteristic of expertise: ‘the expert pilot, having finally reached this non-analytical stage of performance, responds intuitively and appropriately to his current situation’ ( p. 12).
20563279:117	Hubert Dreyfus describes a master as one with a lot of experience who produces almost instantaneously appropriate perspectives, who thinks intuitively, not analytically, and who ceases to pay conscious attention to his performance turning it unconsciously: ‘the expert, like masters in the “long Zen tradition” or Luke Skywalker when responding to Obi Wan Kenobi's advice to use the force “transcends” “trying” or “efforting” and “just responds”’ ( p. 22).
20563279:118	Adults often learn to drive a car, type, play chess, ski, etc.
20563279:119	In most cases we perform such skills intuitively, quickly, unconsciously, and ‘just respond.’
20563279:120	These everyday skills are relatively easy to acquire, at least to an acceptable level.
20563279:121	It is plausible that some steps required to perform a simple task are so fast that we consider them on an unconscious level even though we are alert and oriented.
20563279:122	Neuroscience tries to explain that there are two kinds of neuronal aggregations in the brain's organization: one is constituted of heavily interconnected neurons with long-range axons (named workspaces) and the others are system sets of specialized neuronal processors (perceptual, motor, memory, evaluative, and attentional) with short axons.
20563279:123	The latter ones are not enough to perform tasks that require great effort, so the workspace neurons are activated, making the effort conscious.
20563279:124	This mobilization is greater with complex cognitive tasks.
20563279:125	However, the popular conception that some simple everyday skills are performed fast and ‘unconsciously’ can explain neither the performance of difficult tasks nor the acquisition of sophisticated skills.
20563279:126	In the case of problem-solving skills, empirical studies have demonstrated a distinction between expert and novice problem representation in terms of the time spent on various stages of the problem-solving process.
20563279:127	Contrary to the idea that experts dedicate less time than novices, Lesgold found that experts spent more time than novices determining an appropriate representation of the problem.
20563279:128	Experts spent more time comparing their knowledge to the information they needed to discover in order to best represent the problem.
20563279:129	Even skilled rapid motor production, as in typing, is not simple nor is completely automatic.
20563279:130	Studies showed that expert typists look ahead to prepare for what comes next.
20563279:131	They acquire complex representations and skills to anticipate future actions.
20563279:132	Something similar happens in music, where the mark of expert performance is the ability to control one's performance and its results; there is not such a thing as an automatic and immediate response.
20563279:133	Expert music performance requires several different representations: ‘imagined music experience’ (desired performance goal), ‘playing a piece of music’ (how to execute the performance), and ‘listening to the played music’ (hearing one's performance).
20563279:134	The resulting music performance should not be seen as a fixed and automated sequence of motor actions.
20563279:135	It should be viewed as a flexible, controllable outcome based on these representations.
20563279:136	Consequently, it is hard to believe that the whole clinical problem-solving process is intuitive in the sense that it is unconscious, effortless, and automated.
20563279:137	Although the use of ‘pattern recognitions’ and ‘illness scripts’ can happen in an automatic way, especially when data or a prior experience triggers a possible diagnosis, this explains only one state of the whole problem-solving process.
20563279:138	Good physicians, although esteeming intellectual intuition because of its suggestive power, know that it can be dangerous: first, because intuition does not have demonstrative force, and second, because intuition is never fine enough.
20563279:139	Intuition, as a very fast and almost instant inference, consists of showing rather than demonstrating; in proving in a brief and imperfect way, and in rendering plausible the hypothesis that has been invented.
20563279:140	It is a kind of rudimentary reasoning that uses incomplete evidence, visual images, and analogies (prior experiences) rather than complete data, refined concepts, and detailed inferences.
20563279:141	A diagnosis formulated in an intuitive way will have to be worked out in a rational way and then tested by the usual procedures.
20563279:142	This is because the suspicion generated by the illness scripts and pattern recognitions are not proof of a diagnosis.
20563279:143	Further, this is why we use a lot of auxiliary tests and image studies.
20563279:144	Expert clinicians intentionally avoid any tendency toward automatization as they often lose control of many relevant aspects of a clinical encounter.
20563279:145	Ericson called this ‘deliberate practice’.
20563279:146	There is evidence that experts use two modes of thinking: analytic (hypothetic–deductive) and non-analytic (pattern recognition), even in perceptual specialties ( – ).
20563279:147	Both modes of thinking are part of a continuous process.
20563279:148	Expert physicians do not use analytic reasoning only after a failed attempt with non-analytic reasoning or the other way around.
20563279:149	Clinical medicine is one of the more complicated and challenging professions; it is very simplistic to explain problem-solving processes starting and ending with intuition.
20563279:150	Many diagnostic errors are due to overconfidence and heuristic availability, and some errors occur during non-analytic reasoning.
20563279:151	Intuition, because it is brief and readily accomplished and grasped, must be expanded to be validated.
20563279:152	Implications and conclusions 
Any model is a representation of a thing, and in this representation two elements play important roles: the represented and the representing things.
20563279:153	With this pair of elements we can make diverse kinds of representations: factual–factual (a scale model), factual–conceptual (a theoretical model), factual–semiotic (a scientific text), and semiotic–factual (a text illustration).
20563279:154	The acquisition of skills is a learning process and is obviously factual.
20563279:155	Hence the Dreyfus model attempts to be a factual–conceptual model, a theory or at least an outlook of how we acquire diverse skills.
20563279:156	Any fact–concept correspondence is of course difficult and not of the one-to-one type.
20563279:157	However, because it tries to be truthful, a theory must attempt to be coherent and related to the facts.
20563279:158	Although the Dreyfus model is not taken strictly as a ‘prescription,’ it is plausible that its descriptive face is influencing us to generate a worldview, a general outlook of how we learn and teach medicine.
20563279:159	Every worldview has an effect on our actions and policies.
20563279:160	And here is the point of major implication, because this model can influence educative policies, recommendations, and guidelines.
20563279:161	This model can also generate unhappy contradictions.
20563279:162	For example, it has been said that the Dreyfus model provides us with a framework for consistency within the evaluation system.
20563279:163	How can this model help us to ground our evaluation system if the model suggests explaining physicians’ performance in terms of implicit knowledge and intuition?
